    <title>Becca’s ‘buds’ beat out other words</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6OpJQeym4rvePZ9rpnBKF6HkEw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378711/VRG_ILLO_BeccaData.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buds, buds, buds, buds!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div id="CNRiWq"&gt;&lt;script src="https://d3js.org/d3.v7.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KwCqo9"&gt;After working on a data piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744897/verge-coverage-stories-data-charts"&gt;analyzing everything &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has ever written&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it might be fun to look at some other &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;data to see what I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaWNsm"&gt;Becca Farsace is one of the best sports we have on our team here, and she also has some of the most distinctive speech patterns — and catchphrases — so I asked her if she would let me dive into the data of her words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwMT6G"&gt;Her Slack response: “Wowee... I’m terrified, but go for it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ungVqp"&gt;We all have a tendency to use the same vocabulary and phrases from day to day — it’s a part of what makes us who we are, of course. So I pulled the transcripts of every video Becca has hosted on our YouTube channel (over 30!) to get an impression of her speech patterns. A few videos didn’t have transcripts, and I didn’t include videos where she was only a guest for ease of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWRrWZ"&gt;After collecting the raw transcripts and analyzing them, I took out some common words, such as “a,” “the,” “and,” “I,” and so on, and came away with some interesting findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9UvKjz"&gt;
&lt;div id="Becca_Data_BarChart"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;script src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23131058/Becca_Data_alt_BarChart.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dLMqBE"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/20725204"&gt;original version here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbq0eEjocU7wyaeQhS6ncjWrxtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161603/VRG_ILLO_4967_Becca_Bar_Chart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MIFZDV"&gt;In the chart above, you can see Becca’s top words across all videos she’s ever hosted. No surprise: “buds” is the top word with nearly 300 uses, followed by “really” and “camera.” “Buds” is a common term of endearment from Becca, referring to us the viewer, but it also reinforces what we already know: that Becca covers a ton of earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8FZ6jU"&gt;
&lt;div id="Becca_Data"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;script src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161554/Becca_Data_alt.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x4Ho64"&gt;You can view the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/20725204"&gt;original version here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-V2_8RJHW4oYqYxwRZ9I-t-PfD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161611/VRG_ILLO_4967_Becca_Scatter_Chart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="waPESh"&gt;By looking at Becca’s top words per video, we can see how her language shifts from video to video — generally to highlight the topic being discussed. Again, “buds” (highlighted in pink) takes the top spot here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcNkGw"&gt;The use of “buds” is increasing over time, too. Is this due to an ever-growing number of “buds” named products she reviews or a deeper personal connection with her audience?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TSfaG"&gt;Mostly, it seems to align with what she’s covering. They can be broken down into five buckets: action cameras, cameras, earbuds, phones, and an assorted bucket of everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OaZ2N3"&gt;Action Cameras, with six videos, didn’t have any particular word or phrase stand out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SJGFfq"&gt;Cameras had “camera” as the top word three videos out of a total of five.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JhVodu"&gt;Earbuds had “buds” as the top word in nine out of 10 videos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Sqp1p2"&gt;Phones, with three videos, had “Pixel” or “Pixel / iPhone” in two videos as the top word.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qckkAq"&gt;In the Other category, the top word seemed to match the topic of the video, with an even spread over five videos of “AI,” “fiber,” “video,” “board,” and “bike.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii3eYg"&gt;The data suggests that Becca’s speech most closely mirrors the topic she’s covering in each video, rather than being skewed by a favored catchphrase. Though it still goes without saying: Becca says buds &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqYIwR"&gt;“In my defense, ‘buds’ is a product category I cover, but it is also a part of my everyday language,” Becca told me. “Is it time that changes? Maybe I’ll let the buds decide.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to mute a word or phrase on Twitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9L9qO_CtfLAzWvVWNfupkuPkNE=/0x0:900x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378592/twitter.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-user-name"&gt;In February 2020,  I found that that it was possible not only to mute conversations or other accounts on Twitter, but (courtesy of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nonprofWHIT/status/1229964006330380289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1229964006330380289%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F2%2F19%2F21144097%2Ftwitter-mute-tweets-word-name-tag-how-to-settings-phone-desktop"&gt;a tweet by @nonprofWHIT&lt;/a&gt; ) that you could also mute a specific &lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;. And you could do it straight from a tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZRtti"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?s=20"&gt;Twitter has announced&lt;/a&gt; it is expanding this feature so that when you mute a word or phrase, it will not appear in your Explore tab or Event-based notifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CalAyd"&gt;Here’s how you go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPBAYz"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an iPhone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kiOUjU"&gt;If you’re using the Twitter app on an iPhone, it’s a quick and easy process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WDHN6T"&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="olIheA"&gt;Choose “Mute” from the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PEzRpO"&gt;You’ll be sent to a page where you can choose from where you want to mute the word (your timeline or notifications), from whom (anyone or people you don’t follow), and the duration (forever, 24 hours, seven days, or 30 days). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press on the word you want to mute. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct4FjssBFbrPRlqSFHRIEaTYgSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731703/IMG_589D3687AA11_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press on the word you want to mute. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select where you want to mute it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDH9hXswL9-N6bXW-V0tYJdiQvU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19731705/IMG_BB887E06D435_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select where you want to mute it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VevJJq"&gt;Mute words or phrases on an Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QEISnd"&gt;If you’ve got an Android phone, don’t despair. You can also mute words from the Android Twitter app (or, for that matter, from the iOS Twitter app) through the app’s settings. It’s not quite as fast as doing it directly from a tweet, but it’s just as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="dioGVM"&gt;Select your icon on the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="86FxuH"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aUmPGy"&gt;Tap “Muted words.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IWrdR2"&gt;Tap the plus sign and enter the word you want to mute. You then get the same choices as to where, from whom, and duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Android, you mute using settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTl99kR7ncdZUAn443VgaOsHAHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161869/Screenshot_20220111_164607.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Android, you mute using settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Enter each word or phrase separately." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h4oiyYduCftQXYz_BYEYRnba7lA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161872/Screenshot_20220111_164831.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Enter each word or phrase separately.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="78Fb6s"&gt;If you no longer want to mute the word or you want to extend the mute time, return to the “Muted words” screen, tap on the word in question, and choose the corresponding option (“Delete word” or “Change mute time”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can always delete the muted word." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MJM9RKxdhhrJusCZm98IBsSy0b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161887/Screenshot_20220111_164953.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can always delete the muted word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Are you sure?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0RO26hyhtA6H-OU6WSHsyeWV9GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161886/Screenshot_20220111_165009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Are you sure?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yGqJr7"&gt;Mute words or phrases on your desktop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kIw7dK"&gt;And finally, if you’re tweeting directly from Twitter’s website, you can mute a word from there as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mUDyjq"&gt;On your desktop, from the left-hand menu, click on “More” &amp;gt; “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Mute and block.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PlrwIF"&gt;In the right column, click on “Muted words.” Click on the plus sign in the upper right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0x5wni"&gt;Now you can enter the word or phrase you want to mute. As with the mobile Twitter apps, you can choose whether to mute from your timeline or notifications, from anyone or people you don’t follow, and for how long. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLiNAOQx6_OtIxogeghXdLHom1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161973/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_4.59.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On a desktop, you first find the “Mute and block” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1BIzId"&gt;When you’ve made all your choices, click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4rpSnz"&gt;If you want to unmute any words, go back to the “Muted words” column. Click on the red crossed-out volume symbol to the right of the word, and then click “Unmute” on the pop-up window that appears.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R66EzpN58QfNo7ElEtgaP5xvr2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161974/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_5.01.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to go back and unmute a word or phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7KYdrh"&gt;Some additional notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MIsPI2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options"&gt;Twitter has a number of ways&lt;/a&gt; you can mute different types of info in your timeline and notifications. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Tr9Tbt"&gt;You can also mute specific mentions of specific accounts (but not mute the account itself) by using the @ in front of the account name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hRELIu"&gt;If you mute a word, you will also mute that word’s hashtag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="znDiJJ"&gt;Muting is not case-sensitive (“spoilers” and “SPOILERS” will both work), and you can use a phrase with punctuation (“Hey, you!”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mdxx9i"&gt;Twitter is expanding the ability to mute words, phrases, etc. to areas other than timelines and notifications. Just yesterday, it announced that blocked or muted text would also no longer appear in Events-based areas:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="y91ggM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;First up, Events. Now across Android, iOS, and web, Events from accounts you’ve blocked or muted won’t appear in your Explore tab, “What’s happening” sidebar and emails, or Event-based notifications.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1480958895287939072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56qsSQ"&gt;If / when the ability to mute is extended even further, we’ll add it to this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3o5ip"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 12th, 2022, 10:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on February 19th, 2020, and has been updated to allow for UI changes and new features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s real antitrust problems are only beginning</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8naelf7jgn3YxECQ3DH0cKDx_0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378482/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yDBwde"&gt;Just over 13 months ago, the Trump-era Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166978/facebook-ftc-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp-tiktok"&gt;sought to break up Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit was a long time in coming — it sought to unwind acquisitions that were made in 2012 (Instagram) and 2014 (WhatsApp) — and, in its initial form, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/28/ftc-facebook-antitrust-complaint-dismissed/"&gt;was laughed out of court&lt;/a&gt;. The FTC had not plausibly demonstrated that Facebook had a monopoly, Judge James E. Boasberg ruled at the time, and thus could not proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqpxt9"&gt;Still, Boasberg offered the FTC a second chance: re-file the case with more evidence to support its central claim, and perhaps it could go to trial. In the intervening months, President Trump had been dislodged from office, and antitrust crusader Lina Khan took the reins at the FTC. To no one’s surprise, she took Boasberg up on the offer to file a revised case. And in a ruling issued this week, Boasberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;ruled that the case can proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HMwws"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/11/ftc-facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-move-ahead/"&gt;Cat Zakrzewski at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3terHN"&gt;The revised complaint included enough facts to “plausibly establish” that Facebook has a monopoly in personal social networking, referring to services that allow people to maintain relationships with family and friends online, Boasberg said. Boasberg said the “Achilles’ heel” of the FTC’s first complaint was that it was devoid of data supporting its claim that “no other social network of comparable scale exists in the United States.” But the revised complaint included data from the analytics firm ComScore, and argued that Facebook’s share of daily active users of apps providing personal social networking in the United States has exceeded 70 percent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxKFKJ"&gt;“In short, the FTC has done its homework this time around,” Boasberg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fhNW0G"&gt;The homework, incidentally, was not particularly elaborate: this time the FTC simply included some Comscore data about the time people spend using Facebook products, along with numbers of daily and monthly active users for it and other products in the space. It remains noteworthy, if unsurprising, that the Trump FTC could not manage to clear even that low bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPJhdr"&gt;In any event, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; said Boasberg had handed the FTC “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/11/technology/facebook-antitrust-ftc.html"&gt;a major victory in its quest to curtail the power of the biggest tech companies&lt;/a&gt;.” At the very least, the judge helped the FTC save face: after more than five years of lawmakers and regulators decrying the size and influence of Facebook, it would have been beyond embarrassing for the agency to fail even to bring its case to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JIdImb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it would have been beyond embarrassing for the agency to fail even to bring its case to trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Th7EqK"&gt;And yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166978/facebook-ftc-antitrust-instagram-whatsapp-tiktok"&gt;as I wrote when the case was filed&lt;/a&gt;, each passing year has weakened the FTC’s monopoly case, and the agency spent all of 2021 struggling to keep it viable. While the agency flailed, TikTok was born and reached enormous scope — in 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tiktok-google-facebook-social-media-internet/"&gt;it was the most visited website in the world&lt;/a&gt;, according to Cloudflare. The government would argue that TikTok is fundamentally different than Facebook, alleging that the latter holds a monopoly in something called “personal social networking services.” And yet anyone can open up Facebook or Instagram and notice, day by day, how they are gradually assuming more and more features of TikTok, the app it is supposedly so distinct from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9gH6v"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Facebook is now Meta&lt;/a&gt;, and “a metaverse company.” Questions about whether it’s possible to compete with Instagram or WhatsApp feel feel like questions of more interest to historians than to the next generation of entrepreneurs, which are contentedly (and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/signal-gets-a-new-ceo"&gt;foolishly&lt;/a&gt;) now rebuilding the entire internet — &lt;a href="https://www.deso.org/"&gt;social networks included&lt;/a&gt; — on the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5TtkS"&gt;One of the oldest arguments against breaking Facebook up was that the market would eventually end the company’s dominance anyway, and likely much faster than any lawsuit could. There’s no doubt that Facebook is still dominant in social networking. But there are cracks in its armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buFFaE"&gt;All of which makes it notable that while Boasberg allowed the case to proceed, he wrote that “the agency may well face a tall task down the road in proving its allegations.” Over and over again in the 48-page complaint, he notes that he is not yet allowed to assess the accuracy of the facts presented in the FTC’s case. Instead, his job is to determine whether the facts, if true, make for plausible allegations of wrongdoing. And at this point, he decides, they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTNGdr"&gt;(He stood fast in rejecting another part of the lawsuit case, which argued that Facebook had illegally restricted the transfer of data to third-party developers. That particular policy ended in 2013, making any wrongdoing feel like old news even by the standards of this case.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9a7at"&gt;Don’t get me wrong: I believe Facebook &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; make social networks less competitive when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp. And we’ll never know what consumer benefits we might have seen had those companies remained independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqECCa"&gt;But 2014 was a long time ago. And the coming lawsuit and inevitable appeals will stretch out for many more years. At this point, even if the government &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; successfully force a spinout of Instagram and WhatsApp, those companies will be reborn into a world that is moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBZHxd"&gt;The good news for consumers, and for competition, is that the FTC is moving on, too. Even if this lawsuit fails in the end, by filing it the agency has signaled that it will intensely scrutinize any future efforts by Meta to acquire other social networking products. And as new social networks rise up in the future, the lessons learned from Instagram and WhatsApp will almost certainly inspire much more rigorous reviews of future acquisitions in the space. (It’s already happening: in November the United Kingdom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22740272/facebook-giphy-acquisition-competition-and-markets-authority-uk-regulator"&gt;blocked Meta from buying a GIF search engine&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QnWfOZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;what Meta wants to buy in VR is far more important than what Facebook bought a decade ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3KdGP"&gt;Even better, from my perspective, is that the FTC has begun to train its attention where it actually belongs: on&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt; Meta’s efforts to snap up all the biggest studios and talent in virtual reality and augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;. When I wrote about that subject last June, Meta had already acquired Big Box VR, Unit 2 Games, Beat Games, Sanzaru Games, and Ready at Dawn. Then, in October, it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753403/supernatural-within-studio-facebook-meta-oculus-vr-fitness-experiences-metaverse"&gt; made one of its biggest purchases in the space to date&lt;/a&gt;: the Los Angeles VR company Within, makers of the breakout hit subscription fitness app Supernatural, for a reported $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0RNix"&gt;Meta owns the Oculus App Store, and has perfect knowledge about which games are selling well and converting Quest owners into daily users. In that sense, it’s the company’s sequel to Onavo,&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-onavo-gives-social-media-firm-inside-peek-at-rivals-users-1502622003"&gt; the Facebook app that once provided vital early warnings about upstart competitors&lt;/a&gt;. In 2022, what Meta wants to buy in VR is far more important to the future than what Facebook bought a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uBJQ5"&gt;That’s why I was heartened to see &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; report last month that the FTC has&lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal?utm_source=ti_app&amp;amp;rc=8aq5ai"&gt; opened a formal inquiry into Meta’s acquisition of Within&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LI9Frf"&gt;Meta’s first five VR app acquisitions went through without a hitch because they were too small to trigger a cursory review by U.S. antitrust regulators. But those regulators are slowing down the $400 million-plus Supernatural deal, according to two people with knowledge of the situation. Shortly after Thanksgiving, the Federal Trade Commission opened an in-depth probe of the acquisition, meaning Meta may not be able to finalize the acquisition for another year, assuming the agency doesn’t formally challenge the deal in court, causing additional delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VMiQYy"&gt;This is where the FTC’s attention actually belongs: not on the distant past, but on the still-up-for-grabs present, in which Meta pumps its profits into&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/oculus-will-sell-you-a-quest-2-headset-that-doesnt-need-facebook-for-an-extra-dollar500/"&gt; selling the Quest 2 below cost&lt;/a&gt; — to&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/vr-player-sales-numbers-christmas-2021/"&gt; great success this holiday season&lt;/a&gt; — and in acquiring all the most-used software in the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atcsE5"&gt;What happens to Instagram and WhatsApp still matters a lot. But what happens on next-generation platforms may matter much more. The bad news is that the FTC’s current lawsuit came too late to make a difference. The good news is that it seems determined not to make the same mistake twice.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Qn3GIe"&gt;Working from home is normal now. For some of us, it has become a permanent change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYxFMp"&gt;Thankfully, in these days of videoconferencing, texting, and file-sharing, it has been possible for many of us to move to home desks and offices and thrive that way. It helps that remote working was already a part of many people’s lives before COVID-19 appeared. But that doesn’t mean it’s been easy. It’s been an adjustment for many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWPojS"&gt;Now we’re taking the tech expertise of our staff, and the experience of our writers and editors, to put together our best tips and advice on working from home. For example, we give advice on looking for the best monitor, choosing a business-level file-sharing service, and buying a printer. (Yes, you might actually want a printer again!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UQpvm"&gt;Videoconferencing has become the best way to have face-to-face meetings, but what are the best conferencing apps? How do you keep your Zoom meetings private? And how can you look your best while on camera? We’ll tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhwB5b"&gt;We also look at ways you can make your home a more pleasant place to work, and share some of the devices our staffers are using to make remote working better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB7Zm6"&gt;We’ll be adding new articles every day on these topics in order to bring you as much information on working at home as possible. Stay tuned — and stay safe!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to choose the right printer for your home office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3GMgT2mBz8RXQD9I_081hmQxog=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66913848/VRG_ILL_4947_best_printer_recommendations.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTZRSG"&gt;The need for a home / office printer has increased as more of us are working or schooling from home. You could be a parent who needs to print out workbooks for your child. Or you may find that it’s easier to make notes on a business report using a pen or pencil rather than a keyboard. Or you’ve suddenly discovered that a government office is demanding that you snail mail a form to them. Or you’re tired of trekking to your local office supply store for printing out occasional forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrULau"&gt;Whatever the reason, if you find yourself in need of a printer, it’s not difficult to find one. Printers have not changed a lot over the past few years; they’ve just become more efficient and less expensive. You will still be choosing between laser and inkjet printers, color and black-ink-only printers, and print-only and multifunction devices. Because of all these decisions to make, it’s a good idea to figure out what you want before you click “buy” at your favorite shopping site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeqcFN"&gt;In this article, I won’t be telling you which specific printer to buy. But I will go through some of the choices you are going to be faced with and some of the features you may want to make sure you’re getting, including inkjet versus laser, multifunction versus single function, and how to decide what to buy and where to buy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGVhWI"&gt;So let’s start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sTGRpk"&gt;Inkjet versus laser printers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6m8xC3"&gt;If you haven’t bought a printer lately — or if you haven’t needed a printer until now — you may want a quick refresher on the difference between inkjet and laser printers. What follows is a vast simplification, but it will give you a general idea of how they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u4alml"&gt;Inkjet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n04fvi"&gt;Inkjet printers spray tiny droplets of liquid ink onto a page. There are several types of inkjet delivery systems, but most consumer systems use separate ink cartridges, each fitted with a printhead that separates the ink into the nearly microscopic droplets. (Professional-level inkjets will usually have separate printheads that can be replaced on their own.) Colors are created by combining different colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qSJmQ"&gt;The number of ink cartridges that a color inkjet printer uses varies. The least expensive printers usually use only two cartridges — one with black ink and one that contains cyan, magenta, and yellow ink. Most lower- to medium-priced inkjet printers offer four separate cartridges — cyan, magenta, yellow, and black ink. More upscale printers will have a different black cartridge for text; printers used by photographers or businesses will have a wider selection of colored inks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXxvrh"&gt;But even the least expensive inkjets can end up running into serious money. The printer itself may not cost more than $50 or $100, but a single set of cartridges can cost nearly as much. And because most color inkjets will not run at all if any one of the cartridges is out of ink (for example, you can’t just print in black if the cyan cartridge runs out), you’ll need to replace any spent cartridges. (We’ll deal more with ink costs later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6zK42"&gt;There are a few inkjet printers out there known as supertank printers, which have refillable tanks that offer a lower cost per page than the traditional ink cartridges. They are sold by a few manufacturers such as &lt;a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/inkvestment-tank"&gt;Brother&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.usa.canon.com%2Fshop%2Fen%2Fcatalog%2Fprinters-all-in-ones%2Fg-series-megatank-inkjet-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fecotank-ink-tank-printers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt;, and could be a consideration if you plan to do a lot of color printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXBsd2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10946129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="usxWmE"&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4a31bH"&gt;Laser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKVgzp"&gt;These devices use lasers to create static electricity on a rolling drum inside the printer. The static electricity attracts toner (ink in the form of powder), which is melted onto the paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fKVka"&gt;While toner cartridges initially cost more than ink cartridges, they also last far longer than liquid ink; as a result, your cost per page will be less. Laser printers also tend to initially cost more than inkjet printers — but they can save money over the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjUPwf"&gt;Laser printers have several other advantages over inkjet printers — unless you need color. They are faster than inkjets (especially low-end inkjets, which can be very slow), and the quality of their text printing is more precise (although current inkjets are certainly precise enough to suit most documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kda4sL"&gt;Color laser printers are also more available than they used to be. However, they are pricier, and unless they are professional-level printers, the color will not be as good as an equivalently priced color inkjet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1WJzVu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10946201"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Mge797"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NgG53g"&gt;So which should I buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hnIqxZ"&gt;There are several other factors to consider before purchasing a new printer. Here are some questions to ask yourself while deciding what to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qSaci3"&gt;What am I using it for?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PaBtGE"&gt;One way to decide whether to buy a laser or an inkjet printer is to look into what you want to do with it. If color is not important to you, then it’s a no-brainer. A laser printer will be more cost-efficient and faster. But if you want to print out your kids’ computer artwork in color or print the occasional photograph, then you’re probably in the market for an inkjet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Dzf4ZV"&gt;Multifunction printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8EIF3S"&gt;If you see yourself working from home for the foreseeable future — or even if you don’t — you may want to consider a multifunction (also known as an all-in-one or AIO) printer. These devices don’t just print from your computer, but they allow you to scan existing documents and either copy them or save them as files. (Some also let you fax a scanned document, but since faxing has become much less necessary, this feature is quickly disappearing.) They are very handy for keeping the paperwork around your home to a minimum since you can save PDFs of most of your papers (especially the ones you’ve had sitting around for years) and then dispose of the actual hard copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLosWg"&gt;(Yes, you can use your phone’s camera to scan and upload documents, and if you only occasionally need to scan a document, that could be enough for you. However, the quality of a phone-scanned document doesn’t come up to the quality of a good scanner.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EZELv"&gt;Most consumer-level multifunctions will let you copy anything up to an 8.5 x 11-inch paper (popularly known as letter-sized), but you can also buy printers that will let you handle an 8.5 x 14-inch (legal size) paper. If you see yourself doing a lot of copying or scanning, you should look for a multifunction with an automatic document feeder (usually referred to as an ADF) that lets you move a number of pages through the system quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RcCw64"&gt;Input and output trays&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lTJ3pa"&gt;Most current printers work by pulling paper in from the front, running it around the drum or roller, and then popping it out to the output tray. However, if you’re printing on heavier stock, you don’t want to bend the paper; in that case, you may want to look for a printer that has an input tray coming from the back of the printer, so that the paper is pushed through on a straight line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGyuHK"&gt;Some printers also allow you to have more than one paper tray in front, letting you choose different colored paper, for example, or having one tray hold letter-sized paper and the other legal-sized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6S3j"&gt;You also want to know how many sheets of paper your input and output trays are capable of holding. If you plan to, say, print out a 200-page manuscript, you don’t want an output tray that can only handle 50 pages, or you could find 150 of your pages strewn over your floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qdzEPd"&gt;Duplexing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f2jCES"&gt;The ability to duplex — to print on both sides of a single page — is more common than it used to be, but not all lower-priced printers include this feature. It’s very useful, especially if you do a lot of printing and want to save on the cost of paper. Of course, most printers let you print on both sides of paper by manually re-feeding the paper into the printer after the first side has been printed — but that can be a real pain in the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OLCqoS"&gt;Price per page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2HT7QU"&gt;Without a doubt, the biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink. There is a way to figure out how much a printer will cost you over the long term: calculate the cost per page by dividing the price of an ink cartridge by the cartridge’s page yield, or the number of pages you’re expected to get out of each cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrZqtr"&gt;You can usually find the page yield among the stats published by the printer’s manufacturer. For example, take two multifunction printers from the same manufacturer, one a color inkjet and one a black-only laser printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCblbL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest expense for a printer isn’t the printer itself or even the paper — it’s the ink&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e209CN"&gt;The yield of the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-envy-6055e-wireless-inkjet-printer-with-6-months-of-instant-ink-included-with-hp-white%2F6454281.p%3FskuId%3D6454281&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Envy Photo 6055e All-in-One&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for about $160, is about 240 pages for a high-yield black ink cartridge and about 200 pages for its high-yield tri-color ink cartridge. The high-yield black ink cartridge &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-67xl-black-ink-cartridge-high-yield-3ym57an-140/product_24430099" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs about $24&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-67xl-tri-color-ink-cartridge-high-yield-3ym58an-140/product_24430101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tri-color about $25&lt;/a&gt;. So that’s about 10 cents a page for the black ink and about 12 cents for the color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iv1Aee"&gt;A similarly priced black-and-white laser printer, the &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-laserjet-m209dwe-wireless-black-and-white-laser-printer-with-6-months-of-toner-through-hp-white-slate%2F6452950.p%3FskuId%3D6452950&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$170 HP LaserJet M209dwe&lt;/a&gt;, cites about 1,100 pages for a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.staples.com/hp-141a-black-standard-yield-toner-cartridge-w1410a/product_24506782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard toner cartridge&lt;/a&gt;, at a cost of about $48. That comes out to about 4 cents a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdJFfY"&gt;So assuming you pump out about 1,100 text-only pages in a year (excluding the cost of the paper), that means you’ll have paid a total of $48 more for the laser printer and $110 more for the inkjet, a difference of $62. (And that doesn’t take into consideration the fact that, using a color inkjet, you can’t print black-only unless all the ink cartridges are useable. In other words, if your kids use up your color cartridges, you won’t be able to print unless you replace them — even if you’re just printing in black.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRWOaU"&gt;One more thing to throw into the mix: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Black-Bottle-135ml-1VV24AN/dp/B07Z1GPV7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a black ink tank&lt;/a&gt; for the $400 &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-smart-tank-7001-wireless-all-in-one-inkjet-printer-white-slate%2F6477854.p%3FskuId%3D6477854&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Smart Tank 7001 Wireless All-In-One Inkjet Printer&lt;/a&gt;, which uses storage tanks instead of ink cartridges, costs $17 for a yield of up to 6,000 pages, well under a penny a page. (Because these types of printers — there are several — tend to use a differing number of tanks for color printing, it’s difficult to figure out an equivalent comparison for color printing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwLnKS"&gt;There are, of course, a lot of “ifs” here. For example, when you’re looking at lower-cost printers, some major printer manufacturers don’t publish the page yield. In addition, even when the page yield is available, you have to keep in mind that it’s being offered by the manufacturer — so the number of pages you get per cartridge is usually optimistic. Still, this can give you a fair idea of what you’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7KsJAk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10951449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3YstD"&gt;Wireless connectivity &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G2LxKG"&gt;When you’re purchasing a printer, make sure it is capable of wireless connectivity via Bluetooth, NFC, and / or Wi-Fi — and make sure it is compatible with whatever computer or mobile device you plan to use with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frZS7W"&gt;If you’ve got a Mac computer, an iPad, and / or an iPhone, make sure your printer is compatible with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201311"&gt;Apple AirPrint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn4DS0"&gt;If you’re using a Chromebook, make sure your printer is Chrome OS-compatible by checking the manufacturer site. (For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2FAccessories%2FPrinter-Accessories%2FChromebook-Printing%2Fp%2FCHROMEBOOKPRINT%23worksWithAccessories&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson has a page&lt;/a&gt; that lists all its Chrome OS-compatible printers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dYEKW"&gt;Until recently, another alternative was to use Google’s Cloud Print service, which let you easily print from computers and Android phones. Unfortunately, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;usual disregard for well-loved features&lt;/a&gt;, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977888/google-cloud-print-shut-down-date-support"&gt;shut down its Cloud Print service&lt;/a&gt; as of December 31st, 2020. The company’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/9633006"&gt;rather unsatisfactory advice&lt;/a&gt; (“we recommend the respective platform’s native-printing infrastructure or working with a printing partner”) will probably not be much help for those with older printers that depended on Cloud Print. You can check to see if your printer’s manufacturer has a mobile app that will allow printing from devices wirelessly in lieu of Cloud Print. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDDwMV"&gt;Finally, some printers have NFC capabilities. This lets you connect one to your phone by simply touching the phone to the NFC label on the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qPtu4n"&gt;Touch and non-touch LCDs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XG6cZr"&gt;Most printers today, even the most basic, come with LCDs that allow you to easily connect to your wireless network and tweak the printer settings — for example, if you want to always print double-sided, or to pull paper from a specific paper cassette. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G0Ig7"&gt;Unless you’re really into saving money, you’ll find it easier to deal with a touchscreen. Non-touchscreens usually mean having to hit a combination of buttons to navigate to the feature you want to access, selecting the feature, navigating to the setting, selecting it, and then getting back to the main menu. Touchscreens make that process a lot simpler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s35ufT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10496647"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ex62QD"&gt;Photo printers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V9rrsD"&gt;Unless you plan to fill up several albums with physical photos, a photo printer is probably not necessary. Some photo printers offer features like the ability to remove red-eye in photos of people, but this same functionality is commonly available in a number of photo apps (and is probably easier to deal with in software). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdTda8"&gt;There are exceptions. For example, there are small, portable printers such as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084CMMHVV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon SELPHY QX10 photo printer&lt;/a&gt; that let you immediately print small (2.7 x 2.7-inch) pictures. These are fun for family gatherings and parties. (Although be aware that you will have to buy special photo paper and ink for this one.) And if you’re a professional or would-be professional photographer, you may want to invest in a high-level photo printer. But otherwise, most midlevel color printers will — if you use good photo paper — do quite an adequate job. If you’re intending on printing a lot of photos, you’ll spend less and get better results from a photo printing service such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shutterfly.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shutterfly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XePZ98"&gt;Where should I buy it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NMiB13"&gt;Printers are available at almost any online or in-store venues that sell laptops and other computer equipment, such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=printers&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740374987942209261" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fbrowse%2FPrinters-Accessories%2Fci%2F18317%2FN%2F4042754070%3ForigSearch%3Dprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. You can also usually purchase a printer directly from the manufacturer — for example, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeChoosingPrinters051221&amp;amp;platform=dl&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fcv%2Fprinters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.canon.com%2Finternet%2Fportal%2Fus%2Fhome%2Fproducts%2Fgroups%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fepson.com%2Fprinters&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21279634%2Fbest-printer-recommendations-laser-multifunction-inkjet-canon-epson-brother-hp-home-office" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epson&lt;/a&gt; all sell from their websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obEQMV"&gt;As with any tech device, it’s always a good idea to check out the product in person before you buy — you may decide, for example, that the inexpensive printer you saw online feels too cheap when you examine it on the shelf. But for the most part, if you’ve checked all the specs online and read a few reviews, you’re pretty safe in ordering your printer remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro’s new delivery robot will include external airbags for pedestrians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nxiuy1eKekL4rHGsK9C9gnBq-VI=/428x0:3668x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378393/Nuro_Rendered_Airbag.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nXuUiV"&gt;Nuro, the autonomous delivery company, announced its third-generation autonomous vehicle with a host of new improvements, including a bizarre-looking external airbag for pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRZeyE"&gt;The company, which has a fleet of driverless delivery pods scurrying through the Southwest, says its new vehicle will have twice the cargo space as the second-generation R2 robot. It will also include modular inserts and new temperature-controlled compartments to keep food warm or cold, depending on the need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TriyR9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;twice the cargo space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0397dv"&gt;Nuro, which is valued at $8.6 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;was founded in 2016 by Dave Ferguson and Jiajun Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, two veterans of the Google self-driving car project that would go on to become Waymo. It is one of the few companies to be operating fully driverless vehicles — that is, vehicles without safety drivers behind the wheel — on public roads today. Its second-generation R2 vehicle is about half as wide as a compact sedan, shorter than most cars, and there’s no room inside for human passengers or drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3b5jac"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10972840"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0HRcit"&gt;For the new vehicle, the external airbag is certainly the most eye-catching new feature. A rendering of the airbag makes it look like an inflated mattress strapped to the front end of the vehicle. Since the vehicle is not intended for human drivers or occupants, Nuro installed the airbag on the outside for pedestrians in case of a collision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4ms5H"&gt;It’s the latest attempt by an autonomous vehicle company to account for the safety of people outside of the vehicle, such as pedestrians and cyclists. And while it may look silly on the surface — and who knows whether an external airbag will make a difference when the vehicle is traveling over 25mph — the fact that Nuro is thinking about how people interact with self-driving cars is refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msUUfG"&gt;Not to sound like a broken record, but Americans have traded sedans and small cars for huge trucks and SUVs, and the auto industry is responding by producing vehicles with higher carriages and larger front-ends. This has helped fuel a rash of pedestrian deaths, which are up 50 percent over the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d80bKw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nuro is thinking about how people interact with self-driving cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6SkXO"&gt;Vehicle makers have to account for the safety of the occupants in their vehicles but are not rated by the government on the basis of pedestrian safety. The Biden administration has called for an overhaul of the government’s five-star safety rating — the New Car Assessment Program — to include ratings for pedestrian impacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AcJ0J"&gt;Autonomous vehicles are held up as a potential solution to the rise in traffic fatalities, but there have been many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839535/waymo-collision-pedestrian-san-francisco-manual-mode"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834496/pony-ai-av-test-permit-suspend-california-dmv-crash"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644496/toyota-epalette-autonomous-shuttle-crash-halt-olympics"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690793/self-driving-shuttle-crash-las-vegas-manual-controls-locked-away"&gt;crashes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20951385/uber-self-driving-crash-death-reason-ntsb-dcouments"&gt;and at least one pedestrian death&lt;/a&gt;, associated with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGzneV"&gt;Nuro says the new airbag-sporting vehicle will go into production at the company’s manufacturing facility that is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642846/nuro-autonomous-delivery-factory-test-track-nevada"&gt;still under construction in Nevada&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle’s powertrain, which includes the electric motor and battery, will be made in the US by BYD, a Chinese company that is one of the largest manufacturers of electric vehicles in the world. The factory is expected to be fully operational later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scYcBv"&gt;The company is relatively unknown compared to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space, mostly because of its focus on delivery rather than human passengers. Still, Nuro has made incredible progress on the regulatory front, becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125358/nuro-self-driving-delivery-robot-r2-fmvss-exemption"&gt;the first company to receive a special exemption from certain federal safety requirements&lt;/a&gt; and recently getting the green light to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197980/nuro-licensed-autonomous-deliveries-california"&gt;charge money for its deliveries in California&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAjzZA"&gt;The company says it expects to eventually scale its business to include “millions” of customers, though it is not providing a timeline for when it hopes to achieve that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams’ Walkie Talkie feature now available to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jsii-FMFc6ChuyogSxMzAQ776hA=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378355/microsoftteamswalkietalkie.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emp3I5"&gt;Microsoft is making its Walkie Talkie feature of Microsoft Teams generally available to all users of its communications app today. Walkie Talkie lets Microsoft Teams users turn smartphones or tablets into a walkie-talkie that works over cellular data or Wi-FI. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058313/microsoft-teams-walkie-talkie-push-to-talk-feature-preview"&gt;originally announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt;, and has been in preview until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeAw8t"&gt;Microsoft has primarily pitched this at frontline workers, employees who are customer-facing and run day-to-day operations inside companies. The software maker is even teaming up with Zebra Technologies to add a dedicated push-to-talk button on a range of Zebra mobile devices. These devices are used widely by frontline workers, the employees that have helped steer the world through the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zuxSAahi5_6eXuKogswLurjdd94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163138/Walkie_talkie_on_Zebra_image.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walkie Talkie on Zebra devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kjEEza"&gt;Walkie-talkie features are still rare in communications apps. WhatsApp lets you record snippets of audio than can be sent and received, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;Slack launched its Discord-like Huddles feature&lt;/a&gt; last year to let people drop in and out of calls easily. Apple did launch its own walkie-talkie feature on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/4/17428180/walkie-talkie-apple-watch-facetime-audio-wwdc-2028"&gt;Apple Watch in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, using push-to-talk over a FaceTime Audio call.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Keychron Q2 review: a great keyboard, now more compact</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great choice for the space constrained&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="62vMSM"&gt;Last year, Keychron entered the world of high-end mechanical keyboards with the excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22662686/keychron-q1-review-price-mechanical-keyboard-features"&gt;Q1&lt;/a&gt;. It was compact, it was hot-swappable, it was easy to customize, and it felt amazing to type on. Now it’s taking a second swing at the premium market with the Q2, an even more compact keyboard that inherits much of what made the Q1 great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLc5fT"&gt;The big change with the Q2 is that it has a 65-percent layout, meaning it’s missing the function row that the Q1 had. That makes it more compact (obviously), but if you want to access the function keys, you’ll have to use the Fn2 modifier. It means that choosing between the Q1 and Q2 comes down to whether you prioritize a compact layout or having more keys at your disposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9GbEq"&gt;My Q2 review sample also has a rotary knob on the top right of the keyboard, which by default controls your computer’s volume. This dial is also available as an option for the original Q1, but it came out after the original keyboard launched and after our review was published. So think of this review as being part Q2 review and part Q1 rotary knob review. Cool? Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oY0D2F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10972203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JZfyhC"&gt;Like the Q1, the Q2 is an expensive wired keyboard. It currently starts at $149 for a bare-bones version without switches, keycaps, or a rotary knob. Adding the rotary knob costs an extra $10 ($159), and adding switches and keycaps costs an extra $20 ($169). Getting the keyboard fully assembled with a rotary knob will set you back $179 (this is the version I’ve been using, in its stock configuration, with Gateron G Pro Brown switches). Keychron characterizes these as early prices for initial customers and says it expects to see prices increase in mid-2022. If you want it with a UK or European layout there’s no fully assembled option and you can only buy it as a bare-bones keyboard, which sucks for me personally. You get a detachable USB-C cable in the box that’s braided, but not coiled, and it’s fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JS9HHR"&gt;The Q2 is hot-swappable, so you can install or replace its switches without any soldering. As standard, you get a choice of Gateron G Pro linear red, clicky blue, or tactile brown switches. It also has per-key RGB backlighting, and the switches are south-facing, if you’re the kind of person who cares about that sort of thing. (That should provide better compatibility with third-party keycap sets, particularly those from GMK.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KfgLF_BJ5zwQkuLFaK-TgXPTMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161255/jporter_220110_4961_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Q2’s switches are south-facing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNPwwL"&gt;Even in its bare-bones configuration, the Q2 is a lot more expensive than Keychron’s other 65-percent keyboards like the K6 (which costs just $59 and is wireless to boot). The reason is build quality and customizability: the Q2 (and Q1 before it) is in a different league of typing quality compared to Keychron’s other keyboards, and it supports QMK software, which means you can completely customize what each of its keys do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d21xOL"&gt;I expected to start this review by saying that the Q2 feels and sounds identical to the Q1 to type on. But Keychron has made a small change to the construction of the Q2 with the addition of an extra silicone gasket between the top and bottom sections of its case that reduces the slight “pinging” sound the original Q1 would make while typing. It’s a small change, but it’s a nice improvement. Keychron tells me it’s also incorporated this design element into the knob version of the Q1 and will roll it into the base Q1 from June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="0jnncO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10972938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j5OAZu"&gt;Otherwise, the Q2’s typing experience is every bit as excellent as the Q1. It feels crisp and solid, and the keyboard’s stabilizers (the mechanisms that stop larger keys like the space bar from wobbling) don’t rattle when their keys are pressed. It’s a premium package and exactly what you’d hope for with a keyboard costing this much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G5oP7OYrBP-nJvsuz9JVwLVIw00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161256/jporter_220110_4961_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Q2’s USB-C port and Mac/Windows layout switcher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svhMUqxfiwcfJLIXIAKUuw1-Ues=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161259/jporter_220110_4961_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newton’s cradle not included.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q9Ejan"&gt;I like the keycaps that come included on the fully assembled version of the Q2. They’re made of hard-wearing PBT plastic, have double-shot legends, and use a somewhat uncommon OSA profile. That means they have a slightly rounded look to them (similar to &lt;a href="https://thekeeblog.com/overview-of-different-keycap-profiles/"&gt;SA keycaps&lt;/a&gt;), but they’re shorter and less stylized, which makes them easier to type on for me. Considering they only add an extra $20 to the cost of the keyboard alongside the switches, I think buying them is an easy decision if you like their design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9KqS8"&gt;In classic Keychron fashion, you get both Mac and Windows keycaps in the box, and a small switch next to the keyboard’s USB port flips it easily between its Mac and Windows layouts. There are no adjustable feet to change the angle of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eFkDNU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mac and Windows keycaps are supplied in the box&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HOawYU"&gt;Whether or not the Q2 is the right keyboard for you will, I think, come down to whether you can live with its 65-percent layout. In my experience, the compact layout is a real love-it-or-hate-it design. Its proponents love how compact it makes the keyboard, but for others the lack of a dedicated function row, and the more limited number of keys around the arrow key cluster, are deal-breakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sH4xl"&gt;Obviously, you should follow your personal preferences, but I’ve generally found that a 65-percent layout is usable on a Mac but occasionally tricky on PC. For starters, the default keyboard shortcut for closing a program on PC is Alt + F4, relying on a physical key that’s not present on 65-percent boards (on the Q2 you access it with Fn2 + 4). Macs can also use  Cmd + Left and Cmd + Right as simple Home / End commands, so there’s less need for dedicated keys. But everybody’s different, and keys that might be optional for me might be essential for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjABoMx2SCcbYEOe-VEC7cgvlZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161254/jporter_220110_4961_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stock keycaps are easy to recommend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9KkNb7"&gt;It helps that the Q2 is QMK compatible, so you can use a program like &lt;a href="https://caniusevia.com/"&gt;VIA&lt;/a&gt; to customize its layout and ensure it has exactly the keys you want. Don’t like that the two keys on the far right of the Q2 are dedicated to Delete and Home out of the box? You can change them! (But you might need some extra keycaps if you want to change their legends). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gn1ezW"&gt;VIA is a relatively intuitive piece of software to use, and once you’re set up it’s easy enough to start reassigning keys to perform different tasks. The most unintuitive element is that the Q2 has five separate “layers,” which can each be programmed independently. There’s 0 for Mac, 1 is Windows, 2 is Mac while holding the Fn1 key, 3 is Windows while holding the Fn1 key, and 4 is both Windows and Mac while holding the Fn2 key. It’s less confusing than it sounds in practice, but if you’re trying to change your layout and it doesn’t seem to be working, then this could be why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uJR7wU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s relatively easy to completely remap the keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4pSEca"&gt;It’s also VIA that lets you remap what the Q2’s optional rotary dial does. The dial has three functions — scroll left, scroll right, and press — which by default handle volume and muting. It’s a relatively stiff mechanism that means you need to be firm with it, but it’s easy enough to rotate with a single finger. I just wish it didn’t have a weird square cutout around it, which is presumably so it can use the same keyboard case as the non-dial version of the keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAr5P1"&gt;I wanted to see if it could be turned into a tool for scrubbing through music and videos, and you know what? It totally can. Changing its purpose is as simple as working out the relevant keyboard shortcut in your software of choice and assigning it to the dial. So I mapped Ctrl + Cmd + Left and Right to the dial using macros, which allowed it to be used to scrub through files in VLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofjihk"&gt;Better still, because the Q2 supports multiple layers, you can assign functionality like this to the dial without having to give up basic volume controls. So my VLC controls only activate if I hold down Fn1 while I turn the dial. I could even use Fn2 to set up a third set of rotary controls, if I were so inclined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6YS72"&gt;Overall, the dial is a great addition to the Q2 (or the Q1). Yes, it costs an extra $10, and takes the place of one of the keyboard’s keys, but it’s flexible enough that I think it earns its place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rotary dial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WmLqwoPvMdAyPFeYMma6R7-mqiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23161253/jporter_220110_4961_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Q2 has per-key RGB backlighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZMovTJ"&gt;Last year I said that the Keychron Q1 was the keyboard to get if you want a high-quality, premium typing experience without having to assemble a keyboard yourself or go through a lengthy preordering process. And the Keychron Q2 is no different. It’s well made, easy to customize, and feels great to type on. It even sounds a little better than the Q1 to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kHxGVV"&gt;Whether you opt for the Q1 or the Q2 basically comes down to whether you love or hate the Q2’s more compact design, and what you need to use your machine for on a daily basis. Its layout certainly won’t be for everyone, but if you value a compact keyboard above all else, then it’s hard to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From mesh networks to lap desks, here’s how The Verge’s staffers create their workspaces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8meJ3q"&gt;It’s been nearly two years since many of us started working from home due to the pandemic, and if you haven’t yet adjusted your workspace to accommodate your needs, then it’s probably time to get to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4me3Vy"&gt;Whether you’ve set yourself up in the guest bedroom, on your living room couch, or in a walk-in closet, you may need a little extra effort to make it possible to type comfortably, meet online, or just concentrate. Sometimes it means buying a new desk, lamp, or monitor; sometimes it just means finding a household item that will make life a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITcH40"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they’ve been using to make their work-at-home situations more practical, more pleasant, or simply more possible. Here are some of the answers we got.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccfh3Y"&gt;I basically live in my AirPods Pro during the day. They let me listen to music, catch Slack pings, and take calls, all with the added benefit of some noise cancellation to help drown out outside noise. Their range is also great for my apartment — I can be anywhere in the house without losing connection to my computer, which is really nice if I need to step away from my desk to, say, microwave my second cookie of the afternoon. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3ZzJ9d"&gt;Phone as webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lBd28P"&gt;Webcams are no longer a struggle to find in 2022, but if you want to save money, turning your phone into a fully functional webcam is surprisingly easy, cost-effective, and can yield good results. I already had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review"&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt; sitting around, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21225061/phone-tablet-android-ios-phone-tablet-pc-webcam-windows-mac-os-how-to-use"&gt;with these steps&lt;/a&gt; that work on most Android and iOS devices, I now have a phone-meets-webcam. It’s got picture quality roughly on par with a standalone webcam, which might cost you around $100. If you want a stand that can angle it during calls, I’d suggest picking up one of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GripTight-GorillaPod-Stand-PRO-Compatibility/dp/B01C7UYCWW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these Joby GorillaPod tripods&lt;/a&gt; that includes a phone clip. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hrYlj8"&gt;I go through tons of batteries with my flash when photographing at home, and I find that these rechargeable batteries last so much longer than regular single-use batteries. Not only do they save me trips to the store and keep more batteries out of the landfills, but they also save me money in the end. —&lt;em&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="f5e8yx"&gt;This Thunderbolt 3 dock lets me switch my whole desk setup (keyboard, mouse, speakers, ethernet, display, external storage drives, and microphone) from one computer to another by just moving one cable. I plug all of my peripherals into the dock, and then just use the one Thunderbolt cable to hook up my Mac or whatever Windows machine I need to test at the moment. It also has a very useful high-speed SD card slot on the front, which is great for whenever I need to dump images from my camera onto my computer. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jrjDdT"&gt;Last year, I installed a Google Nest Wifi router with a mesh point. I’ve had a lot of networking equipment over the years, and this was immediately the best. And it was extremely easy to set up. A year later, my system with one router and three points is still going strong. —&lt;em&gt;TC Sottek, executive editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RhEAqu"&gt;An ultrawide monitor is the best purchase I ever made for working from home. It’s so big I have to physically lean from side to side to see it all. I can have three full-size windows up at the same time or countless windows overlapping. (Right now, I have nine different windows open and it doesn’t feel cramped at all.) Mine is an old LG 34UM94-P that they don’t make anymore — it looks like there is an updated version, the LG 34WN80C-B. However, any monitor that is at least 34 inches in size with 1440p or better resolution is what I recommend. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="kMa5qF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We heard from two staffers about this desk:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5QBq3"&gt;I love my Jarvis desk from Fully. It’s a solidly built desk that looks great in my office, and it’s really handy to have the option to sit or stand while working. If you’re considering one, I highly recommend spending the extra cash for the extended-range height, which lets the desk get lower for sitting and higher for standing, and the programmable height switcher, which lets you preset heights that you can switch back and forth to just by pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyjsHY"&gt;I also sprang for the $29 casters so I could wheel the desk around my apartment, which lets my wife and I use it as a mobile entertainment system. When we’re done working for the day, we can roll the desk over to our comfy chairs and watch Netflix or play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; on the desk’s monitor. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i94S6q"&gt;I have the Jarvis, too, just in a larger size. It has served me well for about four years now. It’s a comfortable, stable, spacious desk that has more versatility than typical desk options. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DGz3Ar"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306098" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="tnSiHd"&gt;I should work at a desk more, but I spend a lot of time working from a couch. It’s bad for me, but also very comfortable. Using a lap desk like this one helps me at least pretend to be a little more conscientious about my posture; plus, it’s helpful for writing on physical paper (or when my laptop gets too hot). —&lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, senior reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eok6fF"&gt;This monitor mount brings my screen up to a nice height so that I don’t hunch over, and it’s the tallest one I’ve found. Other monitor arms I tried just weren’t tall enough for me when I was standing while working — and I’m not that tall at 5 feet, 11 inches. The mount also lets me adjust my monitor to exactly the right height for movies or &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; when I’m using my desk as a mobile entertainment center. (Note: This monitor mount is no longer available; however, there is a similar model.) —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OdA2UU"&gt;The desk chair that I use is the Herman Miller Sayl, which used to sell for around $500 — the low end of that company’s lineup, believe it or not. I almost purchased this chair in mid-2020 when the chair I had was really causing me physical anguish, but Vox Media allowed me to borrow it from our NYC office. So I immediately drove there, stuffed it into my car, and brought it home. My cats and I really like it. (Note: The chair now costs over $900, but you can still get it for around $600 if you eliminate several of the adjustable features.)  —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QvLndi"&gt;While all of my work and most of my writing happen on my computer, sometimes it’s easier (especially for sudden phone calls or when I don’t want to switch out of a video) to simply turn to the notebook I keep next to my laptop and jot down a note or two. And I’ve found that using a classy pen is not only good for my morale, but makes it a lot less likely that I’ll find myself out of ink (or with a hand cramp) when I need to get something important written quickly. Currently, I’m using a True Writer ballpoint pen from Levenger that I got as a birthday present, but any pen that makes you feel good will do. —&lt;em&gt;Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make your home office a more pleasant place to work</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPy8KzlBzKS7Es3gv2eJj5o6ITM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378168/VRG_ILL_4947_Pleasant_home_office.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KRugiK"&gt;This pandemic has more people working from home than ever before, but it’s not all lollipops and daffodils. While there may have been some early excitement about not commuting or being breathed on by Chet the Xerox Tech, an actual home office can be downright depressing and / or uncomfortable. I should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue7mgc"&gt;As someone who has freelanced for the great majority of the last decade, I’ve worked from home nearly that whole time — even when home was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311668/how-to-live-your-best-vanlife"&gt;a camper van&lt;/a&gt; for more than five of those years. Yes, that was a tight space for a home office, but those constraints led me to refine my WFH game to keep my body healthy and my mind at least partially sane. Here are some of the tips (and items) that made the biggest difference for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lCf0Im"&gt;Desk setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I0xo2R"&gt;If you only do one thing on this list, make sure your desk and chair are comfortable. That’s broad advice, but it kind of has to be, because each body is different. What you find comfortable might be a medieval torture device to me. Case in point: I once bought a desk online that had rave reviews, but it turns out that if my chair is set to the proper height, the front of the desk digs into my thighs. Not ideal! So, if at all possible, try to sit at a desk before you buy it. You might also consider &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/jarvis-standing-desk.html"&gt;a standing desk&lt;/a&gt; which increases the number of positions you can work from. Personally, I couldn’t find one that worked with the rest of my setup (I’m a sucker for lots of drawers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqkkm"&gt;I’d argue that the chair is even more important than the desk. You’re going to want something ergonomic and with adjustable lumbar (lower back) support. Working hunched over &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200681/"&gt;can &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687016300515"&gt;destroy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15093-2"&gt;your &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/health-effects-of-poor-posture/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;, and your shoulders, your back, and your neck will all suffer. Chairs can cost a pretty penny, but they don’t have to. Craigslist, OfferUp, Nextdoor, and similar sites can be treasure troves for used office chairs. I read good things about the &lt;a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/"&gt;Herman Miller Aeron&lt;/a&gt;, so I went and tried it out in a store, then I found a gently used one on Craigslist for about 30 percent of the cost of a new one. You might also look into gaming chairs, as they are built for long periods of sitting. Just make sure it will fit with your desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LuY9vH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets"},{"title":"Our 14 favorite gadgets and hacks for working at home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252470/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vaGGQ4"&gt;Last for this section, let’s talk about what goes on top of your desk. Depending on the line of work you’re in, a second screen can be a real game-changer, so consider an extra monitor for your desktop or laptop. It allows for vastly easier multi-tasking with much less clicking around. If you use a laptop, it might be especially revelatory. Personally, I recently switched back to a desktop setup (a Dell tower with an Intel Core i7, an Nvidia RTX 3070 and 32GB of RAM, which has been great for photo and video editing as well as VR gaming breaks), and instead of two monitors, I went with one big one which I can divide into halves or quadrants. I chose the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeHomeOffice010422/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-monitor-u3219q/apd/210-aqzz/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell UltraSharp 32 4K monitor&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in love with it. If you don’t photo or video edit, you may not need something that high-end. The point is to give yourself more space to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jGDnji"&gt;Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mhdi9g"&gt;There are a bunch of different studies that explore how different shades of light can impact our minds and bodies. They could affect everything from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/color.html#:~:text=Blue%20light%20has%20the%20strongest,fall%20asleep%20and%20stay%20asleep."&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, to alertness, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130806203150.htm"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1779263/"&gt;our productivity at work&lt;/a&gt;. My best advice is to set up your office near a big window that gets decent light, but I know that isn’t always possible. The next best thing, in my view, is a set of color-changing lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv9GV5"&gt;Personally, I’ve been using &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglNJrOC3ot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue&lt;/a&gt; for years, and I even set them up inside my van, back when that was my home. Philips spent a lot of time working on its light recipes, and the system comes pre-programmed with “Energize” and “Concentrate” settings that I genuinely find useful. Personally, I use Energize when I first wake up, then Concentrate (which is slightly warmer) for the bulk of my workday. When I’m ready to start winding down I’ll switch it over to the Reading setting, which I find warm and relaxing. There are a lot of other brands of color-changing lights out there, and if they don’t have presets like those I mentioned, you can experiment with different shades of light (bluer for more alertness, redder for relaxing, or something like that). It’s a small thing, but it really makes a huge difference in the way your home office feels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FLKQD"&gt;Plants and animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzIIP7"&gt;There is something about surrounding yourself with living things that makes your home office feel more natural and less like a sterile shoebox. Having a few houseplants can really change the feel of the whole room, and they can even make the air slightly fresher. I would recommend putting them near your desk, but also close enough to a window so they get plenty of light. If that’s an issue, you can get a hydroponic garden — for example, I recently got the small &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frisegardens.com%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-indoor-garden&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rise Garden&lt;/a&gt;. I am bad with plants, but it enabled me to grow lots of fresh herbs which made my apartment smell amazing. If that feels excessive (or expensive) then you can just start with this cool-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=32566716924009&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22510721__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snake plant&lt;/a&gt; that we’re kind of obsessed with (it’s $35). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdkkCe"&gt;As far as animals, I know a lot of people who adopted pandemic puppies and kittens. That’s cool, and maybe that’s a great fit for your life, but it definitely wasn’t for mine. So, I got a hummingbird feeder called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSH7VA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the HummZinger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simple hummingbird feeder with several birds drinking at the flower-shaped holes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loBoIXWPwDkEAKqZxVCN3p1-3O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145255/414165.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Aspects&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HummZinger. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJQIQ"&gt;I got this one because it is simple, yet still has anti-ant and anti-fly protection. I am now obsessed. I can see the feeder from my desk, and whenever one of those little guys shows up, I stop what I’m doing and just watch. On days when I’m frying my eyeballs on my computer screen, it really helps me feel like I’m still a part of the natural cycle. You can get a regular bird feeder if you like, but I wasn’t interested in constantly cleaning bird poop off of my little outdoor space, and hummingbirds are nice and tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LChZF3"&gt;Take care of your body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sP6Sat"&gt;Eliminating your commute may actually have some negative impacts on your body, especially if your commute involved some amount of walking or biking. These days you could conceivably not leave your home for days on end, and being that sedentary really isn’t good for you. Get up and move, and get your heart pumping. You don’t need a fancy home gym. Get a yoga mat and watch some YouTube workouts that require only your body weight. Force yourself to go for walks, even when you don’t wanna. Stretch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7fiZ"&gt;I also tend to get a fair amount of knots in my shoulders (and in my legs if I actually go running). For those I really like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhyperice.com%2Fproducts%2Fhypervolt-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hypervolt 2&lt;/a&gt; massager. It is incredibly powerful, highly portable, and it comes with five different attachments for different stubborn muscles. Coming in at just under $300, it isn’t cheap, but it’s been worth it to me. The other thing I’m currently obsessed with is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38678&amp;amp;u1=VergeHomeOffice010522&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.llbean.com%2Fllb%2Fshop%2F65637%3Fpage%3Dmens-wicked-good-moccasins" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this pair of slippers from LL Bean&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just so warm and comfy I pretty much work in them all day, and then lounge in them the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OZZzzV"&gt;Snacks and meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dmKdFn"&gt;This is one of the trickiest items. Suddenly you have unfettered access to your fridge and snack cabinets, and it can be very tempting to just graze all day. So, what do you do? Here’s the strategy that has worked better for me than anything else: Fill your kitchen with healthy foods, and only healthy foods. Yep, really. If I wander into my kitchen, wanting a snack, and there are chips there, I’m going to eat those chips. But if I go there and the only snackable foods are carrots and sugar snaps, then that’s what I’m going to eat. Basically, I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony, and it really works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIO29e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdDXCu"&gt;Beyond the superficial reasons for eating healthier, doing so will lead to better, more sustainable energy levels, as opposed to spikes and crashes. Not only can I subjectively feel the difference, but when I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22794594/levels-health-glucose-fitness-tracker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed this continuous glucose monitoring system&lt;/a&gt; I was able to get hard data to back it up. When your kitchen is full of tasty but highly-processed foods, you have to have the willpower to make the healthy decision every time you want a snack. It’s easier to just be strong once, at the grocery store, and then you don’t have to make those tough decisions a dozen times a day in your own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4fdwBu"&gt;Calling it a day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ68uz"&gt;You’ve got to know when it’s time to quit, and then you need to step away. This used to be a more delineated status for a lot of us: If you were at the office you were working, and if you weren’t at the office then it was your personal time. Working from home makes those lines a lot blurrier. It can easily feel like work never stops or that you always have to be reachable. Set some limits for yourself for your own mental health. Get your work done, and when office hours are over, get up, and walk away from your computer for a while. You’ll be happy you did, and you’ll come back to your “office” tomorrow more refreshed and ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iwjx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
