    <title>Valve’s new Steam Deck can run Windows and turn into a handheld Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jl_onTA11NfqBzd8mp_UptXfhbo=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586973/Steam_Deck_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s new Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XVuudl"&gt;Valve just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;announced its new handheld Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, powered by a custom Linux operating system. The 7-inch device will play the latest AAA games, and because it’s a PC, you’ll even be able to install Windows on it. That means the Steam Deck could be the perfect Xbox portable, given Microsoft’s investment in shipping all of its future Xbox Game Studios titles on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GHHkR"&gt;“Steam Deck is a PC so you can install third-party software and operating systems,” says Valve, which means this hardware isn’t locked down in the way we’re used to seeing from tech companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvCWgy"&gt;The Steam Deck itself will ship with SteamOS, a custom Linux operating system that loads into the familiar Steam interface you’re used to on PC. While Linux support for gaming has been improving in recent years, less than 15 percent of all games on Steam support Linux and SteamOS. That’s 7,586 games out of a possible 54,280 on Steam, compared to only 13 games on Steam that don’t work on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5CyR9C9Qm6UrHitttZ4oBzj9Ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719886/Steam_Deck_touchscreen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck ships with the Linux-based SteamOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JVJV3q"&gt;Installing Windows on the Steam Deck would open this device up to the thousands of games on Steam that aren’t listed as SteamOS compatible yet — you can check to see if the games you play are supported over on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;amp;tags=-1&amp;amp;category1=998&amp;amp;os=linux"&gt;Valve’s Steam site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgpFf2"&gt;When you look at the hardware inside the Steam Deck, it’s even closer to a portable Xbox than you’d expect. A custom AMD GPU will power the Steam Deck, complete with eight RDNA 2 CUs, and up to 1.6 teraflops of performance. That’s slightly more than the Xbox One S (1.4 teraflops), and slightly less than the PS4 (1.8 teraflops). It’s a modern RDNA 2 architecture, so it’s difficult to compare teraflops alone, but it certainly looks like it will be powerful enough for handheld PC gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4O30SG"&gt;Obviously, the possible downsides to installing Windows will be whether there’s full driver support, and the struggles of a desktop UI that’s not optimized for a handheld device. It’s also not clear just how well games will perform on Windows on the Steam Deck, so there are a lot of unknowns until the device launches in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxQe11"&gt;That said, handheld gaming PCs are slowly emerging as viable alternatives to the giant rigs or hefty laptops you typically need to play PC games. A Switch-style &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22320306/aya-neo-handheld-gaming-pc-indiegogo-price-release-date-nintendo-switch"&gt;Neo Handheld launched&lt;/a&gt; on Indiegogo earlier this year, and the 5.5-inch &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console#/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22001420__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GPD Win 3&lt;/a&gt; is the latest in a series of GPD handhelds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6zMi2"&gt;We’ve been getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;close to a Switch-sized gaming PC for over a year&lt;/a&gt;, and Valve’s Steam Deck device is the first to really bring the idea to the mainstream. Now we just need to find out how well this &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; runs games, and just how easy it is to get Windows up and running.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black teen barred from skating rink by inaccurate facial recognition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrB7Vnydtt8xmRob_Kqa1NMLtwQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586965/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ih1afT"&gt;A facial recognition algorithm used by a local roller skating rink in Detroit wouldn’t let teen Lamya Robinson onto the premises, and accused her of previously getting into a fight at the establishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgKXLE"&gt;But Robinson had never even been to the rink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIZ4A4"&gt;The facial recognition system had incorrectly matched her to another patron, she told &lt;a href="https://www.fox2detroit.com/news/teen-kicked-out-of-skating-rink-after-facial-recognition-camera-misidentified-her"&gt;Fox 2 Detroit&lt;/a&gt;. The rink removed her from the building and put her outside alone, her family says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnf5zs"&gt;“To me, it’s basically racial profiling,” Juliea Robinson, her mother, told the TV station. “You’re just saying every young Black, brown girl with glasses fits the profile and that’s not right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDJOOP"&gt;The harms of facial recognition systems deployed in businesses and by police have been slowly coming to light as the technology is more widely used. Research into these algorithms has shown that they are &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/how-is-face-recognition-surveillance-technology-racist/"&gt;far less accurate&lt;/a&gt; when distinguishing between the faces of Black people, women, and children, which might help explain the error faced by Lamya Robinson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuuO1w"&gt;The highest-profile case of facial recognition leading to a wrongful arrest was also in Detroit, in the case of Robert Williams. Williams was arrested and detained for 30 hours in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/technology/facial-recognition-arrest.html"&gt;January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, after being accused of shoplifting from a Shinola watch store. He &lt;a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?EventID=4635"&gt;testified&lt;/a&gt; in front of the House Judiciary Committee, urging for legislators to adopt a moratorium on the technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303355/facial-recognition-ed-markey-ayanna-pressley-ban-federal-agencies-fed-law-enforcement"&gt;introduced as legislation&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQjTc3"&gt;“I don’t want anyone to walk away from my testimony thinking that if only the technology was made more accurate, its problems would be solved,” Williams said in his testimony. “Even if this technology does become accurate at the expense of people like me, I don’t want my daughters’ faces to be part of some government database.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsi3FI"&gt;The disparity in racial and gender accuracy, as well as the invasive nature of the technology, has led to civil rights organizations and politicians calling for bans. The American Civil Liberties Union has called for nationwide bans and is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/michigan-father-sues-detroit-police-department-wrongful-arrest-based-faulty-facial"&gt;suing the Detroit Police Department&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of Williams for its misuse of the technology. Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;states like Maine&lt;/a&gt; have already begun to limit police use of the technology. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;only Portland, Oregon&lt;/a&gt;, currently has laws limiting how private businesses can use facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cgknwv"&gt;Civil rights nonprofit Fight for the Future announced that more than 35 other organizations had joined it in demanding that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576236/retail-stores-facial-recognition-civil-rights-organizations-ban"&gt;retailers stop using facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in their stores. The group reiterated its position today after the report of Lamya Robinson’s experience getting kicked out of the skating rink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lgx3eW"&gt;“This is exactly why we think facial recognition should be banned in public places,” wrote Fight for the Future’s director of campaign and operations Caitlin Seeley George in a press release. “It’s also not hard to imagine what could have happened if police were called to the scene and how they might have acted on this false information.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the finalists to be included in Emoji 14.0 this September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rows of emojis including biting lip, a troll, coral, lotus flower, bird nests, beans, glass spilling water, slide, tire, ring buoy, hamsa, disco ball, low battery, crutch, X-ray, bubbles, ID card, and heavy equal sign." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVTMrl7gx2BJSH5qvr3CzNf7wos=/70x0:615x363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586504/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_12.52.47_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikbVom"&gt;The draft list for the next round of new emoji was &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;, two days ahead of &lt;a href="https://worldemojiday.com"&gt;World Emoji Day&lt;/a&gt; on July 17th. Contenders include a melting smiley face, a low battery, a disco ball, and several new hand shapes — like heart hands and index finger pointing at viewer — for courting your sweeties or taunting your enemies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cG8b2v"&gt;The release of new emoji was delayed this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214865/unicode-emoji-delay-2022-android-ios-mobile-release"&gt;because of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, and proposal submissions were on pause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387628/new-emoji-submissions-unicode-subcommittee"&gt;until April&lt;/a&gt;. This list won’t be finalized by the Unicode Consortium until September, but in general, most candidates shown in the draft make it through. The final versions should roll out to different devices and platforms starting in late 2021 through 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drafts of new emoji that will likely make their debut in Emoji 14.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uhl7GW"&gt;The new emoji show a continued expansion of race and gender inclusivity. The current lineup has customizable skin tones for the handshake emoji, a person with crown to hang out with the existing prince and princess emoji, and a pregnant man and pregnant person join the pregnant woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jRL4Nf"&gt;I am personally very excited for the beans emoji, something I’ve longed for ever since I named my dog Bean a few years ago. I also plan to get a lot of mileage out of the X-ray emoji, because I can’t get enough emoji that have a little eeriness to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJpZnn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters contributed proposals for the saluting face and bubbles emoji. You can also thank him for the yawning face and waffle emoji that were introduced in 2019, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;read about that creative journey here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Go is available now for $299</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OkDtMFY1fNY2D4v8pTblXqRiSkQ=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586416/01_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_silver_front_open.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5t2znu"&gt;Samsung’s new entry-level Chrome OS laptop, the $299 Galaxy Chromebook Go, is available to purchase now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/galaxy-chromebook-go-14---silver--wifi--xe340xda-ka1us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Samsung’s website&lt;/a&gt; and other retailers. While only the Wi-Fi model is available Thursday, Samsung plans to offer an LTE model in the coming weeks, which should be a nice extra perk for web browsing on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biXaV4"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go’s modest price seems to be reflected in its features. It’s got a 14-inch 1366 x 768 HD display, a definite step down from the 4K OLED panel that shipped on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305763/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-now-available-best-buy-price-specs-features"&gt;the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also working with an Intel Celeron N4500 processor and 4GB of RAM, which probably won’t set the world on fire, but should be enough for casual Chrome use.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3cnYOdbecnHSkqcVRz6uXKwwas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719584/13_galaxy_chromebook_go_wifi_sivler_dynamic1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook Go features USB-C ports and a USB-A 3.2 port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxl6eZ"&gt;Samsung claims the Galaxy Chromebook Go’s 5480mAh battery should last 12 hours on a single charge, which in comparison to the Chromebook 2’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;around seven-hour battery life&lt;/a&gt; (in our tests) is great, but also is probably related to the differences in display and processors between the two models. Internal storage comes in at 32GB (expandable if you’ve got a microSD card handy) and the Chromebook Go includes one USB-A 3.2 port, two USB-C ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD card reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTkmGK"&gt;You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;our Chromebook guide&lt;/a&gt; if you’re in the market for a new lightweight laptop, but if Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook Go speaks to you (and you’re not waiting for LTE), you can purchase it now &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/galaxy-chromebook-go-14---silver--wifi--xe340xda-ka1us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from Samsung’s store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s gaming handheld is called the Steam Deck and it’s shipping in December</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SDGR1DAtGtjFDWRWvDOQwCVUOOo=/0x77:1831x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586299/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5OBXhG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453584/valve-portable-gaming-pc-switch-rumor-report"&gt;long-rumored&lt;/a&gt; Switch-like handheld gaming device. It will &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;begin shipping in December&lt;/a&gt; and reservations open July 16th at 1PM ET. It starts at $399, and you can buy it in $529 and $649 models as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOVBpo"&gt;The device has an AMD APU containing a quad-core Zen 2 CPU with eight threads and eight compute units’ worth of AMD RDNA 2 graphics, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. There are three different storage tiers: 64GB eMMC storage for $399, 256GB NVMe SSD storage for $529, and 512GB of high-speed NVME SSD storage for $649, according to Valve. You can also expand the available storage using the high-speed microSD card slot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HtEuJXjiJ2Q32S9JmW9o_eWDZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719726/Steam_Deck.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YNcm9k"&gt;The Steam Deck has a huge number of control options. There are two thumbsticks, but also two small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;Steam Controller-style&lt;/a&gt; trackpads beneath the thumbsticks, which could give you more precision for things like first-person shooters. The front of the Steam Deck also has ABXY buttons, a D-pad, and a 7-inch 1280 x 800 touchscreen for 720p gameplay. The device also has a gyroscope for motion controls. Like the Switch, it has two shoulder triggers on each side, and there are four back buttons (two on each side) as well as built-in microphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPTxT8"&gt;Here’s a legend to all of the Deck’s ports and controls:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="Y6rEHc"&gt;As for the battery, “Steam Deck’s onboard 40 watt-hour battery provides several hours of play time for most games,” Valve says. “For lighter use cases like game streaming, smaller 2D games, or web browsing, you can expect to get the maximum battery life of approximately 7-8 hours.” &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-faq-big-questions-answered"&gt;Valve tells &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “You can play &lt;em&gt;Portal 2 &lt;/em&gt;for four hours on this thing. If you limit it to 30 FPS, you’re going to be playing for 5-6 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ect1S"&gt;And if you need to pause your game, the Steam Deck offers a quick suspend / resume feature built into SteamOS that will let you put the device into sleep mode and pick up where you left off later.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2A03I7gXXViF2X4eknuZ_0SpD-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719843/steam_deck_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vBIjbp"&gt;Valve will also sell a dock you can use to prop up a Steam Deck and plug it into external displays like a TV. You won’t need a dock to plug it into a TV, though — Valve says that the “Deck can be plugged in to your TV, monitor, or even your old CRT if you have the right cables.” The Deck comes with fully-fledged USB-C ports that contain HDMI, Ethernet and USB data, as well as standard Bluetooth. You’ll have native Bluetooth audio, something that’s missing from the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TFliW"&gt;On the software side of things, the Steam Deck runs what Valve is calling “a new version of SteamOS,” that it’s optimized for the handheld’s mobile form factor. But the actual OS is based on Linux, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_(software)"&gt;will use Proton&lt;/a&gt; as a compatibility layer to allow Windows-based games to run without requiring that developers specifically port them for the Steam Deck. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaLNiQ5p6O2eYAFo41flFzd2Eo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719673/Image_from_iOS__5_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the device showing off its four grip buttons, triggers, bumpers, vents and Switch-esque design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DRCPU4"&gt;Ultimately, though, the Steam Deck is still a full-fledged Linux computer, meaning that more technical users will be able to jump out to the regular Linux desktop, too. Valve notes that you’ll be able to plug in a mouse, keyboard, and monitor, and install other game stores, regular PC software, browse the web, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbrAYY"&gt;Valve says the Steam Deck’s features are designed to emulate the regular Steam app on desktop, complete with chat, notifications, cloud save support, and all of your library, collections, and favorites kept in sync. And if you want more power, you’ll be able to stream games to the Steam Deck directly from your gaming PC using Valve’s Remote Play feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="STG26n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10653722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vf0ZQa"&gt;When reservations for all three versions &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;open on Friday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, they’ll initially be available only to accounts with purchases on Steam before June 2021, in a bid to keep reseller bots at bay. There’s also a refundable $5 reservation fee, and one reservation per person. Your reservation isn’t exactly a preorder, but it does put you in line to preorder the system once there’s inventory available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpvpfD"&gt;In December, the first units will be available in the United States, Canada, the European Union, and the United Kingdom, with other areas following in 2022. The preorder invitations are supposed to go out before December, and if you miss your window on the invite, your reservation fee will be refunded to your Steam Wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8zEOK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-hands-on-impressions-details-valve-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; got an early, exclusi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/valve-announces-the-steam-deck-a-400-handheld-gaming-pc"&gt;ve hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the Steam Deck, which you can watch below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P7poQo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLtiRGTZvGM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RR57ox"&gt;IGN also got an interview with Valve’s Gabe Newell, who said that Valve designed the whole system with “very aggressive” pricing in mind, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-price-valve-gabe-newell-400-dollars-painful-but-critical"&gt;calling it a “critical” and “painful” aspect&lt;/a&gt; of development. That’s a different strategy than Valve took with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, when it intentionally tried to push the industry forward with what was then the most expensive consumer-grade VR experience, at $999. Here, a $400 entry-level Steam Deck comes in just $50 more expensive than Nintendo’s new OLED-equipped Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date"&gt;which goes on preorder for $350 today&lt;/a&gt; and ships October 8th. (Valve swooped in on that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwDk4g"&gt;Valve’s Greg Coomer told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; that should the Steam Deck succeed, the company’s already thinking about future models, and offering the “building blocks” to other manufacturers as well. “We look at this as just a new category of device in the PC space,” he said. That might bring back echoes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;Valve’s failed Steam Machines initiative&lt;/a&gt;, in which it tried to encourage partners to build desirable Linux gaming desktops, but with key differences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twn5xO"&gt;This time, Valve has created its own hardware first, it doesn’t need to sell every game developer on Linux ports, and this “category” of PC already exists to some degree: we’ve written about how Windows portables &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;have been edging closer to the dream of a Nintendo Switch-like gaming PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Record high tide flooding hit coastal communities last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington’s Tidal Basins Sea Walls Crumble Due To Rising Sea Levels" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuT46Kf9SaYmWGdRVW8WKJQrAqk=/0x121:5013x3463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586234/1159645477.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A walkway at the Tidal Basin leads to a flooded sidewalk from the rising high tide on July 2nd, 2019, in Washington, DC. The Tidal Basin’s crumbling seawall and sidewalks are routinely under water due to the rising sea levels high tides and threatening some Cherry Blossom Trees.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Mark Wilson / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWWNR5"&gt;High tide flooding hit record levels in the US last year and is only expected to get worse, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/us-high-tide-flooding-breaks-records"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Coastal communities experienced twice as many days with high tide flooding last year than they did 20 years ago. Records were either matched or broken in 14 places across the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coastlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqTExA"&gt;Nationally, coastal communities were hit with a median of four days of high tide flooding in the past year — although some places suffered through more than quadruple that number. NOAA’s outlook for the rest of the year until April 2022 rises to three to seven days of flooding. But because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;sea-level rise&lt;/a&gt; tied to climate change, the long-term forecast is more alarming: 2030 could see seven to 15 days of flooding. And 2050 could bring on a whopping 25 to 75 days of high tide flooding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBwD2l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBsocG"&gt;That could harm&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;roads, waste, and stormwater systems, NOAA warned. With high tide flooding becoming much more frequent, cities and neighborhoods will need to adapt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MiAcXO"&gt;“For the first time in human history, the infrastructure we build must be designed and constructed with future conditions in mind along the coast,” said Nicole LeBoeuf, director of NOAA’s National Ocean Service, on a press call yesterday. “These data that we provide help communities plan where to put their buildings and how to keep people safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Pd4P"&gt;High tide flooding, also called “nuisance” or “sunny-day” flooding, inundates streets and homes with water levels that reach up to two feet higher than the average high tide. While low and high tides are &lt;a href="https://scijinks.gov/tides/"&gt;caused by the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, this nuisance flooding is driven by additional factors.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;As average global temperatures rise, oceans expand and push seawater even further ashore. The situation for coastal residents gets worse in places where land is subsiding or natural coastal barriers are eroding. Things will get even&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;trickier in the mid-2030s when a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/study-projects-a-surge-in-coastal-flooding-starting-in-2030s"&gt;regular wobble in the Moon’s orbit&lt;/a&gt; will combine with sea level rise to cause higher tides, a new analysis by NASA found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozDLWQ"&gt;Real estate valued at &lt;a href="https://toolkit.climate.gov/topics/coastal-flood-risk"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt; is vulnerable to coastal flooding — and we’re not just talking about summer beach homes. By 2050, the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747466/rising-sea-levels-flood-affordable-housing-2050"&gt;affordable housing units&lt;/a&gt; vulnerable to flooding could triple as a result of climate change, according to one study published last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wNh6Py"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZupP0"&gt;Costly floods that in the past might have only posed a threat during a storm, might now be triggered by merely a change in prevailing winds or currents or even a full Moon, according to NOAA. The agency tracks 97 tide gauges across the US, and it looked at May 2020 to April 2021 for its new report. Eighty percent of the places where it collects data along the Southeast Atlantic and Gulf coasts saw an uptick in flood days. (The West Coast was spared some flooding because of a La Nina last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr7I4C"&gt;In some places, the change has been extremely swift. People living along the western Gulf of Mexico saw 17 flood days last year — an astonishing 1,100 percent increase from what they experienced in 2000. Residents along the eastern Gulf had nine flood days, a 600 percent jump over the past two decades. The Southeast Atlantic coast got eight flood days, a 400 percent rise from 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bIihf"&gt;“We’re seeing a dramatic change in just two decades, and the conditions are changing not just in a few locations,” LeBoeuf said. This change isn’t confined to the US.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Coastlines around the planet are at risk for more frequent and extreme flooding. The frequency of severe flooding in the tropics, for instance, could get 25 times worse by 2030, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/18/15658342/flooding-sea-level-rice-melting-ice-climate-change-extreme"&gt;previous research&lt;/a&gt; has found. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet is getting a wider rollout on Google Glass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Woman using Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrQlxf2lOO9fALSFBiJQL7Mo1V0=/85x0:1023x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586218/header_2880x1200.max_1500x1500.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;googleglass,glassenterprise,google glass enterprise&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPLxEh"&gt;Google Meet videoconferencing is adding fuller support for Google Glass, the company’s frequently overlooked augmented reality headset. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/open-beta-now-available-to-all-workspace-customers"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; an open beta of “Meet on Glass” for the Glass Enterprise Edition 2. Users with Google Workspace can sign up to test the service following &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/google-meet/introducing-google-meet-for-glass-enterprise-edition-2"&gt;a closed beta&lt;/a&gt; announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyfoVW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21516402/google-glass-meet-beta-enterprise-edition-remote-work-skype-microsoft-hololens"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/a&gt; laid out last year, Meet on Glass works differently from normal online videoconferencing. When a Google Glass wearer connects, other participants get a first-person view from the headset camera. Google pitches it as a collaborative remote troubleshooting tool for the business-focused Glass Enterprise Edition, replacing less hands-free options like capturing a video with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of Google Meet running on Google Glass" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1L0q_BYB0cnu4iRMmKSP8uSt3l4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719538/meet_glass_3.max_1600x1600.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ucDBkQ"&gt;Glass failed as a consumer product, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21121472/google-glass-2-enterprise-edition-for-sale-directly-online"&gt;it found new life&lt;/a&gt; as a $999 enterprise headset that serves a similar niche to Microsoft HoloLens and (as of last year) Magic Leap headsets. Microsoft promotes a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhololens%2Fapps%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DnOD%2FrLJHOac%26ranSiteID%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26epi%3DnOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528nOD_rLJHOac-ofGlDuYCcO.zMYaHbydpfw%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ipxesw3rjokfqn0kkk0sohznbv2xudrp3o3hpyrz00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;paid HoloLens remote assistance tool&lt;/a&gt; that works similar to Meet with Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger’s new sound emoji let you hear Fast and Furious quotes in your chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhIkeOocq_JSq7PxH-Fe5DZRrgI=/69x0:821x501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69586197/Soundmoji_Still_3_Up_FB_Newsroom_en_US.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nDT2sw"&gt;Facebook is adding emoji with sound to Facebook Messenger. The name for them, of course, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/introducing-soundmojis-on-messenger-for-emoji-day/"&gt;is Soundmojis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsIPT8"&gt;To access Soundmojis, tap the emoji button while you’re in a Messenger conversation, tap on the sound icon on the far right, and then scroll through the list of available options. Just tap on an emoji to preview the accompanying sound and then hit the “send” button to drop it into your conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FGBYpd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are expected sound effects and some surprising ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQf3Vx"&gt;Some of the sounds are expected: the goat emoji utters a bleat, while the clapping hands emoji plays an applause sound effect, for example. But some are musical, such as the hourglass, which plays Drake’s “you only live once, that’s the motto” lyric, and the sun, which plays a clip from Kanye West’s “Good Morning.” And some of the emoji play clips from TV shows and movies: the right-facing fist bump emoji plays Dominic Toretto’s famous “I don’t have friends, I got family” line from &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 7&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URCREx"&gt;Be sure to keep checking the list of emoji as time goes on. Facebook says it will update it “regularly” with new sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnwnXB"&gt;The news arrives ahead of World Emoji Day, which happens &lt;a href="https://worldemojiday.com/"&gt;every July 17th&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want a preview of new emoji that might be hitting your devices soon, check out the draft candidates &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/"&gt;for Emoji 14.0&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new website makes it really easy to turn Twitch clips into TikToks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqOCUappzfezdkJ_T26j7lhR7wE=/0x205:2252x1706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585922/Screen_Shot_2021_07_14_at_4.40.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crossclip’s interface.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Streamlabs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mKqmlW"&gt;Logitech-owned Streamlabs, maker of the popular livestreaming app Streamlabs OBS, is releasing a new tool today called Crossclip that lets you take your favorite Twitch clips and turn them into social videos formatted for platforms like TikTok, YouTube, or Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpgM9E"&gt;The tool is free for anyone to use on the &lt;a href="https://crossclip.com/"&gt;Crossclip website&lt;/a&gt;. It has some smart features that let you quickly generate a shareable video that highlights both the streamer and the game they’re playing. A video for TikTok, for example, might show the streamer on top and their game cropped beneath them in a vertical format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U57B0S"&gt;I’ve been playing around with Crossclip for a couple of days, and I’ve found it really easy to use. It could be a very useful tool that lets streamers quickly turn a big moment on their stream into something they can share on other platforms — an important tool for expanding their audience beyond Twitch. Since anybody can use it based on any clip, though, that also means a casual viewer could make a video of a streamer that goes viral on their own social media, which the streamer themself may not want.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ny3QhbT3-NYp9ry7TbPk5GnzrsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718432/Screen_Shot_2021_07_14_at_4.49.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Streamlabs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some presets layouts in Crossclip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="avA1Yc"&gt;You can start making a video by submitting a link to a clip on Twitch or uploading a file from your computer. You’re then taken to an editing interface (seen in the image at the top of this post), where you’re able to choose different focus areas from your Twitch clip to be output in a vertical video for TikTok, a widescreen video for YouTube, or a square for Instagram. There are also some additional options like different preset layouts for your video like a picture-in-picture mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llkGT1"&gt;The app is free to use, but Streamlabs offers more editing options with a premium &lt;a href="https://crossclip.com/pro"&gt;Crossclip Pro subscription&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $4.99 per month or $49.99 per year. It includes the ability to remove Crossclip’s watermark and outro that are baked into each video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrfRIa"&gt;Once you’re happy with your clip, hit the compile button. With the free version, the video compiles at 30fps and 720p, but with a Pro subscription, you can compile it at 60fps and 1080p. When the video is ready, Crossclip will send you an email so you can download the video and share it on social media. And if you download the Crossclip app on iOS and log in, your created clips will show up in the app, and you can share them to social networks from there if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMqGEZ"&gt;As streamers continue to work to expand beyond just what they can share on Twitch so they can get noticed, Crossclip could be a valuable tool to take a highlight and more easily share it with the world with just a couple of minutes of work.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The game makers and artists pushing Roblox to its limits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4OCcArNNyhTGFTOjLzu9w_XMSRs=/231x0:1670x959/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69585780/Screenshot__757_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climb The Giant Man Obby.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Creators are putting their own spin on the virtual realm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="77pGAl"&gt;Like so many &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players, digital artist Everest Pipkin has their own abandoned birthday world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWebjP"&gt;Last year, when the pandemic made in-person gatherings impossible, Pipkin downloaded Roblox Studio, the platform’s game creation software, to construct a digital space to host their own party. It’s still &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5839500553%2Fbirthday-zone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;publicly accessible&lt;/a&gt;, a giant mountainous landscape packed full of hang-out spots and, befitting the celebratory occasion, a balloon dispenser. Friends rolled through virtually over the course of six hours, an event Pipkin describes as “goofy,” “strange,” and, above all, “lovely.” In fact, Pipkin was so taken with the platform that they decided to use it to build a new project entirely within it. The so-called &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F5987685753%2FRoblox-Dream-Diary-wip&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a little different from the &lt;em&gt;birthday zone&lt;/em&gt;; it allows players to peek into the most intimate recesses of its creator’s nocturnal mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuZIQJ"&gt;Log on to any of the worlds in &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary,&lt;/em&gt; and you might first notice the ways it differs from others in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. The harsh, bright lines that have come to define the platform’s blocky aesthetic make way for softer gradations of light; colors, too, are muted in tone. This gentler visual approach extends to the audio; in “Herons,” one of the diaries accessible from the hub, you’ll hear the quiet chirruping of birds amid bright dawn sun. Be warned, though: the floor eventually disappears sending the player into infinite freefall — the stuff of classic nightmares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="awfWNa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roblox, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RulQxN"&gt;Pipkin, whose work includes everything from &lt;a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/#games/junk.html"&gt;DIY board games&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://everest-pipkin.com/#games/mirrorlake.html"&gt;delicate interactive art&lt;/a&gt;  to &lt;a href="https://anticapitalist.software/"&gt;anti-capitalist software licenses&lt;/a&gt;, is part of a crop of game makers and digital artists whose heads have turned toward &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; throughout the pandemic. Pipkin started exploring the platform alongside game maker and curator &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/v21"&gt;V Buckenham&lt;/a&gt;, which is precisely what Ricky Haggett, maker of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the recent heartfelt puzzler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506636/i-am-dead-review-pc-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, did with an international group of pals, including Australian game designer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GhostTownGoldie"&gt;Marigold Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;. Digital artist &lt;a href="https://maxbittker.com/"&gt;Max Bittker&lt;/a&gt; has started his own &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F7019688123%2FSheep-Dog-Simulator&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent experiments&lt;/a&gt;, and then there’s the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; works by Terry Cavanagh, whose past commercial games include the critically lauded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/8/3300423/play-this-super-hexagon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Hexagon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/8/15/20807408/dicey-dungeons-review-terry-cavanaugh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dicey Dungeons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F6574475351%2FClimb-the-Giant-Man-Obby&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Climb the Giant Man Obby&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is a fiendishly difficult platformer brimming with his signature sense of humor and charm. (If you’re wondering, the obby in its title is &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; parlance for “obstacle course.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nJkD5"&gt;One of the most notable things about &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is how instantaneous it is. Rather than booting it up like you would a regular video game, its worlds are accessed from a webpage on your internet browser. You search a term or, more likely, scroll through what’s popular at any given moment, pick a world depending on its thumbnail, and, whoosh, you’re in. It feels closer to navigating a social media app, which, of course, is also kind of what &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is — every creator and player has a profile and friend lists. Because avatars and controls remain the same across nearly every game (newly labeled “experiences” following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;), there’s nothing new to learn besides rules. “You’re just in this new space fending for yourself,” says Pipkin, “and the immediacy of these micro-games is a delight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9l9Ts"&gt;Immediacy extends to Roblox Studio itself, which is like a refined version of 3D game engines Unreal and Unity. However, there are two big differences, according to Pipkin. The first is the tool’s multiplayer component, which means numerous people can jump into the same project remotely. One person can be terraforming the landscape, sculpting vast mountains and deep river beds, while another imports 3D objects — a third could be scripting events. It is, says Pipkin, “remarkable... possibly more fun than actually playing &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games.” The second is the Toolbox, an online repository of 3D objects reminiscent of asset stores that exist for other &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fassetstore.unity.com%2Fsummer-sale%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAjwuIWHBhBDEiwACXQYsUDvJpbpxsbuBKJQj1ISdkZNHrmQW9XbvBhOhvgw8Jb6s3ZC2eHWORoC0o8QAvD_BwE&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;game engines&lt;/a&gt;. However, the models, meshes, and sky boxes available to download are often half-finished or long out of date and likely given strange, random names by the under-16s who primarily create and upload them. For Pipkin, this “chaotic nature” is all part of the charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRXl82GtpqxPWuMshMefJIN6fHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717872/Breezy_Bay_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lPkYPN"&gt;Having been updated incrementally over the years, Roblox Studio has become a robust piece of software in its own right, stacked with enough features for Pipkin to render these whimsical nighttime visions. They’re explicitly poetic, a tonal far cry from Cavanagh’s &lt;em&gt;Climb the Giant Man Obby,&lt;/em&gt; which leans into the silliness found on much of the platform. Pipkin’s “It’s Time” is about conversing with a hand-drawn mythological creature in a garden overgrown with pink cherry blossoms. It turns out that you and this creature are in a relationship and that your partner doesn’t have much longer to live; the game involves spending a final few minutes together. Pipkin explains that achieving the pencil aesthetic wasn’t all that difficult — illustrations can be imported straightforwardly enough — but creating a dialogue tree to fit the aesthetic was more challenging. The dialogue UI &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;comes with is locked so the artist had to hardcode their own. Pipkin describes this as one of Roblox Studio’s “weird edges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGS9bu"&gt;What’s lovely about “It’s Time,” as well as the rest of &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;, is how it makes no demands on you, unlike the platform more generally, which is sustained by microtransactions. It’s certainly not unique in this respect; one can look to many other uncommercialized worlds, such as the similarly beautiful &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F3158922185%2FToyokawa-Inari-Shrine-Showcase%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toyokawa Inari Shrine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe it’s the scope, or perhaps it’s Pipkin’s own ideological convictions, but this sensibility feels central to &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary&lt;/em&gt;. You explore &lt;em&gt;Dream Diary’s &lt;/em&gt;connected, haiku-like worlds for a few minutes — an industrial labyrinth, a humid forest, a grand spherical palace — before moving on with your day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrzkim"&gt;The upcoming &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F6593038276%2FBreezy-Bay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sits at what could be considered the opposite end of the creative spectrum. Its developer, Tailwind, one of the growing number of professional &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; studios, describes the game as “&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;Runescape&lt;/em&gt; for the TikTok generation,” which sounds exactly like a meta-tag written by someone in pursuit of the platform’s next big hit. In reality, this means it’s a social sandbox RPG centered on gathering resources and decorating an island (so far, so &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;) with a plethora of in-app purchases. However, the UK-based Tailwind, backed by &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-06-29-talewinds-plan-to-become-the-supercell-of-roblox"&gt;£800,000&lt;/a&gt; in venture capital money, has a few trip tricks up its sleeve, which co-founder Mike Allender says could help &lt;em&gt;Breezy Bay&lt;/em&gt; stand out not just in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; but the wider world of video games when it’s released this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40oXTI"&gt;Each island has elemental deities (earth, water, fire, etc.), and depending on your behavior, you’ll either please or anger them. As this happens, the island transforms topographically. Some will end up as Mordor-like archipelagos filled with lava and smitheries; others will become lush waterfall-filled spaces. There’s a planned social element, too. If players on a server work together and decide to venerate one deity, this could trigger server-wide bonuses; groups loyal to the water god could enjoy the company of a giant oceanic monster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U6OWiiyh4S26MS8oJpWIDAGMk0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717880/13unknown.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dream Diary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XWvteH"&gt;Formed in January this year, Tailwind currently has eight full-time employees and is pursuing what Allender calls a “hybrid” studio approach, incorporating traditional game developers and “&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;-native talent.” Their latest hire is an 18-year-old &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; developer who Allender says is “running circles around” older members of the team. However, Tailwind is still primarily made up of traditional developers, and Allender, who cut his teeth on &lt;em&gt;Runescape&lt;/em&gt; before moving to Jagex, is all too aware of the risks involved in approaching &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; as an outsider. “You can’t come in thinking you’re better than anyone else on the platform because you’ve made games for 15 years,” he says. “You’ve got to stay humble and respect what’s working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xhsyeE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’ve got to stay humble and respect what’s working.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4O4Wx9"&gt;Of course, &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just being pushed to its limits by newcomers to the platformer; it has its own thriving scene of cutting-edge games. Some of my recent favorites belong to the burgeoning genre of “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hmpwG_DzaY"&gt;vibe&lt;/a&gt;” games where players simply hang out in aesthetically striking spaces. (Many are reminiscent of Pipkin’s work, but more socially oriented and with a greater fondness for vaporwave.) There are even experiences that resemble the art video games of the 2010s. One of these is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F378223328%2FCONE%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a surreal platform-puzzle game that puts you in the role of a sentient traffic cone who embarks on a journey across a series of beautifully rendered spaces. It’s slow, meditative, and strikingly different to anything else I’ve played on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I99aph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone’s &lt;/em&gt;maker, Josh Sheldon, known on &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;as &lt;a href="https://roblox.fandom.com/wiki/Community:Defaultio"&gt;Defaultio&lt;/a&gt;, has been developing games for the platform since 2007 when he was 12 years old. He describes the game as a strange project, and not just because of the bizarre premise. It’s both the most conventional video game he could have made — a narrative-driven, single-player title — and a distinctly unconventional experience for the always-online &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Cone &lt;/em&gt;actually&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;represents something of a break from Sheldon’s usual work, which tends toward the more established &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; genres. His biggest hit,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roblox.com%2Fgames%2F13822889%2FLumber-Tycoon-2%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22577600%2Froblox-game-developers-artists" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lumber Tycoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has racked up 802 million visits from players keen to deforest their virtual surroundings. However, it’s Sheldon’s latest game, secretly referred to as “Test2’’ and “Projoot” on the internet, that’s most tantalizing — essentially an entire MMO built within &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; that operates at a scale to match the genre’s big hitters, in &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;or otherwise. Oh, and it’s got a boating mechanic that seems to capture the spirit of the Nintendo classic, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP42wusaHJI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf7NAC"&gt;Sheldon says he’s attempting something many have thought about with &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; but no one’s yet achieved (to the best of his knowledge). His “large-scale, cross-server game” allows players to simultaneously “teleport into servers” as they traverse the vast in-game space. What this means is that players sailing across the ocean load into new, persistent servers naturally. The meat of the game is open-ended but focuses on players gathering resources and building abodes, either on their own or communally. Entire towns have sprouted up organically, each with fluctuating property dynamics. (Sheldon says one has been “gentrified.”) Some have even organized their own political election. These are all outcomes of Sheldon’s design philosophy that hinges on simply giving players enough tools to engage with the game in a rich way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aGhU9ODurCl9rdODod1gDIBvfMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717881/Cone2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TBFu0N"&gt;When I ask Sheldon how he feels about outsiders migrating to the platform, he describes it as “awesome” and “absolutely inevitable” because of both the strength of the platform’s tools and the opportunities that increasingly exist on it. But for those game makers looking to professionalize their work, there’s one big caveat: &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; remunerates developers at the inverse rate of how video game stores tend to operate. Rather than taking home 70 percent of each transaction as they might on Steam, content creators actually see just 27 percent. There’s also the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, despite being publicly listed on the stock exchange with a valuation of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/03/11/roblox-ipo/"&gt;$41 billion&lt;/a&gt; in March this year, isn’t yet profitable. It reported a net loss of $253 million in 2020 alongside further losses of $97.2 million and $86 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBFqCw"&gt;While outsider game makers migrating to the platform won’t likely impact the fortunes of the company in the long run (unless, say, Hideo Kojima joins the party), such curiosity could yet spark interesting results that reverberate beyond it. One only need listen to Ricky Haggett, whose credits include cult video game hits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/15/20861155/wilmots-warehouse-review-puzzle-game-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wilmot’s Warehouse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991741/hohokum-ghostly-international"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hohokum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;em&gt;I Am Dead&lt;/em&gt;, for one possible peek at the ways &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;’s seamless multiplayer components might impact video games more broadly. “Our new game has definitely been influenced by playing a lot of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;,” he says. “It’s been such a good expression of faff-free hanging out with friends in a pandemic. There’s almost no barriers to entry — &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;feels frictionless.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SYIkv7"&gt;This is perhaps &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; most enticing offer to game makers: online infrastructure that can accommodate either many players or just a handful, in games that encompass everything from gigantic commercial projects to small, meditative titles. For Pipkin, it’s precisely these social elements that make the platform special. “Regardless of the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; itself is a company whose goals sit somewhere between laudable and questionable, people find a way to make meaningful spaces and interactions with one another inside of it, and they do so with vigor and abundance,” says Pipkin. “It’s compelling to be a part of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
