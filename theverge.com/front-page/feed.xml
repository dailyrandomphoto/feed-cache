    <title>Apple’s head of comms is leaving after less than a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tFaT8eBJvboBnGos5OGy4bVUSq4=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413485/1236193236.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dedh8I"&gt;Apple is renowned for a culture of secrecy, one that’s managed in no small part by the company’s head of communications. But it’s had a hard time filling that role, with the most recent entrant — &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-taps-stella-low-as-new-communications-chief"&gt;Stella Low, formerly Cisco’s PR chief&lt;/a&gt; — now leaving after less than a year on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zjgpi"&gt;Fifteen-year Apple vet Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261"&gt;according to journalist Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-new-head-of-pr-kristin-huguet?d_id=3072577&amp;amp;ref=bftwfwd&amp;amp;utm_source=dynamic&amp;amp;utm_campaign=bftwfwd"&gt;BuzzFeed’s John Paczkowski&lt;/a&gt;. Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed&lt;/em&gt; that she’s been promoted effective immediately, as Low leaves to spend more time with her family. The previous comms boss, Steve Dowling, left in September 2019, and Apple left the role open for nearly two years before hiring Low last May. (During that time, long-time Apple marketing and App Store boss Phil Schiller reportedly stood in.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e5v1V2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Longtime &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; PR exec (15 years) Kristin Huguet Quayle is taking over as VP, Worldwide Comms of the world’s most valuable company, a very big job given all the regulatory issues, products to come (hello AR glasses &amp;amp; autonomous cars) and the metaverseness of it all.&lt;/p&gt;— Kara Swisher (@karaswisher) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karaswisher/status/1484240198758240261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kBYobq"&gt;Between Dowling and Low, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;Apple became the world’s most valuable publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, got itself into the (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893546/epic-apple-fortnite-appeal-app-store-restrictions"&gt;ongoing&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and became embroiled in all kinds of scrutiny from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/9/11/20859972/apple-antitrust-app-store-search-tax-warren"&gt;antitrust enforcers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;developers&lt;/a&gt;, and its own employees — the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;could maybe bring its fortress of secrecy toppling down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUkbSl"&gt;Apple’s PR chief before that, Katie Cotton, set the tone for the company’s communications for 18 years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794104/apple-is-reportedly-looking-for-a-friendlier-head-of-public-relations"&gt;Apple was reportedly looking for a “friendlier, more approachable” successor&lt;/a&gt; after she left. I’m curious if the company’s relationship with the press will change again now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is available once again at Best Buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oz0oKj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 20th, 2:58PM EST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsAG7xlDGh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $399.99&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; has also gone up for sale at Best Buy. We have updated the copy and product cards in this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qSyWWO"&gt;While there have been many restocks of Sony’s PlayStation 5 console as it slowly gets a little easier to obtain one, we’re sadly not out of the woods just yet. The PS5 is still hard to come by for a product that is over one year old. Thankfully, there’s another chance to pick one up today, care of Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldz2XY"&gt;Best Buy is opening up orders for the standard disc drive-equipped &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgcljGhDR4o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 console, costing $499.99&lt;/a&gt; and disc-less &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsAG7xlDGh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Digital Edition for $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. Orders from Best Buy are usually based around store pickup orders, so it is very likely that you may need some luck on your side with a nearby location that has inventory. Whatever the case, the key is to try and stay persistent. Log into your Best Buy account, with billing and shipping info pre-filled, and click “Add to Cart” to join the queue. Once it is your turn the button may change and prompt you to verify your account. It’s after that point that you may find out whether a nearby store has stock or not. If not, you it doesn’t hurt to close the window and try again. Sometimes the stock for Best Buy stores is rolled out in waves, with restocks lasting up to, and sometimes over, one hour in length before everything is all sold out once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCzT2b"&gt;Hopefully you manage to get one today, but if not we’ll be here to let you know of the next restocks from Best Buy and other major retailers. If you did luck out, be sure to regularly check out our deals pages, where we often surface some of the best prices around on games and peripherals. You can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to our&lt;em&gt; Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;, and get deals and promos right to your inbox. accessories you may need right off the bat, and &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s woes continue as it temporarily halts bike, treadmill production</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pelton Bike Plus in an apartment" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ad9zwbqn1nOd5NA1J4npz7nUrws=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413318/akrales210108_4344_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QYgFlQ"&gt;Peloton’s pandemic fortunes began waning in 2021, and it appears that trend is continuing into the new year. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/peloton-to-pause-production-of-its-bikes-treadmills-as-demand-wanes.html"&gt;new CNBC report&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton has decided to temporarily halt production of its connected exercise bikes and treadmills amid weak consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5S442"&gt;Citing a confidential internal company presentation, CNBC reports that Peloton will stop producing its original Bike from February to March. The company halted production on its more premium Bike Plus in December and apparently has no plans to restart until at least June. The newer Peloton Tread, which launched last year, will also cease production for six weeks starting next month. Unsurprisingly, Peloton also reportedly has no plans to produce any Tread Plus machines in fiscal 2022. The company stopped making new Tread Plus machines after the Consumer Product Safety Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalled the device&lt;/a&gt; following reports of several injuries, and in one instance, the death of a small child. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvHY4f"&gt;The woes also extend to the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22771827/peloton-guide-camera-movement-tracking-price-release-date"&gt;Peloton Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Announced in November, the Guide was meant to be a $495 camera-based strength training system that connected with a user’s TV and came bundled with a heart-rate armband and a remote. However, CNBC cites internal documents showing the product hasn’t garnered a lot of interest thus far from consumers. While the Guide was expected to launch in early 2022, it appears that it may not launch until as late as April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQnm3e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Peloton for comment but did not immediately receive a response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2kFbY"&gt;The connected fitness company is purportedly halting production as it had overestimated consumer demand for its products and misjudged people’s desire to return to in-person fitness classes — a fact that CEO John Foley admitted during &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/events/event-details/peloton-interactive-1q22-earnings-call"&gt;its last investor call&lt;/a&gt; in November. The result is warehouses full of Peloton products, and no sign of another at-home fitness craze starting up on the horizon. It’s an ironic twist of fate. In the early days of the pandemic, Peloton’s biggest problem was its struggle to meet skyrocketing demand, resulting in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/business/peloton-slow-delivery.html"&gt;months-long shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;spent millions to address&lt;/a&gt;. Another issue is that Peloton went on a massive spending spree while things were going well. In December 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/maybe-now-peloton-orders-wont-take-so-long-1845933064"&gt;forked over $420 million&lt;/a&gt; to buy commercial fitness equipment maker Precor. It then spent another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451515/peloton-400-million-factory-ohio-treadmill-bikes"&gt;$400 million to build a factory in Ohio&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAkYki"&gt;It might be tempting to look at Peloton’s struggles as a bellwether for the entire connected fitness industry — and it’s undoubtedly true that many connected fitness equipment makers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22778851/peloton-growing-pains-connected-fitness-tonal-hydrow-mirror"&gt;have followed Peloton’s playbook&lt;/a&gt;. However, connected fitness isn’t going anywhere. Experts believe that akin to remote work, people will likely adopt &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/health/online-fitness-training-in-person-workouts-wellness/index.html"&gt;a hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; of working out both at home and in the gym. Peloton, while still the leader, is facing increased &lt;a href="https://www.modernretail.co/startups/at-home-fitness-brands-are-investing-more-in-marketing-as-competition-heats-up/"&gt;competition from rivals&lt;/a&gt; like Tonal, Echelon, Hydrow, and Mirror. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIa9lw"&gt;The bigger question is how Peloton adjusts to the new post-pandemic reality. Peloton’s next earnings call is scheduled for February 8th, but the results from last quarter were concerning. Although Peloton &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4e16bcc7-dd3b-40ec-acb6-840e691b40ee"&gt;retained 92 percent of its yearly subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, it reported a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/04/peloton-pton-to-report-fiscal-q1-2022-earnings-.html"&gt;net loss of $376 million&lt;/a&gt;. Attempts to slash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;$400 off the price&lt;/a&gt; of the original Peloton Bike in August didn’t seem to help bolster demand, either. A separate CNBC report from earlier this week also noted Peloton was working with a consulting firm &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/peloton-hires-mckinsey-to-review-cost-structure-as-equipment-sales-slow-.html"&gt;to potentially cut jobs&lt;/a&gt; and “review its cost structure,” as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/peloton-is-about-to-tack-on-hundreds-of-dollars-in-fees-to-its-bike-and-treadmill-citing-inflation.html"&gt;add delivery and assembly fees&lt;/a&gt; for its bikes and treadmills. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic pushes to overturn App Store ruling in opening appeal brief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfiBnPuc2aWphDwXvOUKu6dKoKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413310/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dzTaud"&gt;Epic Games has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182876-epic-appeal-opening-brief"&gt;its opening brief&lt;/a&gt; to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, seeking to overturn the previous ruling that Apple’s control over the iOS App Store does not qualify as a monopoly. The company first gave notice of it appeal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670269/epic-files-appeal-fortnite-legal-battle"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, but Thursday’s filing is the first time it has laid out its argument at length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123RE"&gt;“Epic proved at trial that Apple retrains trade...by contractually requiring developers to exclusively use Apple’s App Store to distribute apps and Apple’s IAP for payments for digital content within apps,” the filing reads. “If not overturned, [the district court] decision would upend established principles of antitrust law and...undermine sound antitrust policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAcyoS"&gt;Epic’s first legal challenge to Apple’s App Store restrictions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;came to a finish in September&lt;/a&gt;, when a district court ordered Apple to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;roll back some restrictions on in-app payments&lt;/a&gt;, but otherwise cleared the company of antitrust charges. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;A separate appeal from Apple&lt;/a&gt; has been filed to reverse the new in-app payment rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KICvp"&gt;In her ruling, Judge Gonzales Rogers was particularly ambiguous on the question of whether Apple held monopoly power over the mobile gaming market. “The evidence does suggest that Apple is near the precipice of substantial market power, or monopoly power, with its considerable market share,” she wrote in the decision. “Apple is only saved by the fact that its share is not higher, that competitors from related submarkets are making inroads into the mobile gaming submarket, and, perhaps, because [Epic] did not focus on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0wyxZ"&gt;In the appeals brief, Epic seems determined to revisit that question, and draw a clearer link between the iPhone’s success as a mobile gaming platform and a potential monopoly case against Apple. “The district court’s factual findings make clear,”  the filing alleges, “that Apple’s conduct is precisely what the antitrust laws prohibit.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lawmakers approve Big Tech antitrust overhaul, but with strings attached </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Majority Leader Schumer, Senate Democrats Hold Media Availability" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5LOnKFMStlcTi6Zsc1vNy0Kx4k=/0x0:4229x2819/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413292/1365492770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6KWLe4"&gt;Congress is one step closer to actualizing transformative antitrust reform for the tech industry after sending their most viable bill to the Senate floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2RgcH"&gt;The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the American Innovation and Choice Online Act by a 16-6 vote on Thursday after hours of lengthy debate. The bill – sponsored by a bipartisan group of tech hawks like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Josh Hawley (R-MO) – would ban dominant tech platforms from favoring their own services and products over those of their competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMEP4N"&gt;The successful committee vote comes after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889579/ftc-justice-department-lina-khan-kanter-google-facebook-amazon-antitrust"&gt;a week of antitrust action from the federal government&lt;/a&gt; that’s spooked the tech industry and put lobbyists in a frenzy. While prohibiting self-preferencing, like Amazon placing its own branded products above better-rated competing ones, the bill also forces platforms to apply their terms of service equally to every user. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dCrMi"&gt;Despite the committee’s successful vote, the bill faces an uphill battle over the months ahead. In the days leading up to the vote, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22890100/antitrust-bill-apple-google-big-tech-senate"&gt;Apple and Google brandished statements&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the legislation, mounting an industry-led assault against the bill. Tim Powderly, Apple’s senior director of government affairs, warned that the bill could harm consumer privacy and security, while Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, argued that it would make the company’s search engine far less useful to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ozFL"&gt;Specifically, Apple’s security concerns relate to language in the bill that the company fears would allow iPhone and iPad users to download apps outside of the App Store. Powderly argued this provision could harm users who could download unscreened and potentially harmful software to their devices. If enacted, the bill would make it difficult for Apple to collect its sometimes 30 percent commissions from developers on App Store purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BUWwnU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I want to stress that this bill is not meant to break up Big Tech or destroy the products and services they offer.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWj0Rx"&gt;Tech-backed industry groups, like NetChoice, echoed these concerns, saying that the vote came too quickly and didn’t give lawmakers enough time to fully understand the bill’s language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDEOXn"&gt;“Lawmakers should stop this backroom wheeling-and-dealing and instead take the input of economists, experts, and businesses to better understand the impact of this rushed legislation,” Carl Szabo, NetChoice’s vice president and general counsel, said in a statement after Thursday’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RD6OIi"&gt;The bill’s sponsors tried to smooth over concerns from the industry and their colleagues over the legislation. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) said in his opening remarks, “I want to stress that this bill is not meant to break up Big Tech or destroy the products and services they offer.” He continued, “Rather, the goal of the bill is to prevent conduct that stifles competition, while ensuring that pro-consumer innovations and offerings are still available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pUg9lZ"&gt;During the hearing, senators on both sides of the aisle proposed amendments to address additional concerns over privacy, censorship, and national security. Specifically, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) said that he had several amendments, including language that would allow users to sue platforms they accuse of harming them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBCHJd"&gt;“The abuses of Big Tech are such that I am happy to unleash the trial lawyers,” Cruz said during Thursday’s markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCGm3Z"&gt;Cruz did not offer up any of the amendments, saying that Klobuchar and the bill’s sponsors are working with him to include this language in the final bill text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zGBIF"&gt;Progressive groups, &lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/provision-senate-antitrust-bill-would-undermine-fight-against-online-hate-and-disinformation"&gt;like Free Press&lt;/a&gt;, raised separate concerns, suggesting that a certain provision could make it harder for platforms like Facebook and Google to tackle disinformation or deplatform hateful or racist users and publications like the &lt;em&gt;Daily Stormer&lt;/em&gt;, a white supremacist website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE72cl"&gt;“This provision could require platforms to host hate speech and other harmful content targeting Black and Brown people, the LGBTQIA+ community, women, immigrants, Indigenous people and other targeted populations,” Free Press said in a statement on Thursday. “It opens the door to arguments that covered platforms are unlawfully discriminating against hate-and-disinformation purveyors by taking them down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54nmZC"&gt;Last summer, the House Judiciary Committee passed a similar bill to the one the Senate approved on Thursday. Still, that bill has yet to receive a vote on the House floor and must be approved by both chambers of Congress before it heads to President Biden’s desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhftrW"&gt;The White House hasn’t issued any statements in support of the legislation, but &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/readout-of-listening-session-on-addressing-barriers-to-competition-and-innovation-in-tech/"&gt;administration officials met&lt;/a&gt; with the leaders of companies that have criticized Big Tech in the past, like Sonos and Yelp, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbD6CG"&gt;“Participants explained the challenges their businesses encounter operating through third-party platforms to reach large numbers of customers,” a readout from the meeting said. “A number of participants also expressed difficulty paying both fees that platforms charge and indirect costs through requiring the purchasing of supplemental services or advertising to maintain the business user’s position in platforms’ rankings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nceqsB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1P0Z2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter brings NFTs to the timeline as hexagon-shaped profile pictures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter NFT profile pictures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YEFh1Ul4rSgI6PGU7Y1NnVIRDeI=/66x0:1292x817/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413202/twitter_nft_hex.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter NFT profile pictures&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WEXJy"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689806/twitter-bitcoin-lightning-tipping-nft-authentication"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would add a way for users to authenticate non-fungible tokens (NFT), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273"&gt;now the feature is live&lt;/a&gt; — if you pay for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;$2.99 Twitter Blue subscription&lt;/a&gt; and are using an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jaqDlppdRPR0r8e0kb-WjRJ-wZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182610/twitter_nft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter animation showing the transition from regular profile picture to NFT-enabled soft hexagon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZyHXf9prLN8HoXNRjLlgpxxtpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182589/twitter_nft_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv2qfL"&gt;On one hand, NFT profile pictures could be viewed as an incredible technology integration adding real utility for verified digital items. Alternately, it’s an unmissable signal pointing out the people that you should block or mute before they try to sell you some of their blockchain receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWXuT"&gt;No matter what your opinion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;easily reproduced&lt;/a&gt; digital trinkets is, Twitter is integrating them in a way that separates ridiculous images of cartoon apes that have been right-clicked from ridiculous images of cartoon apes that are connected to blockchain tokens by adding a special “soft hexagon” shape around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwtH4B"&gt;At launch, Twitter is supporting several crypto wallets that users can connect to their profiles and verify that their tokens are of the no-fungible variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="la8n6r"&gt;Argent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w7DhB0"&gt;Coinbase Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ld2BLx"&gt;Ledger Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yGHwCU"&gt;MetaMask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sfF0Mi"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2obJCp"&gt;Trust Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oh8au7"&gt;However, one side effect of limiting its interaction with the blockchain to a list of approved sources means that information on who owns what is not as decentralized as you may think. As researcher Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1484191510455533569?s=21"&gt;noted earlier Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, a database outage &lt;a href="https://status.opensea.io/incidents/88862t31ybw5"&gt;that knocked the OpenSea API offline for a few hours&lt;/a&gt; caused Twitter’s NFT collection pages to lose their information too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DIU8cn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbC9Zv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs#nft"&gt;This FAQ explains the process&lt;/a&gt; (while trying to make sure NFT owners avoid clicking a phishing link instead of Twitter’s official ones, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks"&gt;an all-too-frequent vector for NFT theft&lt;/a&gt;), and answers the question of what happens if you sell the NFT that’s in your picture. As it turns out, Twitter will continue to display the image, regardless of what the blockchain has to say about who owns it, however, it will revert to a common circle frame instead of the special crypto wallet-only hexagon shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw6djT"&gt;If you see someone flashing one of these images and need to know more about their items, you can click on the hexagon profile pic. select ViewNFT details and find out information about the “NFT owner, NFT description, collection, properties, and additional details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQLPK4"&gt;

Follow these simple steps to connect your crypto wallet and let’s see your NFT PFPs! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epSL7VXG5o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epSL7VXG5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226540984356864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>TikTok marketing lead behind its NFTs and ghost kitchens no longer at the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9S5LZrrL9hiP6fKz-ckSa56V7_U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413192/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TikTok has had some... interesting marketing campaigns recently.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vD606Q"&gt;Nick Tran is no longer TikTok’s global head of marketing, reportedly because the company was unimpressed with his “side-show” marketing campaigns, &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/19/tiktoks-marketing-chief-ousted-after-going-rogue-with-bizarre-campaigns/?utm_campaign=iphone_nyp&amp;amp;amp;utm_source=twitter_app"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the most notable “stunt-marketing” schemes he came up with included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845154/tiktok-kitchens-viral-food-ghost-kitchens"&gt;opening TikTok Kitchens&lt;/a&gt;, letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567220/tiktok-resumes-job-application"&gt;apply to jobs  at places like Chipotle or Target&lt;/a&gt; via TikToks, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702871/lil-nas-x-tiktok-top-moments-nfts-auction"&gt;NFT collaboration&lt;/a&gt; with celebrities like Lil’ Nas X and Bella Poarch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URrPoo"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;reports that the restaurant campaign, where ghost kitchens would cook and deliver recipes that went viral on TikTok, was the one of the last straws for Tran. “We’re not in the restaurant business and we shouldn’t pretend to be,” one executive reportedly said. Looking at some of the campaigns, it is a bit difficult to find a connection to TikTok’s actual business of hosting short form videos, or how they work to boost its image (apart from possibly just getting people to talk about TikTok at all, though it’s not like there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tiktok"&gt;been a drought of TikTok news&lt;/a&gt; in the two-ish years that Tran worked there). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ML9dVY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TikTok also had traditional ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1EFJcV"&gt;Not all of TikTok’s recent ads have been so tangentially related though. I genuinely enjoyed one of its &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/10/19/ad-the-day-tiktok-s-you-have-see-it-retells-shocking-story-hidden-apartment"&gt;“you have to see it” ads&lt;/a&gt;, which shows people (including Martha Stewart) talking about &lt;a href="https://www.curbed.com/2021/03/nyc-apartment-tiktok-bathroom-mirror-viral.html"&gt;that series of TikToks where someone found an entire apartment behind their bathroom mirror&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYHKMV"&gt;Tran worked at Hulu before being poached by TikTok. According a 2020 profile in &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/40-under-40/2020/nick-tran/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;’s 40 under 40&lt;/a&gt;, he worked on a few strange ad campaigns there as well — he was involved with Hulu’s Super Bowl ad which used an egg to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/4/18209773/world-record-egg-instagram-hulu-super-bowl-ad-mental-health"&gt;tell people to “talk to someone” if they were struggling with mental health&lt;/a&gt;, capitalizing off the egg picture that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/14/18181806/instagram-most-liked-post-egg-kylie-jenner"&gt;became the most-liked post on Instagram at the time&lt;/a&gt;. The ad doesn’t heavily feature Hulu branding, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208265/hulu-world-record-egg-instagram-superbowl-ad-sponsorship"&gt;made a big deal about sponsoring the egg&lt;/a&gt; in the run-up to the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNWwFo"&gt;Tran also led an ad campaign called “Better ruins everything,” where &lt;a href="https://www.thedrum.com/creative-works/project/big-family-table-hulu-better-ruins-everything"&gt;a variety of celebrities tell you not to buy Hulu&lt;/a&gt; (it’s not quite like Patagonia &lt;a href="https://bettermarketing.pub/dont-buy-this-jacket-patagonia-s-daring-campaign-2b37e145046b"&gt;telling you not to buy their jacket&lt;/a&gt;, the celebrities are warning you that Hulu is so much better than TV that you’ll never be able to go without it after you use it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g0oRZ"&gt;While Tran’s marketing stunts may have only vaguely related to TikTok, that’s not particularly abnormal for marketing these days — did seeing a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSeBuY9F2hE"&gt;baby version of Mr. Peanut&lt;/a&gt; make you hungry? Did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/12/22227043/swedish-metal-band-lenovo-legion-5i-review"&gt;seeing a heavy metal band growl-scream out an excerpt from one of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s reviews&lt;/a&gt; make you want to buy a Lenovo laptop? (Okay, that one was actually pretty awesome.) TikTok didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but confirmed Tran’s departure in &lt;a href="https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/nick-tran-out-tiktok-global-marketing-chief/2393601"&gt;a statement to &lt;em&gt;Ad Age&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (though, as a note, he does list Global Head of Marketing at TikTok as his current job on LinkedIn). TikTok’s statement wished him well in his future endeavors — whatever they end up being, we’ll probably hear about them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Neuralink is hiring a clinical trial director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhQOTcc3R61JWW5bHXxO-AF56hY=/0x86:4978x3405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413014/1234657348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Musk says trials should start this year.  | Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ouhXKq"&gt;Elon Musk’s brain-machine interface company Neuralink has a new &lt;a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/neuralink/jobs/4723041003"&gt;job posting&lt;/a&gt; for a clinical trial director, a position that could help the company move towards its stated goal of testing its brain implant in actual people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQJVdc"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/27/15077864/elon-musk-neuralink-brain-computer-interface-ai-cyborgs"&gt;launching publicly in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Neuralink has demoed its brain implant in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;pigs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374749/elon-musk-neuralink-monkey-pong-brain-interface"&gt;monkeys&lt;/a&gt; but has yet to announce a start to the long-promised trials in humans. The company’s implant is a coin-like device with electrodes studded on thin, flexible wires. The wires are its main innovation over older brain-machine interfaces, which use stiffer needles that can damage cells in the brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRPM5W"&gt;The company needs to do trials in humans before it can get Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for general medical use — key for Musk’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;stated plan&lt;/a&gt; to use the devices to solve a number of neurological problems, from memory loss to addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2WCP7"&gt;The clinical trial director job posting, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/elon-musk-s-brain-implant-company-is-inching-toward-human-trials?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, says that the person in the role will be “working with Neuralink’s first Clinical Trial participants,” though it’s not clear if the company has started recruiting or working with participants at this point. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/elon-musk-sees-neuralink-implants-for-2022-says-ceo-is-a-made-up-title/"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt; in December that the company aims to have the device implanted in the first human subjects in 2022. That’s not the first prediction he’s made, though — Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; he hoped to start trials in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkwpyt"&gt;The clinical trial process would start with a feasibility study to get a first look at how the device works in a small number of people. Then, because the device is high-risk and hasn’t been previously used in people, the company would need FDA approval to launch a larger-scale trial. According to the job posting, the clinical trial director would be responsible for interactions with regulators like the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzqxr0"&gt;The person who takes the clinical trials director position will enter a scientific environment that ex-employees &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/08/25/elon-musk-neuralink-update-brain-machine-implants/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 was chaotic and was characterized by pressure to deliver scientific progress on unreasonably short timelines. They’d have to handle Musk’s consistent promises of timelines that haven’t previously panned out and his publicly-stated ambitions that still go beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493224/elon-musk-neuralink-neuroscience-brain-machine"&gt;what scientists say are reasonable expectations&lt;/a&gt; for brain-machine interfaces. None of that is in the job description. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqp7DJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGr6xr"&gt;Every year, the cost of streaming gets more and more expensive — and just last week, prices started going up again. Netflix announced that all of its tiers would get an immediate price hike for new subscribers, boosting its most expensive plan to $20 per month. It’s the third price increase since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8oF40"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926"&gt;$15.50 per month&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s standard tier now slightly out-prices HBO Max ($15 per month) and the Disney Bundle (which includes ESPN Plus and Hulu for $14 per month), making it one of the most expensive on-demand streaming options among leading services. If you want 4K, it gets even pricier. That’s not an insignificant amount of money, considering people tend to have around four paid streaming subscriptions, according to &lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/press-releases/media-companies-strive-to-retain-subscribers-but-consumers-still-crave-social-connections-not-just-entertainment.html"&gt;recent data&lt;/a&gt; from Deloitte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aToYzv"&gt;While the price hikes sting for consumers, it’s safe to expect they’ll continue — especially for Netflix. Growth opportunities have stalled, and the company’s spending on content continues to grow. To keep up, Netflix has to either increase the number of subscribers paying for its service or ask its existing customers for more money. And right now, Netflix knows it can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyAkK2"&gt;“They’re doing pretty well, but they’re going to continue to tighten up their finances as time goes by,” Parks Associates senior analyst Paul Erickson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the fundamental way in which they do that — small incremental price changes over time. Because they feel they are so well entrenched, and their customers are loyal, they feel that it’s not going to materially affect their subscribership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o2wFu5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The money has to come from somewhere.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WhVc2O"&gt;One of the big reasons Netflix needs money is to pay for new shows and movies. Streaming services are spending a frankly outrageous chunk of change on original programming, with global spend expected to exceed $230 billion in 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/press/release/dl/content-spend-sees-double-digit-growth-and-reaches-220-billion-in-2021-driven-by-svod-se"&gt;according to estimates&lt;/a&gt; from firm Ampere Analysis. Ampere positions Netflix as the third-largest investor in video content, surpassed only by Disney and Comcast — both of which the firm notes invest in pricey sports rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jiGOd"&gt;By dumping truckloads of money in original programming, streamers hope to not only hang onto their existing customers but lure in new subscribers as well. For Netflix, expanding its programming across genres and categories helps it be everything to everyone. Investing in an ever-growing portfolio of scripted, unscripted, animated, and live-action programming helps ensure that Netflix remains a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLhgMt"&gt;“The more that they can serve all the different aspects of different households — whether that’s language specificity, if it’s market and lifestyle specificity — the better,” Erickson says. This allows Netflix to justify positioning itself as a core, must-have entertainment service. And if its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;200 million-plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; are any indication, the strategy is working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcL2nR"&gt;&lt;div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/8478791"&gt;&lt;script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iTmEnU"&gt;But there’s another reason Netflix has turned to price increases to raise more money. Even with its hundreds of millions of &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-automatically-canceling-inactive-accounts-1234613201/"&gt;active subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s subscriber growth &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394425/netflix-subscriber-growth-stalls-2021"&gt;has begun plateauing&lt;/a&gt;. The company continues to add subscribers, but the number of quarterly additions has dipped in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525428/netflix-earnings-q3-content-subscribers-pandemic-competition"&gt;recent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/netflix-q1-2021-media-earnings-1234955952/"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; (in some cases, even &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/netflix-q1-2021-subscribers-earnings-4165366/"&gt;falling below&lt;/a&gt; forecasted figures). Netflix’s content spend, meanwhile, only &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/964789/netflix-content-spend-worldwide/"&gt;continues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/blog/netflix-amortized-content-spend-estimated-at-13-6-billion-in-2021"&gt;to grow&lt;/a&gt;, with the company &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/netflix-2021-content-spend-17-billion-1234955953/"&gt;spending billions&lt;/a&gt; on programming every year. And with major competitors like Disney Plus and HBO Max entering the market, they’re only likely to keep growing so Netflix can remain competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3RZ0T"&gt;This is likely to come up in the company’s earnings call later today, as investors are worried about &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/netflix-stock-price-earnings-subscribers-51642625439?tesla=y"&gt;slowing subscriber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/nflx-q4-fy-2021-earnings-report-preview-5216333"&gt;revenue growth&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to paying for the content it needs to continue scaling its business, Netflix also has to keep its antsy investors happy as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PJnVAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you use Netflix every day, then you kind of don’t pay attention.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HRLxTD"&gt;Without taking the highly maligned step of simply kicking all of us off our exes or parents’ plans — Netflix boss Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325831/netflix-password-sharing-test-feature-piracy-security-streaming-video"&gt;has described&lt;/a&gt; shared accounts as “something you have to learn to live with” — Netflix has to figure out a way to counterbalance its debts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlis5r"&gt;“The money has to come from somewhere. A company can only pay off its debt and get to true profitability with hard cash,” Erickson says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrKNJg"&gt;At the same time, small incremental price increases every year and a half or so probably won’t impact subscriber turnover for a service that customers use often or one that’s central to their cord-cutting portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SD2mN"&gt;“Does the consumer feel that Netflix is a good value at the price? If the answer is yes, overwhelmingly they can raise prices and pretty much nobody quits,” Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you use Netflix every day, then you kind of don’t pay attention.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hXRBK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884263/netflix-price-increases-2021-us-canada-all-plans-hd-4k"&gt;Historic trends for price hikes&lt;/a&gt; offered a clue that another was coming for US subscribers sometime soon. Additionally, Netflix COO and chief product officer Greg Peters said during an &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;earnings call&lt;/a&gt; last year that by delivering what Netflix feels is “an amazing entertainment value” through content and user experience, the company can occasionally go back to its subscribers and “ask them to pay a little bit more to keep that positive cycle going.” In other words, a price increase was just as good as &lt;em&gt;promised&lt;/em&gt; by Netflix — but cracking the teens is still a pretty significant milestone for the streamer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uVRVZ"&gt;Setting aside the decade or so lead that Netflix has on its rivals for everything from viewing data to its catalog, pretty much every move Netflix makes is driven by making its streaming service as addictive as possible, which, again, costs money. Whether that’s expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-01-16/netflix-outlines-the-next-phase-of-its-sports-strategy"&gt;sports offerings&lt;/a&gt;, taking big swings with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822107/dont-look-up-review-netflix"&gt;both critically adored&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/introducing-the-emerging-filmmaker-initiative-to-support-new-voices-in-genre"&gt;up-and-coming directors&lt;/a&gt;, or expanding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22770244/netflix-gaming-app-launch-android-ios-future"&gt;characters and worlds with gaming&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix is burning through cash to try to keep you hooked on its service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myngGD"&gt;“They’re going to continue to innovate because now that they know they’ve got to weight in the industry, weight for original content creation — it’s not just a fluke,” Erickson says. “It’s proving to be viable for them to continue to diversify what they’re doing content-wise, even if it means going outside of the traditional volumes and types of content that they’re used to delivering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drKuBO"&gt;Netflix enjoys an arguably unrivaled brand loyalty in the streaming space — it’s &lt;em&gt;synonymous&lt;/em&gt; with streaming. At the end of the day, Netflix is cranking up its price by a buck or two every couple of years simply because it can. It’s safe to assume it’ll continue doing so, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC Mayor Adams will convert his city paycheck to cryptocurrency via Coinbase</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HSZAf9"&gt;Following through on a plan he announced before he took office, New York City Mayor Eric Adams &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/041-22/mayor-adams-receive-first-paycheck-cryptocurrency"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that his first paycheck, which arrives on Friday, will be converted from US dollars into cryptocurrency. The transaction will take place on Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and will convert Adams’ pay into Bitcoin and Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Kjuj"&gt;“New York is the center of the world, and we want it to be the center of cryptocurrency and other financial innovations,” Adams said in a statement. “Being on the forefront of such innovation will help us create jobs, improve our economy, and continue to be a magnet for talent from all over the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdJ0UU"&gt;Adams tweeted on November 4th that he would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764104/new-york-city-mayor-elect-eric-adams-announces-bitcoin-paycheck-miami"&gt;take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; when he became mayor because “In New York we always go big,” he noted. The idea was part of a back-and-forth with Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said in November he’d take his next paycheck in Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="huOvgd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In New York we always go big, so I’m going to take my first THREE paychecks in Bitcoin when I become mayor. NYC is going to be the center of the cryptocurrency industry and other fast-growing, innovative industries! Just wait!&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Adams (@ericadamsfornyc) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FTz5qd"&gt;US Department of Labor rules prohibit New York City from paying employees in cryptocurrency, however, hence the post-payment conversion on Coinbase. Suarez &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/miami-mayor-seeks-wider-crypto-use-after-taking-pay-in-bitcoin"&gt;reportedly converts his city salary into Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; using fintech exchange Strike. The two join a growing list of professional athletes— which includes Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers — &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-nfl-players-that-chose-crypto-over-cash-salaries"&gt;who take or convert their salaries in cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtRdT5"&gt;Both Suarez and Adams are pushing to make their respective cities DeFi hubs, with Suarez supporting crypto investments in the south Florida city and launching a &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/news+/130710/the-miamicoin-project-has-generated-22-5-million-for-the-city-now-comes-the-hard-part-using-it"&gt;token called MiamiCoin&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
