    <title>Just look at this amazing Pac-Man history book</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3tzbq6BnMi4WvcIurATOZNkvCA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732711/12_PACMAN_CE_overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJNUOg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; celebrated its 40th anniversary last year, and to commemorate the occasion, Cook and Becker is releasing a history book later this year — and it looks incredible. While there’s a standard hardcover version of the book for $39, which is called &lt;a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artwork/3012/pac-man-birth-of-an-icon-pac-man-bandai-namco.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you can also buy a $99 special edition that comes with an ingenious Pac-Man-shaped slipcase. There’s even a vinyl pressing of the single “Pac-Man Fever” included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5K1v9H"&gt;The book is described as “the first-ever official history book” for the iconic video games series, and it’s written by Arjan Terpstra and Tim Lapetino. Here’s the official description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bs0b3k"&gt;This new non-fiction narrative volume will journey from creator Toru Iwatani’s “pizza slice” inspiration to the game’s incredible success in arcades and beyond. The book also dives into Pac-Man’s unprecedented impact on pop culture, with more than 40 new interviews from key players around the world, behind-the-scenes stories, documents, images, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UZvSv"&gt;With untold stories, new details, and archival imagery, &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man: Birth of an Icon&lt;/em&gt; showcases the franchise’s complex history from Tokyo to Chicago to Boston, unpacking the stories of video game industry stalwarts Namco and Midway Manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wCiUwA"&gt;If the name Cook and Becker sounds familiar, it’s probably because of the company’s work releasing high-end art prints for games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974054/last-of-us-part-2-ps4-fine-art-prints-cook-and-becker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551618/ghost-of-tsushima-concept-art-prints-sale-pricing-sucker-punch-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with art books like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16762996/final-fantasy-15-art-design-book-cook-becker"&gt;a giant tome on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV’&lt;/em&gt;s creation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjTnS7"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; book is expected to release this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gives recent Pixel device owners more control over Night Sight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eLmMbA3lhDkA4q02KTyiuaCnMt8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732555/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 5 and 4A 5G (pictured) can enable Night Sight mode automatically.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iuJku3"&gt;Thanks to its latest update, the Google Camera app now lets you permanently turn off its Auto Night Sight feature on devices that automatically enable the low-light photography mode, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/27/pixel-5-auto-night-sight/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is available with version 8.1.200 of the app, which started rolling out on Monday. Additionally, the update lets you disable the mode from the app’s flash settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6otdHf"&gt;When Google released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; last year, it tweaked their camera apps to enable Night Sight mode automatically in low-light conditions. But using the feature means photos take longer to capture, so there’ll inevitably be occasions when you don’t want it to automatically come on. Annoyingly, as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, the toggle to turn this feature off (on the bottom right of the Camera app) would previously reset whenever the app closed. As of this latest update, Auto Night Sight now remains disabled when you close the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H1ehwj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5FuSLyvIx_Q?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2EwUw"&gt;As well as letting users permanently turn off Auto Night Sight, the latest version of the app also adds a Night Sight toggle into the app’s flash settings. The update doesn’t appear to be available for older Pixel phones, which prompt users to manually turn on Night Sight in low-light conditions rather than enabling it automatically. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp adds biometric authentication for logging in on desktop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5qmpGjkbbPOJoDOZKmcUoJoN9-g=/271x0:3201x1953/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732409/iOS_and_Android.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KIaWdB"&gt;Linking your WhatsApp account to your &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/web/download-and-installation/about-whatsapp-web-and-desktop/?lang=en"&gt;computer’s web browser&lt;/a&gt; or desktop app is getting a little more secure. Soon, if you’ve got biometric authentication enabled on your phone, you’ll have to unlock the app before you can link your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePJaU1"&gt;The company says the new system is intended to ensure that should someone else gain access to your phone, they won’t be able to link your account to their web browser (which, in turn, would allow them to see any messages you send or receive). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yi352l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To be clear: WhatsApp (and Facebook) aren’t getting access to your fingerprints or facial recognition scans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xlAMey"&gt;The new system will be enabled by default on any iPhone devices running iOS 14 with either Touch ID or Face ID, and any Android devices that have biometric authentication enabled. That means users will have to use it to link their accounts unless they disable biometric authentication for their entire device. Users who don’t have a biometric authentication setup on their phone (or have it turned off) will be able to link their account as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMC3xI"&gt;As with any other use of biometric security on modern smartphones, the new system does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean that WhatsApp is accessing or collecting your facial scans or fingerprints. Rather, it’s just using the same biometric data APIs every other app does in order to access the on-device security system as an extra measure of authentication before it allows users to connect their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aECT3T"&gt;So in the same way that using a fingerprint reader to log in to your banking app doesn’t grant Chase or Bank of America your fingerprint scans, using the new biometric unlock system here to link your account to your computer isn’t giving WhatsApp (or Facebook) your personal information either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncXRk7"&gt;WhatsApp says that the new update should be rolling out for compatible devices in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What if you could see even more tabs?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aygQlVv2d1TeKUjpb3yulQMkecM=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732407/2_line_tab_stack_hero_980x551.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XyeUec"&gt;Vivaldi is releasing version 3.6 of the Vivaldi browser with a great and terrible power today: you can now &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/press/vivaldi-browser-tabs-two-level/"&gt;create two-level tab stacks&lt;/a&gt;, so that grouped tabs can become pseudo-workspaces for whatever you get up to in your browser. Vivaldi first introduced the feature &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/desktop/two-level-tab-stacks-vivaldi-browser-snapshot-2130-3/"&gt;as an experiment&lt;/a&gt; in December 2020, but now you can officially indulge in two levels of too many tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SepBqy"&gt;Creating two-level stacked tabs is as easy as holding down the Command or Windows key, selecting whatever tabs you want to be in the stack, and then right-clicking and selecting “New Tab stack” from the drop down menu. You can also achieve the same effect by dragging and holding one tab over another. Clicking on the newly formed tab stack (signified with a white outline) reveals the second row of tabs nestled inside. Tab stacks can be renamed and closed all at once from the right-click drop down menu as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPApu0mWvVF0wyY0zDg3olbNPWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264435/2_line_tab_stack_side_by_side.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vivaldi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vivaldi’s two versions of stacked tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQOcBJ"&gt;With the two-level tab stack, each grouping can function as a visually distinct workspace for however many browser-based projects you might have going at once. It could be a way to silo distracting tabs in your window while keeping your tabs neat and preventing you from losing a page when you really need it. Or, could just be another way to hoard even more tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf9SmW"&gt;Vivaldi also lets you put tabs on the sides and the bottom of the browser window, and the new two-level tab feature works in those orientations, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLosqx"&gt;Vivaldi’s Chromium-based browser has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/6/11374806/walt-mossberg-vivaldi-web-browser-opera"&gt;angled towards power users&lt;/a&gt; since its inception. It’s highly customizable, full of features, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21137843/vivaldi-privacy-tools-private-network-browser-settings-security"&gt;seemingly pretty great when it comes to privacy&lt;/a&gt;. The browser even launched &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/vivaldi-the-four-browsers/"&gt;with tab grouping in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, something Google Chrome didn’t start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257446/google-chome-tab-grouping-feature"&gt;rolling out until 2020&lt;/a&gt;. And if you like tree-style tabs, which can “branch” off of and nest inside other tabs, Vivaldi has those, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88SIGx"&gt;For more information on all of Vivaldi’s tab-focused features &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/features/tab-management/"&gt;you can head here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’d like to try Vivaldi for yourself, you can download the browser from &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/"&gt;Vivaldi’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s profits rose in 2020 despite the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aHUnDzVgsWSW0gab7Iuf7bnTXBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732379/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fyUHE"&gt;Samsung Electronics has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2020-results"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its fourth-quarter earnings, confirming that the company made more money in 2020 than the year before despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit was up to 35.99 trillion won ($32.1 billion) off 236.81 trillion won ($211.5 billion) in revenue for the year, increases of 29.6 percent and 2.78 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEz8rU"&gt;Samsung says its fourth-quarter results were helped by its “company-wide efforts to ensure a stable supply of products and services globally” in the pandemic environment. Quarterly profit was up 26.4 percent year-on-year, largely driven by the display and memory businesses, though the latter was down quarter to quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ANV36K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1gqgzi"&gt;Samsung’s display business had its highest ever quarterly earnings, which the company mainly attributes to high demand from major smartphone manufacturers. (Samsung doesn’t spell it out, but this was the quarter that Apple outfitted its entire new iPhone 12 lineup with OLED panels.) Samsung also reduced its losses from larger displays like TVs and monitors, and calls out a greater demand for contactless services as a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb3f1d"&gt;Samsung expects mobile profit to increase this quarter thanks to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and says it plans to expand its lineup of foldable devices. The display division, meanwhile, expects OLED penetration to continue to increase throughout the smartphone market and beyond, with wider applications in laptops, tablets, and cars. The company will also pursue growth with foldable and slidable displays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the next iOS 14 beta with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to this spring, but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms to aid in advertising. Prior to the change, Apple let iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking, and mobile app companies can still personalize ads so long as they can disclose that with an App Store privacy label.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple says the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin says the Lily is ‘the smartwatch women have been waiting for’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Garmin’s Lily smartwatch on an actual person" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnxz84el2btm5xvu39Ue_aefspE=/1012x0:2440x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731969/02_pplonmove_ccfe7178_023b_4046_b131_b5b215ba7470.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg67RX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210127005158/en/Garmin-unveils-Lily-its-smalle%5B%E2%80%A6%5DYOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;Garmin has released a new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; called the Lily, and its main selling point is that Garmin claims it’s designed by women, for women. The Sport Edition, which is made of aluminum and has a silicone band, costs $199, while the stainless steel Classic Edition is $250 and comes with a leather band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBGECy"&gt;Garmin claims it’s “the smartwatch women have been waiting for,” which seems based on its size and design, which is very fashion-forward. However, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/garmin-lily-review-1193939/"&gt;as reviewer Lily Katz from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; in her review of the Lily, the watch may have given up a few important features to achieve those looks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAsFShxKppLGZEJ8KGanRoC0FWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264180/01_bigfeatures_8f6bca25_297f_4efd_9f35_2da35205fd8b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To its credit, the Lily looks very much like a regular watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HhjvT6"&gt;One of the Lily’s main selling points is that it’s small. It’s circular, with a diameter of 34.5mm, whereas the smaller 40mm Apple Watch SE is a 40mm by 34mm rectangle. Area-wise, that means the Apple Watch takes up 1,360 square millimeters on your wrist, while the Lily only takes 935. By my calculations, that means the Lily will cover 31 percent less of your wrist. It’s Garmin’s smallest smartwatch, and I’d imagine it’d look comically small next to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;the company’s rugged Fenix watches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2IXcP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXv3ruNvlv8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4JsKcy"&gt;The watch is circular, to look more like a “classic” non-smartwatch, and it has a patterned background. The screen is touch-sensitive, but monochromatic, which seems a bit lacking when similarly-priced offerings from Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung all have color screens. That said, it’s probably to help preserve battery life, as Garmin claims it should get up to five days, which is pretty impressive given its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDxPUi"&gt;If the watch’s band design is important to you, though, you may want to look elsewhere: the Lily’s straps are proprietary, and it doesn’t seem like Garmin is selling any more on its store yet. Additionally, you can’t mix and match bands — the colors are matched to the case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hy8RfexPt2d3LNQXEKXSXqfPKIM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264175/productfan_1591a957_7cb4_4966_a84d_123ed85cd272.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The different watch colors and editions also have different background lens designs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9WYzM"&gt;Garmin focuses a lot on fitness and wellness tracking with its smartwatches, and the Lily can track steps, workouts, sleep, stress levels, blood oxygen saturation, periods, and pregnancies. Of course, none of those things are unique to this smartwatch — most of Garmin’s other smartwatches feature the fitness tracking, and there are at least two others that feature the period and pregnancy tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLdtdC"&gt;This means you have to decide whether you like the Lily’s looks enough to make some trade-offs. The Lily doesn’t have GPS, offline music, or Garmin Pay built-in like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451145/garmin-venu-sq-music-edition-smartwatch-gps-spotify-nfc-wearable-blood-oxygen"&gt;Garmin’s own Venu Sq&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for the same price. There are also other $200-ish smartwatches from other brands that are more feature-rich than the Lily, but to some they may not look as nice. A smartwatch could have all the features in the world, but be totally useless if you find it too ugly to wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7Ke2n"&gt;There’s also not a lot of competing smartwatches that are as small as the Lily, so buyers concerned with having something take up the bulk of their wrist may also be interested. It’s just worth considering what features you’re willing to give up, and whether you’re willing to deal with some of &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/garmin-lily-review-1193939/"&gt;the other caveats reviewers have found&lt;/a&gt;. The watch is available now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F698519%2Fpn%2F010-02384-02&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F27%2F22253056%2Fgarmin-lily-smartwatch-designed-for-women-small#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from Garmin’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>r/WallStreetBets went private — and now it’s back with a message</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fm2mk6x45QHtA0YzSyR4-DD0ZYI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731247/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ygczh"&gt;The r/WallStreetBets subreddit’s own moderators made it private for a little less than an hour on Wednesday evening, Reddit confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;  — but now, it’s back, with a new post from the moderators themselves that doesn’t quite explain why it vanished in the first place. The subreddit has seen a significant increase in attention in recent days following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;meteoric rise in GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt; driven in part by traders on the forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUYnY9"&gt;“We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep,” reads &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/"&gt;a new post from the mods&lt;/a&gt;, one which you can read in its entirety at the bottom of this post in case it disappears. “We’ve got so many comments and submissions that we can’t possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators,” the post continues, addressing how the community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;has also been banned from Discord&lt;/a&gt; and how they believe Reddit’s tools are insufficient to moderate bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu8DFI"&gt;The post also points to a Twitter account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsbmod"&gt;@wsbmod&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to be the official voice of the moderator team in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tJr0dS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMoVs9"&gt;During the time the subreddit was private, there were a few different messages shown to visitors. When I checked the subreddit at 7:06PM ET, I saw this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ayzF1m"&gt;We are experiencing technical difficulties based on unprecedented scale as a result of the newfound interest in WSB. We are unable to ensure Reddit’s content policy and the WSB rules are enforceable without a technology platform that can support automation of this enforcement. WSB will be back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/53chGWnjtZM6iC4kB-x7304S_LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.07.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L3pwBm"&gt;Before that, the page showed this message: “WallStreetBets is under in tents load and is only for approved submitters. In the meantime, please enjoy some spaghetti,” followed by a link to a NSFW video of a man putting spaghetti all over his body.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZynvoi3RaHJrANIfD9V2l9UpHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264493/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.04.06_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s4RjHK"&gt;And when the r/WallStreetBets was first made private, the message read, “like 4Chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” which was the description of the subreddit previous to it being made private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKYHRCYmMYY31eOCwO-0aCSsnD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264483/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_3.46.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="08QAtr"&gt;Mysteriously, some people claimed they lost their existing access to r/WallStreetBets when it went private:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fMzTKm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Lost access to wallstreetbets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wsb?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#wsb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/y2qsVnC4Zb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/y2qsVnC4Zb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— sunny  (@ytinvestment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ytinvestment/status/1354575140978212866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="YxklKY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I just got removed from WSB... random. Been on there for half a year&lt;/p&gt;— dawson schrader (@dawson_schrader) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dawson_schrader/status/1354576538264604677?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="iauUOI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wallstreetbets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt; hi, somehow I can’t access the page anymore? I’ve been a member since December? What happened?&lt;/p&gt;—  Daam Stevens   (@daamsincome) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daamsincome/status/1354578019269169153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ScRW2f"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wait did they just take down wallstreetbets??     I can’t access it either    &lt;a href="https://t.co/QH6fvHkLdW"&gt;https://t.co/QH6fvHkLdW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris (@TechChris_NC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TechChris_NC/status/1354576613099397124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eI0fB"&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;Discord banned the r/WallStreetBets server&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that the Discord was banned for “continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.” Many posts on the subreddit contain offensive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUWjLj"&gt;Here is the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/"&gt;full post&lt;/a&gt; from the r/WallStreetBets moderators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zgKoG5"&gt;We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep. We’ve got so many comments and submissions that we can’t possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn’t allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven’t given us special access despite asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5nRQi"&gt;We’re suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and &lt;strong&gt;I am not impressed with them destroying our community&lt;/strong&gt; instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQnTJH"&gt;To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won’t mention their accounts, but lots of handles with “wsb” and “wallstreetbets” in them are pretending to speak for us. They’re saying things that we don’t agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There’s also too much political bullshit in a community that was never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8HoB0"&gt;That is why I’m throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren’t doing anything wrong here if they don’t respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can’t be expected to meet any expectations when we aren’t given the tools we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6F0MF1"&gt;That’s not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it’s clear to me we can’t do nothing and we need a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nknVqB"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/wsbmod"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://twitter.com/wsbmod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;@wsbmod&lt;/strong&gt; is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui1eP2"&gt;We’ll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kn4Rfo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 8:01PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;r/WallStreetBets has reopened, with a message from a moderator, which we have added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUwag"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMhN3y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit vs. Wall Street: the latest in the GameStop saga</title>

  &lt;p&gt;The story of r/WallStreetBets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="FvTBIJ"&gt;Subreddit r/WallStreetBets has been the talk of the Internet this week, as its members have driven GameStop’s stock prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;from around $20 to over $300&lt;/a&gt;. The community brands itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and as time has gone on, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;targeted other unlikely stocks&lt;/a&gt; like AMC, Blackberry, and Tootsie Roll. They’ve also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned from Discord for hate speech&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3YeM5"&gt;If you want to read about how the group was able to manipulate the stocks of a massive company like GameStop — and the potential fallout — maybe start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;with our explainer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s new Model S will apparently play Witcher 3 on a built-in 10 teraflop gaming rig</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umELrsZKL6bM1rGQ-mmRGGr1dr0=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731081/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BAwode"&gt;If you can’t find a PS5 or Xbox Series X, how about an $80,000 electric sports car with comparable performance? Tesla just announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;its refreshed Model S today&lt;/a&gt;, and a new “Plaid” powertrain isn’t its only performance enhancement — the company claims the car can now compete with next-gen gaming consoles, thanks to a 10-teraflop gaming computer that will apparently come with every new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFSUiR"&gt;Assuming that refers to GPU performance and Tesla isn’t wildly exaggerating, that might indeed be competitive with a PS5 or Xbox Series X, which offer 10.28 teraflops and 12 teraflops of raw GPU power respectively. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21718936/xbox-series-x-ps5-performance-game-comparison"&gt;There’s more to performance than teraflops, though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zoaRUdHMjos_BSVPCoPHChvV2FE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264387/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqGQ6"&gt;Now, you might ask: who’s going to put a game in your car that might actually take advantage of a gaming PC? For that, I must ask you to look closely at the images above and below. Behold: CD Projekt’s acclaimed sword-slinging adventure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;just as Musk foretold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wc3vE1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Want to play The Witcher game on your Tesla? (you can already watch the show on Tesla Netflix theater)&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1219881215156801537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALM8S6"&gt;Here are a number of things we still do not know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="govTzt"&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; actually coming to Tesla, and when? (We’ve asked CD Projekt.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aLUv3g"&gt;Can you play it on the 17-inch, 2200 x 1300-pixel main display, or only on the 8-inch second row display? Or both?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mMh3WH"&gt;Will you need a new controller? (Tesla says it has “wireless controller compatibility” but that’s all we know.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xYMsbj"&gt;Who’s making the GPU? (We’ve pinged Nvidia and AMD.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RybmF7"&gt;Who is going to sit in their $80,000 sports car and play a 70+ hour game? (fingers crossed for cloud saves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ktgx6v"&gt;Why not &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk? &lt;/em&gt;(Okay, this one’s a joke.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2_PNft9jF1DDMgDvFH5m_LKfWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264385/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nGRD56"&gt;You can see the claims for yourself at Tesla’s Model S website, though they’re a little buried: you have to &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/models/design#overview"&gt;go to the shop&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down to “Interior” and click on “Feature Details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY8bFi"&gt;Tesla’s been bringing games to its cars for a while now: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried out Tesla Arcade on a Model 3 back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and both the first level of &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; and a car karaoke mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885822/tesla-software-version-10-now-available-features-netflix-youtube-spotify"&gt;came to the company’s in-car software&lt;/a&gt; later that year. &lt;em&gt;Fallout Shelter &lt;/em&gt;was added to the cars last year.&lt;/p&gt;
