    <title>Nreal’s new AR sunglasses are made for binge watching TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nreal Air smart glasses" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bzGyI5aZ9JZ2PeTyxaNetUdUTBU=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930661/Close_up.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nreal Air smart glasses.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UKei5Q"&gt;Augmented reality company Nreal is launching a cheaper, iOS-compatible, more compact version of its smart glasses. The new Nreal Air glasses are supposed to ship starting in December 2021 across Japan, China, and South Korea. The price isn’t set, but Nreal says they’ll cost “a fraction of the price” of its earlier Nreal Light glasses, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;started selling for around $600&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xl2bn"&gt;Based on Nreal’s description, the new Nreal Air glasses have some core similarities with the Nreal Light glasses from 2020. Both are designed to look like relatively normal sunglasses and pitched as ideal for projecting a virtual big-screen display in front of your eyes. They’re both using micro OLED displays for their augmented reality optics and are powered by a phone via a tether cable. And they’re both aimed at consumers rather than businesses, researchers, or the military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pGfvvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Unlike Nreal’s last glasses, there are no outward-facing cameras&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mujcaY"&gt;But Nreal Air glasses have a different feature set than their predecessors. Similar to Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap hardware, the original Nreal Light glasses could map physical space around you with a set of outward-facing cameras. Nreal Air glasses, by contrast, don’t have any outward-facing cameras. They can display video and phone apps, but they can’t see what’s around you, which means they don’t have the spatial awareness and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167724/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-hand-tracking-clay-air-5g-qualcomm"&gt;hand tracking options&lt;/a&gt; the Nreal Light does. You’ll control them with a smartphone app, an option that’s also available on Light glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgrBGC"&gt;The upside is that Nreal Air glasses are ironically much lighter than Light glasses at 77 grams instead of 106 grams. They don’t have the slightly bug-eyed look that Light glasses do — in product renders, they look more like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban’s smart glasses&lt;/a&gt;, minus the front-facing cameras. (The Ray-Ban Stories glasses, which have cameras but no AR display, weigh around 50 grams.) The new glasses let users tilt the lenses at three angles, making it potentially easier for more people to get a clearer image. Nreal Light glasses launched with support for specific 5G Android phones, but the new glasses will also work while tethered to iPhones and iPads as well as “most” Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nreal Air AR glasses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgbB8X0G2FIDpUqdNxB7BMK-CRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888760/Nreal_Air_Front.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YxrEiQ"&gt;Compared to the Light, the Nreal Air glasses also have a higher screen refresh rate of 90Hz and an increased pixel density of 49 PPD. Nreal says the glasses’ field of view is 46 degrees, compared to the Nreal Light’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nreal/status/1281272536291053568?lang=en"&gt;52 degrees&lt;/a&gt; — it equates the Air’s view with a 130-inch screen from 3 meters away or a 201-inch screen at 6 meters. If wearers have friends with Nreal glasses, there’s a viewing party option that turns that screen into a shared virtual theater where they can all watch the same media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rLPdT"&gt;Nreal intends to expand the Air glasses’ rollout in 2022, and a spokesperson says the US is a “major market” for the company, although it hasn’t announced plans to ship there. As with the Light, it’s going to be selling the glasses in partnership with major phone carriers; it hasn’t named specific partners, but it’s previously worked with Germany’s Deutsche Telekom, Korea’s LG Uplus, and Japan’s KDDI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CNCtJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;78 percent of users in Korea watched streaming video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a5PBzD"&gt;An Nreal spokesperson says the company developed the Air after realizing that most users were primarily either using the glasses to watch streaming video (and to a lesser extent, browse the web) or to develop apps for the platform. In Korea, around 78 percent of users watched streaming content with the glasses. “Consumers today are seeking lighter, but longer lasting AR glasses exclusively for streaming media and working from home,” company founder Chi Xu said in a statement. According to Nreal, the lack of cameras is also supposed to reassure bystanders that the glasses don’t threaten their privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKd1pj"&gt;Nreal is one of a handful of consumer smart glasses, and these results could hint at what people actually want from AR headsets. But Nreal also hasn’t made a concerted play for experiences that mix the real and virtual worlds — a use case that other companies like Facebook have emphasized more heavily. Instead, it’s focusing on something it already knows people love: binge watching video.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify expands interactive podcast polls and Q&amp;As to even more shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUBkd85ujuQVEiAvfUI4FLE0xw4=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930558/spotifyinteractie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oUkhC"&gt;Spotify is making podcasts on its platform more interactive. The company announced today that podcasters who create their shows in Anchor, its creation software, will be able to build interactive polls and Q&amp;amp;As into their programs. Listeners across 160 markets will be able to engage with them. For now, the functionality is only available to Anchor podcasters — not even for people who use Megaphone, Spotify’s podcast hosting platform — and it only works on the Spotify app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7K644"&gt;To view a poll or Q&amp;amp;A, you’ll see it at the bottom of your Spotify mobile app. Once you respond to a poll, you’ll be able to see how others voted, while Q&amp;amp;A answers will be sent to the podcaster privately. These podcasters can then choose to pin and publicly display the Spotify username of the person who replied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qplNbf"&gt;The interactive polls were first tested in September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452248/spotify-podcast-polls-interactive-test-exclusive-app"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, and in February, Spotify brought them and Q&amp;amp;As to more creators. The company says podcasters have used them to get guest suggestions, hear feedback, and gamify their shows. Interestingly, Spotify has also tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295859/spotify-interactive-ads-podcasts-in-app-offer-launch"&gt;interactive ads&lt;/a&gt;, but those seemingly have yet to launch, even for wider testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uidijz"&gt;Of course, these new features allow Spotify to keep podcasters on the app where their listeners live. They don’t have to promote their Instagram or any other app to foster engagement, meaning they might have a better success rate in encouraging their listeners to share feedback. At the same time, it’s yet another incentive for podcasters who might be looking for a hosting provider. Anchor creators can already create shows with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21514855/spotify-music-podcast-format-anchor-listen"&gt;full, licensed music&lt;/a&gt; built in, and use the company’s sponsorships tool, so Spotify will seemingly keep creating functionality meant to intrigue and lure podcasters to the service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BlueStacks X is a new and free way to play Android games in your browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7s8TgzqHBUq6jAC-aeG_QEO87lI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930557/bluestacksx.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bluestacks X brings Android games to the browser.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bluestacks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eHKv18"&gt;BlueStacks started off life as an Android emulator for Windows more than 10 years ago, allowing anyone to run native Arm-based or x86 Android apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/10/2696168/bluestacks-android-apps-windows-8"&gt;on Windows PCs and tablets&lt;/a&gt;. Now BlueStacks is transitioning to the cloud, bringing Android games to the browser and across iOS, Windows, macOS, Android, and Linux devices, and even inside Discord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBB9GC"&gt;BlueStacks X launches today as the only cloud gaming service that offers free streaming of mobile games across multiple platforms and devices. BlueStacks has built its hybrid cloud technology under its &lt;a href="https://now.gg/"&gt;now.gg brand&lt;/a&gt; to make this possible, combined with Amazon’s AWS Graviton servers. BlueStacks X also offloads part of the compute and graphics rendering to local devices thanks to advancements in modern web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsEmTQ"&gt;The result is the ability to play a variety of Android mobile games inside a browser with no downloads necessary. BlueStacks X is launching as a beta, with around 14 games available to stream and the promise of more titles being added weekly. Games like &lt;em&gt;Raid: Shadow Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Disney Sorcerer’s Arena&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Lords Mobile: Kingdom Wars&lt;/em&gt; are all available today. You can also use the regular native app to play more than 200 games that aren’t available in the cloud just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hrc61MqCDwDF7AqY9rCfcgHo_0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889777/bluestacksxbrowser.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BlueStacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueStacks X lets you run mobile Android games inside a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IC7Y9s"&gt;BlueStacks has also created its own Discord bot, &lt;a href="https://cloudy.gg/"&gt;Cloudy&lt;/a&gt;, that will integrate into Discord servers and allow friends to launch cloud-based Android games and share their gameplay sessions with others. “We’ll also allow you to customize what games you want on your server, and if you play those games together you automatically get connected to a Discord voice channel so everyone can just click and play the cloud game,” explains BlueStacks CEO Rosen Sharma, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrSIEU"&gt;A social feed will also be integrated into Discord, so if your friend buys a gun in a game, it might appear in the Discord feed much like how PlayStation and Xbox display achievements in their social feeds. “It’s like what Venmo did to PayPal,” says Sharma. “PayPal were just sending money and Venmo made it into a social feed.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1JbU2SRCARxE4s__pM6L8o_UYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889768/Cloudy_Bot___Feed_message.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BlueStacks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;BlueStacks’ Cloudy Discord bot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BXDqJP"&gt;BlueStacks is offering all of this free of charge, supported by ads. Sharma tells me that you’ll only see pre-roll ads, and not the type that will interrupt gameplay. Down the line there could be subscription offerings for its cloud-based service, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNQ4l2"&gt;BlueStacks has been focused on mobile gaming since 2016, after it was clear its user base was mainly using the app to access games. “When we started, people were like ‘who’s going to use this?’” admits Sharma. “In 2016 it became all about gaming, and gaming became the predominant use case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTu2BS"&gt;The cloud infrastructure for Arm-based mobile games simply didn’t exist 10 years ago, and suitable Arm-based servers only started rolling out in 2018 to make BlueStacks X a reality. BlueStacks has been growing in popularity in recent years, and Sharma tells me it gets between 250,000 to 300,000 downloads a day. There’s even 20,000 enterprise customers using BlueStacks to access Android mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsAVET"&gt;BlueStack’s cloud launch and popularity comes just as Microsoft gets ready to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Android apps to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650000/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support"&gt;won’t be shipping&lt;/a&gt; Windows 11 with its Android apps integration, despite promising it as a key new feature at an event in June.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jeTpCQDu2uyS5B7e_bJErJacTcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22816768/androidappswindows11.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft is bringing Android apps to Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45L9Sm"&gt;Sharma doesn’t seem convinced by Microsoft’s Android integration in Windows, though. “There are two things Microsoft needs to figure out: is it apps and is it their way of getting Instagram, TikTok, and those things; or is it games?” says Sharma. “I don’t think it’s the same beast, and those are two completely different things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqe7RA"&gt;BlueStacks has been working with Microsoft for two years to help the company optimize its Hyper-V for Android, says Sharma, noting that the company has been very focused on the apps side. “Microsoft has always had the app problem, and in the past they used to pay people like the top developers to bring their apps, but that doesn’t really work in mobile because there’s just too many apps,” explains Sharma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMQHHy"&gt;While BlueStacks is compatible with Google Play Store apps, Microsoft is partnering with Amazon, meaning developers will need to tweak their apps and games to remove key integration with Google Play Services. “My sense is any play that requires the developer to do a small amount of work or a large amount of work is a slow and long-drawn process,” says Sharma. “It’s unlikely to be successful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKTl7c"&gt;Microsoft is pushing ahead with Android apps on Windows 11, and we’ll likely see a preview of its initial work in the coming weeks. It’s still around 10 years late to the Android-apps-on-Windows party, but that might not matter if the integration is done well and performance is solid across multiple devices. That’s easier said than done, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9bks1"&gt;Meanwhile, BlueStacks X launches in the browser today, available at &lt;a href="https://x.bluestacks.com/#/cloudGames"&gt;x.bluestacks.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos Beam (second-gen) review: Atmos(t) a minor upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Dolby Atmos isn’t the reason you should buy it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4eOVyH"&gt;From the moment Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22671384/sonos-beam-2-atmos-soundbar-announced-price-specs"&gt;announced the second-generation Beam&lt;/a&gt; soundbar, it was evident that this sequel is more refresh than reinvention. The new Beam, available October 5th and now slightly more expensive at $449, is the same compact size as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;the 2018 original&lt;/a&gt;. The speaker drivers inside the unit are completely unchanged. Sonos has touched up the appearance by switching from a fabric covering on the first Beam to the company’s signature perforated plastic with finely drilled holes running along the entire front of the soundbar. And because it’s equipped with more processing power and eARC, the new model supports immersive Dolby Atmos audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feJYdY"&gt;But the target customer for the Beam hasn’t changed one bit: this is a soundbar for people who want to upgrade their TV’s lousy built-in audio — with the enticing side benefit of native integration with Sonos’ multiroom audio system. At its price, the Beam is more expensive than entry-level soundbars from Vizio and the like. And if you’re willing to spend double, you can get much larger, beefier Atmos soundbars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;like Sonos’ own Arc&lt;/a&gt; or alternatives from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;Sony&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660982/bose-smart-soundbar-900-dolby-atmos-sonos-arc"&gt;Bose&lt;/a&gt;. The Beam is dwarfed in size by the Arc, and its sound performance doesn’t approach the same level. But I can still see and understand the appeal of choosing this one instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RwRe6T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10781329"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G590tI"&gt;Maybe you’re in an apartment where more powerful speakers would agitate the neighbors. Maybe you don’t care about or feel the need to invest in premium-tier home theater audio: you just want to make your movies and TV shows sound noticeably better, and the Beam’s smart speaker functions and wide support for music streaming are just icing on the cake. If that’s what you’re after, the second-gen Beam does the job equally as well as the first. Slightly better, even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gpnStNO0TbRnhnK13IEX_uxO3x0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888935/cwelch_290921_4780_5684.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Beam has a perforated polycarbonate grille instead of fabric.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M6PB6r"&gt;Just don’t get your hopes up about the whole Dolby Atmos surround sound part. When reviewing the original Beam, Nilay said the key was to not overthink it. But by making Atmos a pillar of the second-gen model, Sonos is leaving room for people to do just that and come in with unrealistic expectations. As I’ll get into later, for all the work Sonos has put into virtualization and tuning to try to replicate Atmos’ enveloping height channels, it turns out there’s really no substitute for speakers that are pointed, well, &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Dg1Ag"&gt;Aside from the sleeker perforated front side, everything else about the Beam’s external appearance is identical to the original. You’ve got the same capacitive touch playback controls on top — including a button to mute the built-in voice assistant mics — and the same ports on back: there’s HDMI, an ethernet jack, a connect button, and the power input. What’s new about the second-gen Beam is that Sonos has upgraded the HDMI port to support eARC, which enables Atmos and comes with other perks that often go unadvertised. For example, if you’ve got a TV with HDMI 2.1, you shouldn’t encounter any audio and video sync issues (even when gaming), which could be frustratingly common on the first Beam. That alone is a reason I’d buy this hardware over the original given the choice — even if you can still find the old Beam for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8lVEa"&gt;Setup remains a relatively quick, easy process using the Sonos app for Android or iOS. I plugged the Beam into my LG CX OLED TV, opened the app, the new device was automatically recognized, and then I held my phone near the soundbar to finish linking it to my system via NFC. iPhone owners still get exclusive access to Sonos’ Trueplay feature, which uses the phone’s mic to optimize the soundbar’s audio output to sound best for any room in which it’s being used. Considering the Beam has its own mic array, why not just build automatic Trueplay into the thing? Android users can still take manual control of sliders for bass, treble, and loudness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top controls are identical to those on the old model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxaKWFPLyjazrFUH4uG0ZZoa2Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888938/cwelch_290921_4780_5701.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As are the ports, but now you get an eARC HDMI port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mRIsI1"&gt;The Beam’s 40-percent faster processor allowed Sonos to add more “arrays” — the software that coordinates the playback and sophisticated phase algorithms between all the soundbar’s speakers — and the new ones are fully dedicated to surround sound and height effects. But remember, the acoustic architecture inside hasn’t changed from the first Beam. There’s a center tweeter, four midwoofers, and three passive radiators that Sonos says help to enhance lower frequencies. However, physics are physics, and we’re talking about a soundbar that’s barely over two feet wide; in other words, you’re going to want a Sub if you need growling, powerful bass. The Beam won’t get you there on its own, but neither does the Arc or most any standalone soundbar for that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svqprA"&gt;But the Beam is still a strong performer that tends to genuinely surprise people for its size, and this one fares even better. It can fill most smaller to midsized living rooms (or bedrooms) without straining itself. And the amount of presence and great stereo separation of the first model has carried over to the new device. The general surround virtualization effect is quite good: you can get lost in movies without it being obvious that all the sound is originating from the soundbar beneath the TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u4Bmo"&gt;Watch a car chase or some fighter jet sequences, and you’ll hear that the Beam does an impressive job having audio “swoop” in from the left and right sides of a room — assuming your walls aren’t terribly far apart. The feeling of spaciousness is very real, and in A/B testing with the original Beam, this is where those new arrays are making the biggest difference. I’ve seen Sonos describe it as panoramic sound, and that seems right on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7detyi"&gt;The company has also made some tweaks that result in even clearer dialogue in regular listening, and the “speech enhancement” mode is still there if you need even more emphasis on what’s being said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ic_ObSCz6SBTUL2-DGpoj6o9f4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22888939/cwelch_290921_4780_5681.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The actual speaker drivers inside are also unchanged.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zd8pLz"&gt;But as for the Atmos part? Meh. My bedroom has fairly low ceilings, but even when sampling go-to Atmos action scenes in movies, I can’t say I often picked up on any standout height effects. Don’t buy the Sonos Beam in hopes that it’ll legitimately sound as though audio is coming from above. It just doesn’t get there. You can bounce carefully phased sound waves off walls all you want, but it won’t hold a candle to a proper Atmos system with in-ceiling speakers. Even some owners of premium soundbars like the Arc that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have up-firing speakers don’t consider the Atmos aspect to be a game-changer. If your room conditions are ideal, you might get some hints of verticality, but there’s no real illusion of 3D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i09ALE"&gt;Even if it’s low on Atmos magic, the Beam can be the start of a really great surround system if you tack on a Sub and other Sonos speakers as rear surrounds. (Opting for the Ikea Symfonisk bookshelf speakers is a popular way to save on the latter.) You’re looking at well over $1,000 to build a proper 5.1 setup, but if you see yourself staying in the Sonos ecosystem for a long time to come, it’s worth considering. Adding in extra speakers can quickly make you forget about the Beam’s size constraints. And you can always upgrade to an Arc down the line and keep everything else in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="bulhwl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10781068"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXfvgD3GSByN-6erWH864zxnjjQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889000/DSCF5692_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use either Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant voice commands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ2FCK"&gt;Everything else about the Beam can already be found on the first model. It’s still totally competent as a music speaker (and the improved virtualization helps here too), though not as well-matched for that as something like the Sonos Five. You can choose to use either Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa as your preferred voice assistant — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700724/sonos-smart-speakers-concurrency-google"&gt;but not both at once&lt;/a&gt;, even if it’s technically possible. (You can also just skip setting up a voice assistant if you’d rather avoid them). The soundbar supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, so you can play music, podcasts, or other audio to it from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And you can also send TV audio across your other Sonos speakers if you’re so inclined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKsHDl"&gt;At the center of everything is Sonos’ compatibility with pretty much every streaming audio service under the sun. The company has said it’ll add support for high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos tracks from Amazon Music later this year, and hopefully the same will pan out for Apple Music. Sonos is also granting a longtime customer request with the introduction of DTS decoding, another feature coming to all of its soundbars in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6wmBDg"&gt;Sonos’ addition of Dolby Atmos to the second-generation Beam doesn’t magically turn it into some mind-blowing $450 soundbar. But it’s still a very good one made better by the new virtualization upgrades and its seamless integration with your other Sonos gear. That, combined with the company’s impressive commitment to software support, are still the biggest reasons to spend the extra cash on this instead of buying a perfectly good Vizio bar for less. The upgrade to eARC makes for a smoother, more dependable listening experience without any latency issues, and the new design will look better in your living room. But a lack of proper up-firing speakers limits the Atmos potential, and the fact that Sonos has reused so much of the hardware here makes the second-gen Beam feel like a half-step toward something more ambitious. I expect to see bigger things whenever the third generation comes along.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Backbone releases free adapter and 3D-print files for iPhone 13 Pro camera bump issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5pTzJYYDGcJV2im_LTmgwbvwrlc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69913581/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hk174V"&gt;Backbone Labs has acknowledged the issue that hampers the use of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;excellent iPhone gaming controller&lt;/a&gt; with the new iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22691301/iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-backbone-one-gaming-controller-accessory"&gt;As we noticed last week&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone 13 Pro’s thicker camera bump means the phone doesn’t sit neatly in the Backbone One controller, either sticking out on one side or causing the bridge on the back to slightly buckle. It’s not unusable, but it’s not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uV1mXY"&gt;“We spent a tremendous amount of time meticulously crafting every surface of Backbone One (both bits and atoms) and even designing universal support for the iPhones available when it was released,” a Backbone representative wrote in an &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Backbone/comments/pvhl98/backbone_one_iphone_13_pro_pro_max_adapter/"&gt;official post on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we’re disappointed in the situation at hand. Several folks on the team even upgraded to 13 Pro Max for a better gaming experience, and while the fit may be acceptable for some users, it’s not as good as we’d like it to be.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WquSRF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0nAvVr"&gt;To address this, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplaybackbone.com%2Fadapter%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F27%2F22695887%2Fbackbone-controller-iphone-13-pro-camera-bump-3d-printed-adapter" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Backbone has designed an adapter&lt;/a&gt; that is intended to improve the experience with the iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max. Ordering one will require the latest version of the Backbone app. Once you boot into it, you should see a pop-up that will guide you through the process of ordering one. Otherwise, you can open the app, then go to Settings, find the Help button, then click “Request Adapter.” It’s free to order, but you’ll pay shipping fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZFzsm"&gt;Backbone has also released open-source 3D printable files for the adapter, if you’d prefer to go that route. &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4977709"&gt;The files are hosted on Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;. It says on its site that “UPS offers printing services, there are tons of free local printers at libraries, and websites like Shapeways allow you to order prints to your doorstep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwUaUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 30th, 8:42AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Backbone has added a support page that details the installation process for the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adapter. Additionally, it has steps for Backbone One owners, both current and new, to redeem a free adapter or 3D print it themselves.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DISH bets on 5G by making its own $280 5G phone for Boost Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RfU8j1kHb_dlt0G11qeknp5YOw=/90x0:1710x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930334/Celero_Option2_1800x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DISH and Boost Mobile hope to bring in new 5G customers with their own phone, the Celero5G.&lt;/em&gt; | DISH/Boost Mobile&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x0s0B3"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquiring Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Sprint and T-Mobile merger in 2020 and snapping up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319621/dish-network-acquires-republic-wireless-5g-cell-carrier-mvno-t-mobile"&gt;Republic Wireless for its 5G network&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Dish is finally ready to turn Boost Mobile into the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;fourth wireless carrier that the FCC envisioned&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMGgqB"&gt;Its opening salvo? The satellite television provider is introducing an exclusive budget 5G phone for Boost Mobile’s prepaid customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czzVHh"&gt;The Celero5G is a “custom-built phone” for Boost Mobile, according to its spokesperson. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557433/t-mobile-revvl-v-5g-price-screen-specs-availability"&gt;T-Mobile’s Revvl&lt;/a&gt; or AT&amp;amp;T’s Radiant, it has unique branding that you won’t find anywhere else. For a carrier that is trying to expand its user base, this is certainly an unusual way to get there. After all, most other carriers try to dangle the latest flagship phones from Apple and Android to lure you to sign up for their expensive post-paid service plans, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;deluge of “free” iPhone 13 offers&lt;/a&gt; from the Big 3 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BOEGoM"&gt;“With LG leaving the mobile device market and creating seismic shifts in the supplier landscape, we saw an opportunity,” said a Boost Mobile spokesperson. “The departure of LG left a significant hole in the Boost lineup. Celero5G is the response to fill that hole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlQczK"&gt;Not much is known about this 5G phone at the moment besides the fact its name, Celero5G, is inspired by the “Latin word for speed.” According to the press release, the phone has a 6.52-inch display, four cameras, 36 hours of battery life, 4GB RAM, a microSD card slot, and 64GB of internal storage — all respectable specifications for a budget phone. Like the sub-$300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, this phone is probably powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 690 5G chip that makes 5G connectivity possible at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oJFa6F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Celero5G fills a LG-sized hole in Boost Mobile’s lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mcGsXb"&gt;Judging by the press materials that Boost Mobile provided, it looks like the Celero5G has an iPhone-like metallic trim around the phone, and a glass back, which are rather upscale touches for a phone of this class. Perhaps this phone really is “superior to other mid-tier Android devices at higher price points,” as the press release claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFINtE"&gt;The best part about this phone is the plan. If you pre-order the Celero5G by October 31, 2021, you will get 12 months of free unlimited talk, text, and data service from Boost Mobile. Of course, it’s not completely unlimited: you will be downgraded to 2G after burning through 35GB of data, but it’s still plenty to use comfortably. Dish and Boost Mobile will even give you a free case for your $280 Celero5G 5G phone.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pXwwQ"&gt;Signing up and keeping existing Boost Mobile customers with the Celero5G may be the easiest part of realizing Dish’s 5G dreams. Its biggest challenge will be to build out and provide national coverage to its 5G service — a  project that is much more expensive and challenging than releasing an exclusive 5G phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFcG2u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fairphone’s latest sustainable smartphone comes with a five-year warranty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFSm8pgeN4YONzo30D4MpbSJmEs=/0x0:3969x2646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930128/Fairphone_02_grey_phone_in_hand_on_couch_Kera_0091_C1_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fairphone 4’s updated design makes it look like a modern smartphone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Fairphone 4&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vr0H02"&gt;Fairphone, the manufacturer focused on making easy to repair smartphones made out of ethically sourced materials, just took the wraps off its fourth-generation handset. The Fairphone 4 uses a modular design that’s similar to the company’s previous phones, only now with more powerful internals, a five-year warranty, and a promise of two major Android updates and software support until the end of 2025. Prices start at €579 / £499 for the phone, which will ship on October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq3T8m"&gt;I’ve been using the Fairphone 4 for a couple of days as my primary phone, and while I’m not ready to give a final verdict just yet, it feels like a big step forward compared to the dated designs and low-power components found in the company’s previous phones. Stay tuned for my full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1daxC7"&gt;Fairphone’s ambition is to produce a more ethical alternative to modern smartphones. That means making a device that’s ethically sourced using sustainable materials before providing the software support and warranty to make it useable for as long as possible. Although Fairphone is only guaranteeing software support until the end of 2025, it has ambitions to extend this as far as 2027. In an ideal world, Fairphone would also like to eventually release 2024’s Android 15 as an update to the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/up1_EG9tNOFkd0m4c_SfDHk3DUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887059/Fairphone_09_repairing_grey_phone_Keira_0069_C2_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fairphone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like Fairphone’s previous devices, the Fairphone 4 is designed to be easy to disassemble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h3H3ln"&gt;Normally, the specs of Fairphone’s devices are secondary to its ethical considerations, but unlike its previous phones, the Fairphone 4 is competitive with other mid-range Android handsets. The 5G handset is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 750G processor, and that’s paired with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128 or 256GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD. It’s powered by a 3,905mAh removable battery, and the display is a 6.3-inch 1080p LCD panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq6W69"&gt;There are two rear cameras — a 48-megapixel main camera and a 48-megapixel ultrawide — and a single 25-megapixel selfie camera. The main rear camera is equipped with optical image stabilization and can record at up to 4K / 30fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCGCMp"&gt;A notable downside compared to previous Fairphones is that the Fairphone 4 no longer includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a choice that feels at odds with the company’s otherwise customer-first approach. Fairphone tells me it made this decision in order to be able to offer an official IP rating for dust and water resistance, which was missing from the company’s previous phones. It’s only IP54, which means it’s protected from light splashes rather than full submersion, but that’s impressive in light of its removable rear cover and modular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2DwJSg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No plans for a US release for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3A5n1w"&gt;Regarding its modularity, Fairphone is selling eight repair modules for the phone, which include replacement displays, batteries, back covers, USB-C ports, loudspeakers, earpieces, rear cameras, and selfie cameras. All of these are easily removable using a standard Philips head screwdriver, which means customers should be able to carry out a lot of repairs themselves. But, if you need to turn to a professional, Fairphone says its spare parts are readily available for local repair shops to buy and use themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqG2V2"&gt;Fairphone’s previous two phones are the only devices to have received &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fsmartphone-repairability%3Fsort%3Dscore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F30%2F22700014%2Ffairphone-4-release-date-news-features-warranty-price-sustainable" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;perfect repairability scores from iFixit&lt;/a&gt;, and the company tells me it believes the Fairphone 4 is even more repairable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgUPR1"&gt;The hope is for these spare parts to be available until at least 2027. Fairphone has a good track record with previous devices, telling me it still has parts in stock for the six-year-old Fairphone 2, two years after the last handset was sold. But product manager Miquel Ballester concedes that the company has run out of certain parts for that model.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HkEF2FHwpum8W-kZquDJEBBkcQA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22887060/Fairphone_03_grey_phone_from_back_Kera_0114_C1_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fairphone&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the rear are two cameras and a TOF sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ogqpZC"&gt;So too does Fairphone have a solid record on the software side of providing major Android updates for its phones… eventually. Earlier this year, the company officially released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349953/fairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support"&gt;Android 9 update for the Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;, a device that originally launched with Android 5. It may have come almost three years after Android 9’s original release, but it means that the phone continues to run an officially supported version of Google’s operating system. It bodes well for Fairphone’s support aspirations for the Fairphone 4, although it will have to contend with the fact that Qualcomm only officially supports its chipsets for three major OS updates and four years of security updates, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/qualcomm-promises-three-years-of-android-updates-for-its-entire-soc-lineup/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h64dao"&gt;In terms of materials, the Fairphone 4 is made using Fairtrade-certified gold; responsibly sourced aluminum and tungsten; and recycled tin, rare earth minerals, and plastic (including its rear panel, which is 100 percent recycled polycarbonate). The company has various initiatives to improve the working conditions of miners and factory workers involved in the supply chains for its devices. Fairphone also claims that the Fairphone 4 is the “first electronic waste neutral handset” because it’ll recycle one phone or an equal amount of e-waste for each device sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icj5sw"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is available to preorder today in Europe and should ship starting October 25th. The model with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage costs €579 / £499, while the step-up model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage retails for €649 / ￡569. Unfortunately, there’s no sign of a US release: Fairphone says it’s interested but that it’s focusing on Europe for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9J9GPS"&gt;Microsoft is launching its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. The software giant has been testing streaming Xbox Game Pass Ultimate games in these markets over the past few months, and is now ready to greatly expand the reach of its xCloud technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oZa31"&gt;XCloud will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers in Brazil and Mexico later today, meaning it technically launches in Australia and Japan in the early hours of October 1st. Xbox Cloud Gaming will be available through the dedicated Android and Xbox Windows apps, or via the web for iOS and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6SGPn"&gt;Microsoft is now offering Xbox Cloud Gaming in 26 countries, thanks to this big expansion. “Since cloud gaming is powered by custom Xbox Series X consoles, that means these games are being played on an Xbox in the cloud, bringing faster load times and improved frame rates to the gameplay experience,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/30/xbox-cloud-gaming-launches-in-australia-brazil-japan-and-mexico/"&gt;explains Catherine Gluckstein&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of Project xCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQMJYK"&gt;Alongside the expansion of Xbox Cloud Gaming, Microsoft also announced during its Tokyo Game Show broadcast that &lt;em&gt;Scarlet Nexus&lt;/em&gt; will be arriving on Xbox Game Pass later today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox chief warns console supply constraints will last into 2022</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I7yVyk"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, says console supply issues will continue into 2022. In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/gaming-leaders-strauss-zelnick-of-take-two-xboxs-phil-spencer-join-thegrill-2021/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-console-supply-issues-will-continue-into-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spencer admits the Xbox supply issues will last for the rest of the year and into 2022 due to supply chain complications beyond just a chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VkjAt"&gt;“I think it’s probably too isolated to talk about it as just a chip problem,” says Spencer. “When I think about, what does it mean to get the parts necessary to build a console today, and then get it to the markets where the demand is, there are multiple kind of pinch points in that process. And I think regretfully it’s going to be with us for months and months, definitely through the end of this calendar year and into the next calendar year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEbkvs"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has impacted various companies for 18 months now. Car manufacturers have had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;scale back production&lt;/a&gt; of vehicles, and it’s been near impossible to find stock of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297039/playstation-ceo-ps5-supply-2021-stock-consoles-jim-ryan"&gt;PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LyNzV"&gt;Spencer isn’t alone in his predictions about the supply issues, either. Chip manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;TSMC warned earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the industry chip shortages could continue through 2022. Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Nvidia said it expects&lt;/a&gt; GPU supply constraints for the “vast majority” of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda is doubling down on rockets, robots, and flying cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RdLZS3Tb7c5gGhR-GQB7Kpirhks=/0x108:2581x1829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69930004/187513_Honda_e_and_Frankfurt_International_Motor_Show_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnKpGu"&gt;Honda is increasing its research and development spending in three futuristic areas: rockets, robots, and electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft (eVTOL), otherwise known as flying cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DyHFk7"&gt;The automaker will spend $45 billion (5 trillion yen) on R&amp;amp;D over the next six years. But Honda won’t say what fraction of that amount will be spent on developing rockets, robots, and flying cars, nor even if it plans on pursuing those projects as commercial businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0r3WP"&gt;In fact, Honda sees robots, rockets, and eVTOL aircraft as an extension of its main business of manufacturing automobiles. If the company can get a better electric vehicle platform out of it, for example, then it will be worth the investment. Basically, it wants to see if it can make working prototypes before taking the next step. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aZuKxw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Core technologies in these areas are connected to our existing businesses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehTwxm"&gt;“Core technologies in these areas are connected to our existing businesses,” said Marcos Frommer, head of corporate communications for Honda, in a briefing with reporters, “and we are pursuing these new areas as an expansion of our core business as a mobility company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiJ8oC"&gt;Honda says it’s looking into eVTOL aircraft that could be used as part of an urban taxi service. But unlike most startups that are building lightweight, multi-prop vehicles that run on lithium-ion batteries, Honda says it will pursue a hybrid solution “as a means to realize the range desired by our customers,” Frommer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sejmx5"&gt;Honda says that pure battery-electric aircraft will only be able to achieve a maximum range of “several 10s of kilometers,” he said. By using gas turbines to supplement an electric motor, Honda says it will be able to achieve a range of up to 250 miles, enabling more commercially viable trips, like between Boston and New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqsh6r"&gt;Honda says it will make a decision on whether to pursue a commercial air taxi service “before 2025,” with the aim of obtaining regulatory certification and launching a new service by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Vafe"&gt;Honda isn’t the only automaker to express interest in eVTOL. Others, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226778/gm-flying-car-cadillac-halo-av-evtol-concept-autonomous-ces-2021"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt;, have also invested in prototypes and concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlSl0D"&gt;The aim of its robotics division is to develop “multi-fingered hands” that can pick up and grip certain objects. Honda is researching how to do this through remote operation, in which a human wearing a VR visor and a connected glove can operate the robotic hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OJCcy8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honda is a pioneer in the field of robotics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XIlc4"&gt;Honda is a pioneer in the field of robotics, having developed Asimo, one of the first robots to walk on two legs. The automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514134/honda-asimo-humanoid-robot-retire"&gt;ceased production of Asimo in 2018&lt;/a&gt; in order to focus on using the technology for more practical use cases in nursing and road transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylJnio"&gt;Honda envisions white collar using its “Avatar” robots with digital screens in place of a face to remotely attend meetings and even interact with physical objects. This will allow people to live where they choose without constraints of workplace obligations, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfAIWv"&gt;Lastly, Honda is hoping to put its work propulsion, guidance, and control technologies to work on a “reusable rocket” program, Frommer said. The automaker started developing rocket technology in 2019, he added. “If we can use such rockets to launch small low orbit satellites, we can expect to evolve our core technologies into various services, including connected services,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3uAEa"&gt;How successful any of these research projects will be remains to be seen. The auto industry is going through a huge shift right now, with most of the major companies vowing to phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of electric ones. Honda is no different, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;vowing to stop selling internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040&lt;/a&gt;. This will be an incredibly costly project, and risky too, as consumers in the US have been slow to adopt electrification. &lt;/p&gt;
