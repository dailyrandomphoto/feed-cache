    <title>Virgin Galactic to send its first sweepstakes winner to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virgin Galactic Spaceship Two Feathering" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmgsBTcoQCelKp-T6q7IjpzUcHo=/0x15:640x442/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188780/spaceshiptwo-feathering.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wTBMgF"&gt;On Wednesday, Virgin Galactic announced its first sweepstakes winner that the space tourism company is sending to space. The winner, Keisha S. (her last name is being withheld by the company), is a health coach from Antigua and Barbuda. She will be the first person from the Caribbean islands to visit space and hopes to bring her daughter, who studies astrophysics, on the spacecraft with her as her guest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKrTIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ElMnz"&gt;“I’ve always had a lifelong love of flying and a fascination with space,” Keisha said in a press release. “This is truly a dream come true for me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i98Bto"&gt;The sweepstakes was done in partnership with Omaze, a fundraising company, and Space for Humanity, a nonprofit that wants to ensure an inclusive future in space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgfVao"&gt;Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572643/virgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; to raffle two seats on its spacecraft in July following a successful launch and return of its Unity 22 mission that sent Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;founder Richard Branson to space&lt;/a&gt;. More than a hundred thousand people donated to the sweepstakes, which drew in a projected $1.7 million in eight weeks following its kick-off in July, according to Virgin Galactic. Proceeds will benefit Space for Humanity and &lt;a href="https://spaceforhumanity.org/?locale=en"&gt;its Citizen Astronaut Program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CFHY2G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Virgin Galactic successfully sends Richard Branson to the edge of space","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ukHyyx"&gt;2021 saw the beginning of a new era of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;private and civilian space missions. The first batch of civilians has been notable for their extreme wealth, including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Virgin Galactic’s Branson. Many more private individuals are shelling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770864/virgin-galactic-q3-earnings-2021-tickets-700-customers"&gt;hundreds of thousands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/12/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-auctions-spaceflight-seat-for-28-million.html"&gt;to millions&lt;/a&gt; of dollars to reserve a seat on a future flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYSSEz"&gt;But companies and wealthy space tourists have also been making efforts to bring along those who can’t afford the trips on their own. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681339/spacex-inspiration4-crew-return-earth-splashdown"&gt;SpaceX’s&lt;/a&gt; Inspiration4 space flight included billionaire funder Jared Isaacman and three other individuals, who Issacman bought tickets for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Qlg8U8"&gt;In addition to winning a ticket to space,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Keisha also won a tour of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico. There is no word yet on when her trip will take place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Alarm Pro review: all you need to start a smart home</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Ring has built the perfect smart home hub for most people... just not for me&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k4P9NT"&gt;I am a big fan of Ring Alarm. Mainly because the inexpensive, easy-to-use security system is an excellent smart home hub in disguise. Since the first generation of the product launched in 2018, it’s been packed with useful smart home radios, including Bluetooth, RF, cellular, Zigbee, and Z-Wave, some of which are capable of connecting to a nice selection of smart home and security devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVDD2m"&gt;I also admire Ring Alarm for leading the charge in disrupting the tired, expensive home security industry, thanks to its rock bottom prices, good hardware, and lack of long-term contracts. So, I’ve been watching the evolution of this product with interest over the last few years, waiting for the moment Ring finally united its smart home and home security offerings in this powerful piece of tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea4cQ1"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HSRZ58F/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08HSTJPM5_toAsin_B08HSRZ58F?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt; ($249 for the base station, $299 for a starter kit) the company has done just that. This is the ultimate smart home hub: in addition to the security capabilities of the previous model, there’s now a built-in Eero mesh router for better Wi-Fi in your home, an LTE radio for whole-home internet backup, USB type-C connections for external battery backup, a Ring Lighting bridge to connect your smart lighting, and a microSD card slot for local storage and processing of video. But they still haven’t turned on that Zigbee radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yq09q5"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro is the next level of smart home security, a near-perfect marriage of everything you need to set up a smart home and then some, all for under $300. But it has one significant flaw that means if you already have a substantial smart home setup, you’ll want to give it a pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AdHT97"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10884707"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wfthpL"&gt;It makes a lot of sense for Amazon to marry its leading smart security hardware brand with its excellent consumer-level mesh Wi-Fi company. The chief complaint I hear about Ring is the poor connectivity of its cameras and video doorbells — something often solved by adding better Wi-Fi in the home. The inclusion of an Eero 6 router makes the Ring Alarm an excellent solution for homeowners who want a security system with cameras and are still using their ISP-supplied combined router and modem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEYhKM"&gt;If you already have a capable mesh Wi-Fi setup and a substantial number of smart home devices — this is not the hub for you. That’s mainly because the Ring Alarm Pro has to be the gateway device for your home Wi-Fi, and for some setups (including my own), the included Eero 6 dual-band router is just not powerful enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swi53P"&gt;This means I have to forgo local storage of Ring videos, 24/7 whole-home internet backup, and 30-plus hours of continuous power to keep my cameras, security system, heck, even Netflix online when the power goes out. This makes me sad, as I want all these things. If only Ring had put an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Eero Pro 6 router&lt;/a&gt; in the Ring Alarm Pro (it’s even in the name!), this would have been the perfect device, albeit a significantly more expensive one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ou7yDkSCz598UJugArUTB9gYo0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040652/jtuohy_211108_4886_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro has the option of a Power Pack that provides an additional 8 hours of battery back-up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9oS0m"&gt;But instead, the Ring Alarm Pro is slightly less than pro. The Eero 6, which is capable of speeds up to 900Mbps over 1,500 square feet, is just fine for most people, but if you have gigabit internet service or a significant number of devices on your network — based on my experience, anything over 50 — it’s not going to be able to handle them. This seems like poor planning on Ring’s part, as surely the idea is to get people to buy more Ring and Ring-compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDD9Nq"&gt;Ring also opted not to include Thread in its base station, despite it being in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;almost every other Eero device&lt;/a&gt;. “We may enable Zigbee on Ring Alarm Pro in the future,” Nick Weaver, CEO of Eero, told me. “If a customer wants Zigbee Smart Home Hub or Thread support today, they can add an Eero 6 router or any Eero Pro 6 device to their network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dhmpk0"&gt;I have over 100 devices connected to my network, and it needs a tri-band router like Eero’s Pro 6 to handle the traffic. While you can add an Eero Pro 6 to a Ring Alarm Pro setup — the Ring Alarm has to be the gateway device, it can’t be an extender, or you won’t get the 24/7 backup features for your whole network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="PJTsK3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One attempt to set up the Ring Alarm Pro blew up my aging AT&amp;amp;T Arris modem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O3GDyW"&gt;After a few false starts getting my existing network of smart home devices onto the Ring Alarm Pro’s Eero network (including one attempt that blew up my aging AT&amp;amp;T Arris modem), I finally got running, only to find my network behaving like molasses in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vHZNJ"&gt;A call with Eero concluded that the Ring Alarm Pro wasn’t going to work for my network because I have so many devices on it. The best solution for testing the system was to put my existing Eero Pro 6 Wi-Fi mesh network back online, create a new network in the Eero app using the Ring Alarm Pro as the Gateway, and connect that to my ISP via one of the Eero Pro 6 routers’ ethernet ports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMV49RGQYCId93lWmt7mVX2dhkA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040653/jtuohy_211108_4886_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Extras you may need with your Ring Alarm Pro include an additional Eero extender ($89), a Ring Power Pack ($130) and a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85wjzO"&gt;This setup went smoothly, and I easily reconnected the Ring cameras I was testing to this new network and a second Eero 6 extender to it for more coverage. The Ring Alarm sensors I had already connected to the Ring Alarm Pro also transferred over with no hiccups. Everything ran smoothly — confirming my theory that this could be the perfect smart home hub for a lot of people, just not for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuNGOw"&gt;So, who is this for? If you have an existing Ring Alarm setup, it’s a good upgrade. You can purchase the Pro base station separately for $250 and swap out your old base station after performing a backup of your system in the Ring app. I tested this process, and it was easy and quick. You should consider this if you want to add a mesh Wi-Fi router to your home (or already have an Eero 6 running and need more coverage), are thinking about getting some outdoor Ring lighting (it doubles as a Ring lighting bridge, which costs $50), are interested in local storage for your Ring cameras, and / or want backup internet for when the internet goes down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cdvil0"&gt;If you are starting a smart home from scratch and / or looking to get an alarm system and mesh Wi-Fi network, the Ring Alarm Pro eight-piece starter kit for $299.99 is a good option. You get the base station, four door / window contact sensors, a motion detector, a keypad, and a Z-Wave range extender (which extends the Z-Wave signal to reach any sensors that might be out of range of the base station). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJIuZw"&gt;Ring’s security hardware is excellent — the motion sensors and door / window sensors are slimmer and more functional than those that came with the first-gen model. They are also pre-paired to the base station and have pre-affixed double-sided tape — making setup and installation a cinch. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfb5-q8XLzNOUrG4AfDBMjWpEBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040650/jtuohy_211108_4886_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro eight-piece set comes with the base station (not pictured), four contact sensors, a motion sensor, a Z-Wave range extender and a keypad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jrag3B"&gt;The keypad is simple to use, with nice, big buttons including panic buttons that will alert your emergency contacts and dispatch police, fire or medical assistance (if you have professional monitoring). It’s easy to find a good spot for it, thanks to a battery that will last up to six months and a mounting bracket that attaches to the wall or doubles as a tabletop stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of9tK9"&gt;The new Pro base station is chunkier, powered by a USB Type-C cable, and has to be hardwired to your modem, a change from the previous models that can work over Wi-Fi or wired connections. It can still be wall-mounted, but that’s not a good option if you want to use the new Ring Power Pack for longer backup, which connects via a short USB-C cable and sits under the base station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3xVQk"&gt;In my testing, all the sensors responded reasonably promptly and accurately, triggering the alarm within two to four seconds. A push alert is sent to your phone, and if you pay for professional monitoring, Ring’s service will call you first before dispatching emergency services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHIGAs"&gt;Unsurprisingly, Ring integrates very well with Amazon’s Alexa, and can be set as the default security system for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622968/alexa-guard-amazon-echo-security-how-to-get"&gt;Alexa Guard&lt;/a&gt;, which turns your Echo speakers into security sensors that can listen for the sound of glass breaking or smoke alarms going off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzwMMsHZcdJD3JzGDOtYVaIZr8o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040660/jtuohy_211122_4886_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The motion sensor and contact sensor are small and unobtrusive, but the prominent Ring logo is annoying. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSTe7YzgneYGqXs5Y7PjyVhFsZk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040658/jtuohy_211122_4886_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The contact sensor attaches to doors and windows and can work as a trigger for Alexa Routines.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-uEP5xhGvzTDDjYeeu45GIVSJdk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040659/jtuohy_211122_4886_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z-Wave extender plugs into an outlet to help more distant sensors communicate with the base station. It is not a Wi-Fi extender.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXq9cvfo0UADOTpEMufCgkbGSjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040661/jtuohy_211122_4886_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keypad lets you arm and disarm without the app, you can add multiple keypads to the system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBFtyu"&gt;Ring’s sensors can also be used as triggers for Alexa smart home Routines; you can have them turn on lights when motion is detected or make an announcement when a contact sensor opens. I set one up to say, “Your daughter is trying to sneak out,” through the Echo speaker in my bedroom if her bedroom window opens after 9PM (she’s 10, so this is actually not an issue… yet). These ran promptly, but not instantly, taking between three and five seconds to activate after the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="visOnJ"&gt;The Home, Away, and Disarmed Modes in the Ring App make the system simple to operate, and you can tie it to Alexa Guard to have it set when you say, “Alexa, I’m leaving.” There’s an option to disarm with voice, too, using a pin code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9C8d3h"&gt;If you don’t have an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Echo speaker,&lt;/a&gt; you will have to set the alarm manually in the app, on the keypad, or turn on geofencing in the app to send you a reminder when you leave home or arrive back. Another option is to create a schedule in the app to set the alarm to turn on at night and off in the morning (or whenever you choose). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tWF4PTsWupX5p8Sy6leAZgIIubw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040657/jtuohy_211115_4886_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro has two ethernet ports, a MicroSD card slot, and a USB type-C connector for power. To connect it to a Power Pack you use a color-coded USB Type-C cable. You need to charge the Power Pack with the base station’s cable first, as it doesn’t have its own power supply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="USL15c"&gt;All of the above comes with any Ring Alarm system, but with the Pro, you also get local processing and storage of videos generated by connected Ring cameras and 24/7 internet backup. The local video storage is called Ring Edge, and you need to install a microSD card for it to work (a 64GB can hold around 47 hours of clips and you can use cards up to 512GB). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jhdbe"&gt;In testing, this function worked smoothly, producing marginally quicker response times (2- to 3-second difference) when pulling up a live view or viewing recorded footage, but nothing significantly faster. The main reason to use this is if you don’t want your videos stored in the cloud. You still have to pay the monthly Ring Protect Plus fee to use Ring Edge, though, so it’s not going to save you any money (another reason for choosing cameras with local storage). Ring Edge currently works with the Ring Stickup Cam, Indoor Cam, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;Ring Pro 2 doorbell&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u5pJF1DFH4PFcq_DYSsfOYmWzqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23040147/Ring_Alarm_Pro_screenshots.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshots by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You manage the Ring Alarm Pro’s extra features such as video storage, cellular data, and backup power in the Ring app (left two images). The Eero Wi-Fi network is controlled in the Eero app (right two images), where you can select which devices on your network should use Ring’s LTE backup internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JoHtu5"&gt;The Ring Alarm Pro is the only consumer device in this category to offer 24/7 internet backup. Most professionally monitored security systems, including the original Ring Alarm, have cellular and battery backup to keep the hub up if the power or internet goes out, but this extends that backup capability to devices on your network, too. You can set it up to keep things like your smart thermostat, smart speakers, and smart lights online in the event of an internet outage, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3XnzK"&gt;In my testing, it worked very well, switching over to LTE immediately when I disconnected the ethernet cable and serving up speeds of 18Mbps despite a weak connection to AT&amp;amp;T at my house (the service the Pro uses for its cellular connection). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECTSOo"&gt;While it’s not fast enough to keep watching 4K video or continue playing Fortnite on my son’s Xbox, it was enough to keep the Ring cameras up and let me do some work on my laptop. You can choose in the Eero and Ring apps which devices get to take advantage of the 3GB LTE included in your monthly subscription, and you can pay for extra data at $3 per gigabyte, if necessary. Managing the Wi-Fi network is done in the Eero app; that functionality isn’t built into the Ring app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YPTqbK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ring’s sensors can be used as triggers for Alexa Routines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o77Bcd"&gt;To really get the benefits of internet backup, though, you need to buy one or more (up to four) Ring Power Packs. These each provide up to eight hours of battery backup — keeping you online if the internet and the power go out. I tested one power pack, and along with the LTE, it kept my network up for the better part of a day. I was able to pull up live views from the Ring cameras, see past footage, view a live feed on an Echo Show, and control the alarm system with no lagging, hiccups, or any issues at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twHqV9"&gt;But the Power Packs cost $130 each, so to get the max offline uptime, you’re looking at an outlay of $770 upfront; $520 for four Power Packs, plus $250 for the Pro base station. This adds up quickly, as does the price hike for the Ring Protect plans. The previous plan that included professional monitoring was $10 a month or $100 a year, and came with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454582/amazon-alexa-guard-plus-subscription-service-security-price-release-date"&gt;Alexa Guard Plus&lt;/a&gt; (worth $4.99 a month), and 60 days of cloud storage for any connected Ring cameras. The new plan is now $20 a month (or $200 a year) and includes all of the above, plus LTE data for the backup internet, an Eero Secure subscription that provides ad filtering, malware protection, content filters, and parental controls, and the option to store footage from your Ring cameras locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLex11"&gt;Essentially, the Ring Alarm Pro costs more than twice as much as the original if you take full advantage of its extra features. It’s still an incredibly good value for what you get, especially compared to other professionally monitored security services that run $25 per month or more and don’t offer nearly as many features. You can use the Pro without a monthly subscription, but all you are really getting is a mesh Wi-Fi router and a self-monitored alarm system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="dmxTCM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10883117"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="66GOJ2"&gt;Compared to the competition, Ring still offers the best value. Wyze’s security system is cheaper upfront and for the monthly cost but has fewer features and accessories. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/9/7/17828782/security-system-self-installed-easy-installation-set-up"&gt;Simplisafe&lt;/a&gt; is more expensive to buy and run and only works with Simplisafe’s limited number of smart devices. Only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/21/18191341/homekit-gateway-z-wave-zigbee-nest-google-alexa-abode"&gt;Abode&lt;/a&gt; offers a similar system for an equally good price, and it’s the better choice if you want integration with a platform outside of Alexa (it works with Google Home and HomeKit). It’s also a Z-Wave hub with wider compatibility than Ring’s, but it has fewer camera options and doesn’t have internet backup or local storage of videos. Abode does offer 24/7 continuous video recording, which Ring does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6r3wl"&gt;The Ring Alarm is an excellent product that will work well for its target audience while locking them firmly into the Ring / Amazon / Eero ecosystem. While Ring does integrate with other devices (you can connect a Chamberlain smart garage door opener, a Level smart door lock, and a Honeywell Home thermostat to the Ring app, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Ring/Ring/page/77B53039-540E-4816-BABB-49AA21285FCF"&gt;among other options&lt;/a&gt;), it’s a carefully curated list and actual integration is limited. There is also no compatibility with other platforms outside Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4jqb0"&gt;This is a good security system that makes it easy for someone to build out their smart home without being bothered about too much choice. I completely understand this approach while completely disagreeing with it. Yes, we want to make it easier and less confusing for people to use connected products in their homes. But the walled garden approach is not the right one, as it limits choice and access to features and services, which ultimately makes for a less useful smart home experience. Further compounding that problem is Ring’s hesitancy to commit to Matter support in the future, which would solve a lot of the ecosystem limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dRAYhs"&gt;Mostly, however, I’m sad because I want to use this product, but the Ring Alarm Pro’s current approach is just not pro enough for me. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on cameras and lenses </title>

  &lt;p id="CTXPBN"&gt;Cameras and lenses can be a tricky thing to shop for around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;. They are no small investment, though if you’re shopping for that lucky someone — or for yourself — there are some deals to be had that can save you a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd0NVO"&gt;We have vetted and rounded up the most notable deals from the major camera manufacturers, focusing on the latest mirrorless systems. It’s hard to justify spending big money on a new DSLR in 2021, as it may be better to look to the secondhand market for those older systems. Another hard truth is that some camera manufacturers have been plagued by the chip shortages on the latest models, and the deals on tap show that — many of the deeper discounts are on slightly older cameras, and some newer releases have no discounts at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="urMZzu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021: news, deal highlights, and money-saving tips","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"},{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for creators","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746670/holiday-gift-ideas-2021-creators-content-artists-tech-gadgets-creative"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="WwH8Cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10884903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mOqINq"&gt;Canon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qmviZk"&gt;Canon’s latest full-frame EOS R5 is hard to get, and its new R3 has still not hit the market yet. The best Black Friday deals from the market leader are on its older full-frame EOS R and RP cameras. They are still fine options in 2021, especially with a $200 discount across multiple models and configurations, though the R3, R5, and R6 have stolen all the buzz in the Canon world since they cater to more advanced enthusiasts and pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="23Buj6"&gt;The EOS R was the first full-frame mirrorless camera from Canon. It has a 30-megapixel sensor and has received big improvements to its eye-tracking autofocus through firmware, as Canon has released more native RF-mount lenses over the last three years since its release. You can get the body only for $1,599 ($200 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Mirrorless-Digital-Camera-Body/dp/B07H484HLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1433710-REG%2Fcanon_eos_r_mirrorless_digital.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792032%2Fcamera-deals-black-friday-2021-mirrorless-slr-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcar.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf34R3f8wBK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="yfcc0j"&gt;Canon’s EOS RP is the lower-cost sibling to the EOS R. For the body only, it currently costs $899 (a savings of $100) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Full-frame-Interchangeable-lightweight-3380C132/dp/B07N9KDCGV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1459282-REG%2Fcanon_eos_rp_mirrorless_digital.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792032%2Fcamera-deals-black-friday-2021-mirrorless-slr-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fcarp.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf37jcbN5DH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="Ae1wUW"&gt;The smaller APS-C sensor-equipped EOS M50 Mark II Content Creator Kit comes with the camera, EF-M 15-45mm f/3.5-6.3 IS STM lens, tripod grip, and external mic for just $799 ($100 off) at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1631224-REG%2Fcanon_4728c052_eos_m50_mark_ii.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792032%2Fcamera-deals-black-friday-2021-mirrorless-slr-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Ficam50m2ck.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf342h0u9kp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0N7lc"&gt;Canon’s ultra-portable EOS M200 Content Creator Kit comes with the same 15-45mm lens and tripod grip for just $499 ($150 off) at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512531-REG%2Fcanon_3699c043_eos_m200_mirrorless_digital.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792032%2Fcamera-deals-black-friday-2021-mirrorless-slr-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UsUr9m"&gt;Only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/0e48c839?showVariations=true&amp;amp;ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_44_0e48c839_dt_sl7_22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some Canon RF and EF-M lenses are on discount&lt;/a&gt;, though some notables include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-35mm-1-8-Macro-Lens/dp/B07H4SFG4G?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off the RF 35mm f/1.8 IS Macro STM&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-M-22mm-Compact-System/dp/B008NF8BRI?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 off the EF-M 22mm f/2 STM&lt;/a&gt; lens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5K72es"&gt;Sony&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VidIKI"&gt;Sony has been taking the mirrorless world by storm thanks to its relentless pace of technological improvements and frequent model revisions. Though its big-league &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22545402/sony-alpha-1-a1-mirrorless-camera-review-specs-price-features-test" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A1 camera&lt;/a&gt; has also seen more than its fair share of shipment delays, and it’s possible the hotly anticipated A7IV might share a similar fate. For now, there are some solid Black Friday deals to peruse on items that are readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="VkLLF0"&gt;The Sony A7R IVA has enough resolution to be a dedicated landscape and studio camera, but its fast autofocus and burst shooting allow it to work in just about any demanding scenarios. Normally $3,498 for the body only, you can now pick it up on an early Black Friday deal for $2,998 ($500 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Mirrorless-Interchangeable-Resolution-Continuous/dp/B0973H3N8V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1645238-REG%2Fsony_ilce7rm4a_b_alpha_a7r_iv_mirrorless.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792032%2Fcamera-deals-black-friday-2021-mirrorless-slr-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7r4nfl.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf345lGkcOt" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fisoa7r4nfl.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; is even including one of its house-brand hot shoe flashes (equivalent to Godox) at the same price.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p id="c4Cyiv"&gt;Nikon has been hit hard by the chip shortage, with scarce availability of its latest Z6 II, Z7 II, and vintage-inspired Z fc cameras in the market. However, its lower-cost Z5 camera is arguably one of the best values throughout all cameras during this Black Friday season. The Z5 and older Z6 are discounted by $400, and each offers a lot of camera for the money, even if the Z6 is a bit long in the tooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="xQ159y"&gt;The Nikon Z5 is a compact body that ticks most boxes for enthusiasts. It has a nice EVF and even squeezes in dual-SD card slots.

&lt;li id="W56S08"&gt;The more modest APS-C sensor of the Nikon Z50 is a smaller, more cost-effective option. Though for Black Friday, the only configuration currently on sale is a two-lens kit with the Nikkor Z DX 16-50mm f/3.5-6.3 VR and Nikkor Z DX 50-250mm f/4.5-6.3 VR lens for  $1,197 ($150 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nikon-Compact-Mirrorless-Digital-Vlogger/dp/B07YX8FX9Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnkz50k2.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBFcameras2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bTZMyM"&gt;Fujifilm&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fKgypU"&gt;Black Friday deals are not the most numerous for Fujifilm, as fan favorites like the X100V are not just full price but backordered just about everywhere. The latest version of the X-T line gets a nice discount, however, and an older medium format holdout hits a new low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="dD5SWo"&gt;The Fujifilm X-T4 premiered in early 2020 with one of its most significant changes, in-body image stabilization. That addition, plus a fold-out screen, made the X-T4 a prominent quality-of-life upgrade over its predecessor.

&lt;p id="k65XpC"&gt;The Panasonic Lumix offerings for Black Friday have nice discounts on micro four-thirds cameras like the video-centric GH5 II and the entry-level G95 hitting a new all-time low. On the full-frame front, the Netflix-approved S1H is $500 off, and the S5 offers the best bang for your buck if you want to go full-frame with Panasonic and L-Mount Alliance lenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KekGnp"&gt;Panasonic refreshed the Lumix GH5 II recently while it prepares a more robust GH6 for a future release.

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From Alexa to Google, the best smart displays to buy right now&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="EEElEl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Friday is nearly here and unsurprisingly, there are a lot of deals to find on smart displays. Amazon, Google, and Facebook are discounting their popular models, and you can find the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789311/black-friday-2021-smart-home-tech-speakers-cameras-cyber-monday"&gt;&lt;em&gt;full list of smart home deals here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Be sure to also check out our list of the best &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;early Black Friday deals available now&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6u20Q"&gt;Smart displays, those cousins of voice-controlled smart speakers with full touchscreen displays, are great devices for managing your smart home, displaying useful bits of information throughout the day, or even playing music or video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JMn4b"&gt;Like a smart speaker, a smart display is primarily voice-controlled, so you can bark commands at it from across a room. But unlike a smart speaker, a smart display can display information such as upcoming appointments, weather, in-progress timers, the current time, a grocery list, recipes, and more without you having to utter a single command. They can also be used as a modern, cloud-connected digital photo frame, allowing you to see all of those memories you’ve captured over the years that are currently trapped on your smartphone. Some models also come with built-in cameras that can be used for video calling to other smart displays or even phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67gXUF"&gt;The best smart display has all of the capabilities of the best smart speakers, including good-sounding speakers of its own for listening to music or watching video. They are available in a variety of prices and sizes, and depending on where you want to put the display in your home, you might prefer a smaller model over one that has a larger screen and louder speakers. If you’re looking for an all-around smart display to use in your kitchen or living room, you’ll want one with a screen that’s easy to see from across the room and speakers that can fill the space with clear, pleasant sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Qd1R"&gt;There are essentially two types of smart displays available: ones that use Amazon’s Alexa assistant and ones that run on Google Assistant. Which one is better for you really depends on your needs and whether you already have a smart speaker in your home. The two platforms are more similar than they are different, but a simple way to differentiate between them is Google’s smart displays work best with Google services, such as Duo, Photos, other Nest devices, and YouTube, and Amazon’s smart displays work with Amazon services, like Prime Video, Amazon Photos, and Ring products. For most people, the best option is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743409769677447969#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, depending on which virtual assistant you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qTt4ks"&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PQrAAX"&gt;Best smart displays 2021&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RB1ITB"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FVSF73"&gt;The best Alexa smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="Z0E8T9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609443" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUKydh"&gt;The Echo Show 8 is the middle child in Amazon’s lineup of Alexa-powered smart displays, and it’s the best Alexa smart display. It has a bright 8-inch touchscreen, two powerful speakers that can put out a surprising level of volume, a built-in camera with a privacy shutter, and four microphones to hear voice commands. It doesn’t take up a ton of space on a counter, mantle, or bookshelf, but it can easily be seen or controlled from across a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKoMBv"&gt;The Show 8 has access to all of the same Alexa abilities as Amazon’s Echo speakers, but it includes a number of unique things that take advantage of its built-in display. You can see timers on the screen without having to ask for them, recipes are displayed with step-by-step instructions and video tutorials, grocery lists are shown right on the screen, and the Show will cycle through upcoming calendar appointments, weather reports, and news headlines whenever it’s idle. The screen can also be used to pull up feeds from video doorbells and security cameras or to view the feed from another Echo Show in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GkxBr"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 has a 13-megapixel camera that can be used for video calls through Amazon’s Alexa calling (to phones or other Echo Show displays) or Zoom. It is able to automatically pan and crop to keep you in the frame, and it generally has good image quality. The built-in privacy shutter allows you to block the camera’s view if you don’t want to make video calls or want to use it in a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8Jlno6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 8 (second gen) review: a little faster, a little better camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="x2a4xS"&gt;Since the display is a full touchscreen, you can also interact with the Echo Show 8 without having to use your voice at all, including canceling timers, controlling smart home devices, or scrolling through photos stored in Amazon Photos or Facebook albums. But the Show 8 is not designed to be an iPad-like tablet, and its interactivity is limited to simple functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okSTsA"&gt;Like Echo speakers, the Show 8 can play audio and music from a variety of sources, including Spotify, Audible, Pocket Casts, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Sirius XM. It can also play video from Amazon’s Prime Video, Hulu, and Netflix. But it doesn’t have an easy way to play YouTube video (you have to go through the device’s built-in web browser, a very clumsy process), nor does it have the ability to play HBO Max or Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4wAMPU"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YNUQyb"&gt;The best Google Assistant smart display&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="MYAev1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625445" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wTRK50"&gt;If you are fully invested in Google’s ecosystem or own a lot of Nest products already, the Google Nest Hub is the best smart display with Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKXHYw"&gt;A 7-inch smart display, the Nest Hub is a little smaller than the Echo Show 8 and fits more comfortably on a nightstand. Its best feature is a screen that automatically adjusts itself for the lighting in your room, so it almost looks like photos are printed on paper instead of being displayed on a screen. Combine that with Google Photos’ excellent automatic backups and smart albums that can automatically update the Nest Hub with new images whenever you take them, and you have perhaps the best digital photo frame experience you can get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgQI1c"&gt;The latest, second-generation Nest Hub is also able to automatically track your sleep when it’s on a nightstand, making it an ideal smart alarm clock. It also lacks a camera entirely, which every other smart display in this list includes. That means you can’t use it for video calling, but it also means you don’t have to worry about a connected camera being in your most intimate of areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2Apou8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub (2nd-gen) review: sleep on it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Obc10t"&gt;The Nest Hub has a single speaker, which is much less powerful and doesn’t sound nearly as good as the Echo Show 8’s dual-speaker system. The 7-inch screen is also noticeably smaller, which makes it harder to see from across a room and less comfortable to watch video on. But if you watch a lot of YouTube or are a YouTube TV customer, the Nest Hub does a much better job of displaying those services than Amazon’s options. Google also supports more video services than Amazon on its smart displays, including Disney Plus and Paramount Plus. You can also easily cast video content from a variety of apps on your phone, such as HBO Max, to the Nest Hub display, which you can’t do with an Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e57UYw"&gt;Like an Echo Show, the Nest Hub can be used to control smart home devices, display upcoming appointments, step-by-step recipes, or voice-controlled timers and alarms. Google Assistant is generally better at answering random fact-based questions than Alexa, but for everyday tasks, they are very similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NWMx8D"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen)&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MxM2OV"&gt;The best Alexa smart display for a bedroom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="CeMKuA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DbeQY"&gt;The Echo Show 5 is very similar to the Echo Show 8 but smaller. That makes it more ideal for a nightstand and the best Alexa smart display for your bedroom. It’s also the least expensive Echo Show model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh2NrA"&gt;The Show 5 only has a 5.5-inch screen, which isn’t as easy to see from across the room as larger models. It also only has a single speaker, which can get quite loud, but isn’t as good as the speaker systems in the bigger Echo Show devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Kb9g8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 5 (second gen) review: small screen, small updates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="p2jUVQ"&gt;The Echo Show 5 also doesn’t support as many video streaming services or video calling services, and its 2-megapixel built-in camera is much lower quality than the Echo Show 8 or 10’s cameras. Fortunately, it still includes the physical privacy shutter to block its view when you don’t want to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dlrt9"&gt;Where the Echo Show 5 really shines is on a nightstand or desk. If you’re using it as a smart alarm clock, you can tap on the top to snooze the alarm. On a desk, it works well for personal audio such as podcasts or to view feeds from a security camera or video doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gm2lYe"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock 2 with Google Assista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nt&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mPth1E"&gt;The best Google smart alarm clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="k4KD9l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxh83d"&gt;If you are looking for a smart alarm clock with Google Assistant, then the best option is the tiny Lenovo Smart Clock 2. The Smart Clock 2 has a 4-inch screen, no camera, and a small footprint, making it ideal for a nightstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj9wLb"&gt;The Smart Clock is capable of showing the time, weather, calendar appointments, and Google Photos albums, just like the larger Nest Hub displays. You can interact with the screen with either voice or touch, and there are buttons on top for controlling volume and a switch on the back for muting the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfDdKh"&gt;In addition, the Smart Clock 2 is available with a dock that can charge your phone wirelessly, which makes it an ideal nightstand companion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WnZYEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lenovo Smart Clock 2 review: a good dock with an okay clock","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PIGlOj"&gt;Though you can play all the same music services (Spotify, YouTube Music, etc.) through the Smart Clock, its small speaker doesn’t sound that great and doesn’t get very loud. It works for hearing Google Assistant voice responses and an alarm, but not for extended listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqjvT"&gt;In addition, you can tap the top of the Smart Clock to snooze an alarm, and there’s a USB port on the back that you can use to charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qZwK7s"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yX8aIx"&gt;The best Alexa smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="okDdym"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10362085" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TUHUo"&gt;Amazon’s biggest and most expensive smart display is the Echo Show 10. It’s the best option if you want an Amazon display for making video calls because it has a motorized base that can actually follow you as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaRZHX"&gt;The 13-megapixel camera on the Echo Show 10 is the same as on the second-generation Echo Show 8. But its automatic crop and pan modes are supercharged by the 10’s motorized base. You can stick it in the corner of your kitchen and easily carry on a video call as you move around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXbws3"&gt;In addition, the motorized base makes it easy to watch video or follow a recipe as you move around since it always attempts to face you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yphYyV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 10 review: Alexa’s next move","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BWDxf0"&gt;The Echo Show 10 also has a louder and better-sounding speaker system than the smaller models, and it can fill a room with music easier. You can also pair smart home devices such as lightbulbs and other sensors directly to it through the built-in Zigbee radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eM7hMP"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="AmL7sb"&gt;The best Google smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="2OgPBm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625470" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rqdNQ"&gt;The 10-inch Nest Hub Max is a lot like the Nest Hub, but bigger. It also has a camera, though, which can be used for video calling through Google Duo or Zoom, or as a home security camera when you’re away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdyD44"&gt;The Max’s camera can also automatically crop and pan to keep you in frame, though it lacks the fancy motorized base found on the Echo Show 10. The camera also recognizes who is using the Max and automatically provides relevant information, and supports basic play and pause controls through hand gestures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Qrm2JS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Nest Hub Max review: bigger screen, better sound, and a camera","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zkm8Xt"&gt;The Max also has a louder, better-sounding speaker system than the smaller Nest Hub, which makes it more suitable for larger rooms. It’s probably too big to really use in a bedroom or on a nightstand — for that, you’ll want to stick with the smaller options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l33CZN"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Portal Go&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdEmYr"&gt;The best smart display for video calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ymW2g8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10885053"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vvr7Fs"&gt;If you want a smart display specifically for making WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger calls, then the 10-inch Facebook Portal Go is your best option. It has a 13-megapixel camera that supports automatic panning and cropping, and it can be used for video calls on Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Zoom, Cisco WebEx, and other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1qY0o"&gt;The best part of the Go is its built-in battery, which lets you move it wherever is most comfortable to take video calls — you don’t have to be tethered to a power outlet like with other smart displays. The battery is rated to last up to five hours for video calls, which is surely enough for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IuNRX"&gt;The Portal Go has Alexa as well, making it an Echo Show alternative. But the Alexa integration isn’t quite as good, and it doesn’t support as many features as Amazon’s smart display. You can also use Facebook’s own voice commands for controlling the Portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CzOJUz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s new Portal Go is great for video calls, but not much else","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22732472/facebook-portal-go-10-inch-2021-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="F78XAK"&gt;You can listen to music services or watch streaming video on the Portal’s 10-inch display, but the sound quality isn’t quite as good as you get on the Echo Show 8 or 10. If Facebook support is the most important thing to you, however, the Portal Go is a good choice. Otherwise, stick with an Amazon Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPO1bd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSZWnb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s cheapest streaming box is this $15 Black Friday special for Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku LE, or is it SE?" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpcvxpdFtn4bxM-XOamn33z4FvI=/89x0:1412x882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188293/Roku_LE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Roku LE, or is it SE? | Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwBnDJ"&gt;Ever since it appeared as the original Netflix streaming box, Roku has delivered internet video via box, stick, or embedded TV software. However, for Black Friday this year, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/11/roku-announces-15-roku-le-streaming-player-exclusively-at/b0zwbcpp-1637005128"&gt;Roku is releasing its cheapest device&lt;/a&gt; that I can remember seeing, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-LE-HD-Streaming-Media-Player-with-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-and-Simple-Remote%2F982679870&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$15 Roku LE Streaming Player&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BgXGIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buying the remote by itself costs $15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4AVerZ"&gt;It’s a 1080p-only box that does exactly what you’d expect from a Roku player, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-LE-HD-Streaming-Media-Player-with-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-and-Simple-Remote%2F982679870&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it will only be available from Walmart.com today&lt;/a&gt; and in Walmart stores on the 26th. We don’t have detailed specs, but it’s the same box Roku &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201117005405/en/Roku-Announces-Limited-Edition-17-Roku-SE-Streaming-Player"&gt;offered last year on Black Friday for $17&lt;/a&gt;, which has been selling at Walmart for $30 or so ever since as the Roku SE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uQAi4O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals at Walmart","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1Op0pD"&gt;For Roku and Walmart, it doesn’t really matter where this box came from. Walmart gets a cheap box to promote its Black Friday sales online and in stores. Roku, meanwhile, double dips by using the attention to highlight holiday discounts on more expensive and more capable hardware in its lineup, and it inducts a few more of the users that provide, on average, $40 per month in revenue from advertising, commissions, and data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMMj3Y"&gt;Speaking of those discounts, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K is available for $29.99 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4kfQgFy1C" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-streaming-stick-hd-4k-hdr-streaming-media-player-with-long-range-wireless-and-voice-remote-with-tv-controls%2F-%2FA-52709600&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;) instead of the usual $49.99. The Roku Streambar is available for $79.99 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08G8JH836?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4kgVA5Cqp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-Streambar-4K-HD-HDR-streaming-media-player-premium-audio-all-in-one-includes-Roku-voice-remote-released-2020%2F268579096&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;), a $50 discount from its usual $129.99 price, and the same goes for a $15 Streaming Stick+ discount that brings its price to $29.99 (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4khLZm3eg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FRoku-Streaming-Stick-4K-Media-Player%2F300825724&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;). All of these prices are in place until December 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3Fnid"&gt;So is there any reason for you to keep an eye out for the $15 box if you’re doing some shopping on Friday? Not really. The Roku Premiere that can handle Apple AirPlay, 4K, and HDR is available for $19.99 through Saturday (&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Froku-premiere-hd-4k-hdr-streaming-media-player-with-simple-remote-and-premium-hdmi-cable%2F-%2FA-53968930&amp;amp;subid1=VergeRokuBF112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf4ki3v6YOC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), or you could even get a Roku Express for $10 more without any hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyOc41"&gt;&lt;em&gt;But&lt;/em&gt; if you also need a replacement IR remote, this Roku LE comes with the company’s latest model in the box (it doesn’t have voice control, but it swaps out the Vudu shortcut button for Apple TV Plus), and an individual remote &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11553901?sid=VergeRokuBF112421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roku.com%2Fproducts%2Faccessories%2Froku-simple-remote" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $15&lt;/a&gt; by itself anyway, plus you get another HDMI cable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Friday is causing toxic traffic jams at US ports and warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ports Of Los Angeles And Long Beach As Container Glut Eases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/johAOKQIVEK9GMtfkkII4vjNZgQ=/0x1:5765x3844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188272/1236627879.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California, U.S., on Tuesday, Nov. 16, 2021. | Bing Guan/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Holiday shopping and broken supply chains have made a pollution crisis worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EvbAKG"&gt;As millions of Americans rush to take advantage of Black Friday deals this weekend, the shopping spree will add to a pollution crisis unfolding at America’s ports. For months, broken supply chains have saddled port-side neighborhoods with more pollution than they normally endure. The holiday season will make things even worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFxnuP"&gt;The disaster is unfolding in spectacular fashion in Southern California, home to the busiest port complex in the western hemisphere (which includes the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach). Here, cargo ships have piled up offshore as the pandemic wreaks havoc on global supply chains. The traffic jam extends to inland distribution hubs that attract trucks, trains, and planes shuttling goods from warehouses to consumers’ doorsteps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z1okHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The disaster is unfolding in spectacular fashion in Southern California&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw5dkb"&gt;That all has consequences for people’s health. “We need these things off these ships, I understand that,” says Afif El-Hasan, a pediatrician and national spokesperson for the American Lung Association. “But it’s going to hurt the people around the [areas] these goods come through.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyEQ4F"&gt;There are a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-10-13/the-global-supply-chain-is-a-mess-what-does-that-mean-for-you"&gt;factors&lt;/a&gt; that wrecked global supply chains, but in short, there was a mismatch in supply and demand. The pandemic shuttered factories. Meanwhile, people started shopping more for home improvement projects and new hobbies they picked up during pandemic-induced lockdowns. In the US, the container ships ferrying those goods from Asia started piling up at ports. During the first three quarters of this year, the movement of containers in and out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach was &lt;a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-11/SPBP_Congestion_Anchorage_Emissions_Final.pdf"&gt;nearly 30 percent higher&lt;/a&gt; than during the same time period in 2019. By November, container ships were parking outside the Port of Los Angeles for an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/ships-keep-coming-pushing-u-s-port-logjam-and-waits-to-records"&gt;average of 17 days&lt;/a&gt; — more than twice as long as they were towards the start of the year.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That has literally led to tons more air pollution in the region because the ships run their auxiliary engines while idling offshore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uMkq1l"&gt;By early fall, those problems were compounded by retailers’ rush to haul in goods for the holidays. Each day in October, container ships at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach cumulatively pumped out 50 tons of nitrogen oxides a day — compared with 30 tons before the pandemic, according to estimates by the regulatory agency California Air Resources Board (CARB).&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Nitrogen oxides are &lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/nox.html"&gt;poisonous gases&lt;/a&gt; that can do &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/clean-air/outdoors/what-makes-air-unhealthy/nitrogen-dioxide"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt; to the lungs on their own and that react with volatile organic compounds in the air to produce smog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlwyMI"&gt;Container ships were also responsible for a half-ton more particle pollution per day in October relative to average pre-pandemic levels. That’s about as much particulate matter as 100 thousand diesel trucks would produce, according to CARB. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/particulate-matter-pm-basics"&gt;Particulate matter&lt;/a&gt;, which can include soot, smoke, or other particles, can harm the heart and lungs and has been &lt;a href="https://www3.epa.gov/region1/airquality/pm-human-health.html"&gt;tied to health risks&lt;/a&gt; that can lead to premature death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixi4oZ"&gt;Globally, air pollution from maritime shipping has been &lt;a href="https://theicct.org/blog/staff/silent-deadly-case-shipping-emissions"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to 60,000 premature deaths in a single year. Congestion at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2021 is enough to potentially trigger an additional 30 premature deaths from cardiopulmonary problems, Michael Benjamin, chief of the Division of Air Quality, Planning and Science at CARB, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="831PfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pollution travels inland&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Clphb1"&gt;Just like the cars, game consoles, clothing, and other goods that come off the ships, pollution travels inland. In Southern California, it blows downwind from ships and gets trapped in two connected bowls in the local geography. Those include a dip in the landscape surrounding the ports, which quickly transitions to bustling cities like Long Beach and San Pedro. The Port of Long Beach is nestled right next to the city’s West Side — which has historically been home to immigrant and refugee enclaves, including Latinx, Southeast Asian, and Pacific Islander communities. Long Beach and Los Angeles, together, top the American Lung Association’s 2021 &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of most smog-polluted cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfVWig"&gt;Winds also blow into the nearby “Inland Empire,” which sits in another topographic bowl that traps the ports’ air pollution. It’s an area encompassing San Bernardino and Riverside Counties — two counties consistently ranked with &lt;a href="https://www.lung.org/research/sota/key-findings/most-polluted-places"&gt;the worst smog&lt;/a&gt; in the US by the American Lung Association. While the region was initially considered an empire of &lt;a href="https://www.lamag.com/photo-essays-2/main-sqeeze-orange-revolutionized-california/"&gt;orange groves&lt;/a&gt; in the early 1900s, today, it’s more like an empire of warehouses. Online shopping, which became even &lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-great-consumer-shift-ten-charts-that-show-how-us-shopping-behavior-is-changing"&gt;more popular&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, has fueled the explosive growth of warehouses for retailers, including Amazon, the region’s biggest private-sector employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VZXCBc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10884636"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KOJG6m"&gt;The supply chain problems have only worsened a chronic pollution crisis for these communities. Census tracts in California with warehouses have significantly worse air pollution compared to similar areas without warehouses, according to research that’s under review for publication by Priyanka DeSouza, an assistant professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Colorado Denver. Most of that pollution comes from diesel trucks. Coinciding with the recent congestion at the ports, CARB also estimates an &lt;a href="https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-09/port_congestion_anchorage_locomotives_truck_emissions_final_%28002%29.pdf"&gt;uptick&lt;/a&gt; in truck emissions this year — on top of the additional ship pollution wafting over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fI7RRF"&gt;The holiday shopping season could exacerbate the pollution even further. “This is a time when warehouses are really flooded,” says Joaquin Castillejos, a community organizer for the nonprofit Center for Community Action and Environmental Justice (CCAEJ) who lives in Bloomington, an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County. “Workers work to their limit because they’re trying to move merchandise as fast as possible for the holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut6MWg"&gt;Before he got the job at CCAEJ, Castillejos worked in a warehouse that distributed Adidas shoes. While he’s not exposed to the same pollution now as he was when he worked at a warehouse, Castillejos is now worried about pollution from a new industrial warehouse and office complex &lt;a href="https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/2020120545/3"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; to be built about two blocks from his home. Bloomington, a majority-Hispanic community, already has a &lt;a href="https://ejscreen.epa.gov/mapper/"&gt;higher burden&lt;/a&gt; of smog and fine particulate pollution than 95 percent of census tracts in the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="36PJR5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Warehouses are really flooded”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k69U5I"&gt;“[The Inland Empire] is one of the biggest warehouse hotspots in the country, and it’s getting worse [because] more and more warehouses are being built there,” says DeSouza. There’s been even more demand for warehouse space during the pandemic as retailers look for more places to &lt;a href="https://12exx71wc3m46es1m3w8fvx1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/ElionPartners_iREOCMemberReport_Jun2020.pdf"&gt;store excess inventory&lt;/a&gt; in order to fulfill consumers’ expectations for fast delivery despite kinks in the supply chain. The worsening pollution crisis at warehouses, DeSouza says, underscores the need to electrify trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qqg1K2"&gt;El-Hasan, the pediatrician with the American Lung Association, is worried about the disproportionate toll that port and warehouse pollution is taking on the most vulnerable — especially during a pandemic of a coronavirus that preys on the lungs. Lower-income households near warehouses and ports are often more likely to walk or bike to get around or keep windows open because they lack air conditioning, which he says could expose them to more air pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VHXNL"&gt;Hold-ups at overseas factories and domestic ports have &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supply-chain-problems-show-signs-of-easing-11637496002"&gt;started to ease up&lt;/a&gt; some in the past few weeks, but supply chain woes are expected to persist well into 2022. In a catch-22, even efforts to ease those backlogs could be bad news for people living with port pollution. In mid-October, the Biden Administration moved to keep the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/10/13/fact-sheet-biden-administration-efforts-to-address-bottlenecks-at-ports-of-los-angeles-and-long-beach-moving-goods-from-ship-to-shelf/"&gt;open 24/7&lt;/a&gt;, alarming El-Hasan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pBmrVg"&gt;“So we don’t even get any lulls in the pollution,” he says. “There’s just going to be pollution there, nonstop, day and night, all the time.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new app helps get more out of the S21 Ultra’s telephoto cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy S21 Ultra, in Phantom Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qJnyCSn5m3S7Ijidglwvoi5Oymo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70188200/vpavic_210119_4377_0170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra’s four rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Azrgn"&gt;Samsung has released a new camera app in beta that lets you use Pro Mode across all four of the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear cameras. That means it’s supported on both telephoto cameras, rather than being limited to just its main and ultrawide sensors. The new &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/s21-ultra-%EC%B9%B4%EB%A9%94%EB%9D%BC-expert-raw-%EC%95%B1%EC%9D%98-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EB%A5%BC-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/14005849"&gt;Expert RAW app&lt;/a&gt; has been released in the South Korean Galaxy Store, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1463337169548832771?s=20"&gt;tipster FrontTron&lt;/a&gt; has an APK available to download if you’d like to sideload it. It only seems to be available for the S21 Ultra for now, on devices running Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCQS4w"&gt;The new app overcomes a limitation of the Galaxy S21 Ultra, which is that its stock camera’s Pro Mode is only available with two out of its four rear cameras (aka the 108-megapixel main camera and 12-megapixel ultrawide, but not the 10-megapixel 10x telephoto or 3x telephoto). &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/support/mobile-devices/using-pro-mode/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Mode&lt;/a&gt; is an advanced feature in the camera app that gives you manual control over shooting elements like ISO and shutter speed and lets you shoot in RAW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GKFEjQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Galaxy Expert RAW &lt;br&gt;APK: &lt;a href="https://t.co/RO8DXM0AWX"&gt;https://t.co/RO8DXM0AWX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lightroom Profile:&lt;a href="https://t.co/Nxq7ae4NF5"&gt;https://t.co/Nxq7ae4NF5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supported in S21U running Android 12 or above.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Linear DNG 16bit raw, Lossless JPEG, HDR, ISO, Shutter-Speed, EV, Manual Focus, White Balance, Histogram, UW, Wide, Tele(3x), Tele(10x) lens &lt;a href="https://t.co/6VSuDQo9tE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6VSuDQo9tE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tron ❂ (@FrontTron) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrontTron/status/1463337169548832771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fV3itJ"&gt;The app’s &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/s21-ultra-%EC%B9%B4%EB%A9%94%EB%9D%BC-expert-raw-%EC%95%B1%EC%9D%98-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EC%84%9C%EB%B9%84%EC%8A%A4%EB%A5%BC-%EC%86%8C%EA%B0%9C%ED%95%A9%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/14005849"&gt;announcement post&lt;/a&gt; says the Expert RAW app can shoot in lossless JPEG and 16-bit Linear DNG RAW formats. &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_launches_expert_raw_camera_app_for_galaxy_s21_ultra-news-51978.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; both produce images that benefit from multi-frame HDR processing, but that the latter offers the flexibility you get when editing a RAW image file. Just be sure to use an app like Lightroom to edit the DNG file because regular photo apps like Google Photos will strip out its HDR and other post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ4GVk"&gt;We’ve contacted Samsung for more information about the app, including when it might be made available for the S21 and S21 Plus or whether its features might eventually make their way into the stock Samsung app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8qbwNvRtOz3aWm0Swd3D9CY2VoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166146/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AirPods Pro with the MagSafe charging case are on sale for just $190 at Amazon. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

This particular model comes with a wired charging case, however, you can pick up a pair with the wireless charging case for $150 instead of $200 from &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nAbiSM"&gt;The 64GB, Wi-Fi version of the 10.9-inch iPad Air is selling for $539 instead of $600 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F149437127&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in rose gold, while the space gray version is just $10 extra.

Right now, you can buy the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM for $1,399 in gold or space gray at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604840-REG%2Fapple_z125_mgn7_04_bh_13_3_macbook_air_with.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x1080441%2FSID%2Fprice-guide&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22787892%2Fapple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

Right now, you can pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Retina-Display-27-inch-Storage/dp/B08F8ZPRGW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,799 when you choose the Core i5 model with 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

Amazon is also discounting various configurations of the latest version by $10, selling for example the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-TV-4K-32GB/dp/B0933D3SN6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB 2021 Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; for $170 instead of $179.&lt;/p&gt;

The stylus is compatible with the latest entry-level iPad and a range of earlier models, and it differs from the second-gen model in that you need to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port in order to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cPIw19"&gt;Apple AirTag deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YcyTlE"&gt;Apple is throwing in a $50 gift card when you buy a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-airtag/airtag/4-pack"&gt;four-pack of AirTags&lt;/a&gt; from them directly starting November 26th.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EIiXqs"&gt;Gamers are served up all kinds of great deals throughout the year. It’s not uncommon for recently released games to drop as much as 20 percent off in the first few months of release or to snag the occasional one-off deal on a controller or headset. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are something special — a chance to get in on the year’s best offers all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lUgdw"&gt;Like 2020, the holidays in 2021 are a bit peculiar, what with the ongoing pandemic and chip shortage. There’s no shortage of games and accessories, but fewer consoles are available for first-time buyers to gift, which means the opportunities to get one are very rare and very popular. Some retailers have even taken to charging subscription fees that offer you a boosted chance of getting a console, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22771984/ps5-restock-xbox-best-buy-walmart-amazon-subscription"&gt;even those aren’t a guarantee&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K39KBB"&gt;We’re splitting up this roundup by platform, so find the one you’re shopping for, and enjoy the deals. We also have a catch-all guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, if you happen to be shopping early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="75fFMI"&gt;Mobile deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZxQlt"&gt;For iPhone users, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1733403&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=107979&amp;amp;urllink=playbackbone%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone%2Done%2F&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGamingBFCM112421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can pick up the Backbone One controller for $15 off&lt;/a&gt; its usual price. Normally $100, it’s currently $85, and comes with a three-month trial to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. This controller works with its own app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;turning your iPhone into more of a gaming console&lt;/a&gt;. It’s compatible with a wide range of iPhones, however, make sure to check the box that says “Add iPhone 13 Pro &amp;amp; Pro Max Adapter,” if you own one of Apple’s latest that has a thicker camera array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="28bLOa"&gt;PlayStation 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2mGY8n"&gt;While you might not be able to find a PS5 console in time for the holidays (fingers are crossed for you, though), you can at least stock up on games and accessories that would normally cost you more than they do right now. Keep in mind that all of the deals below (with the exception of the digital games from the PlayStation Store) are the disc versions of the games, requiring the $500 PS5 console that has a disc drive.

&lt;h2 id="zk9YYz"&gt;Xbox Series S and Series X deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4jLmk9"&gt;Compared to PlayStation 4 and 5, Microsoft’s Xbox consoles have fewer first-party exclusives. But there’s a hidden trick up the Xbox’s sleeve: all of those first-party games that you might normally pay $60 or $70 for are tucked behind a monthly subscription Game Pass Ultimate (of course, you can still pay full price for games if you want). There are still great deals below, but check out Game Pass for the full scope of what’s available for your Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox sues YouTuber for temporarily shutting down conference with fake terrorist threat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ig5dXzQkbXV8J00GtH1ibJpcfVI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70187916/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c0MuBM"&gt;Game and social platform Roblox has sued a YouTube creator it banned from the platform over harassment and sexual content, saying he amassed a “mob” that temporarily shut down its October developers conference. The Roblox Corporation &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F542082247%2FRoblox-vs-Ruben-Sim-lawsuit%3Fcampaign%3DSkimbitLtd%26ad_group%3D66960X1516586X1b00420ae5c25d258b51cfae330ca18b%26keyword%3D660149026%26source%3Dhp_affiliate%26medium%3Daffiliate%23from_embed%26referrer%3Dpolygon.com%26sref%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F22799362%2Froblox-sues-banned-cybermob-leader-for-terrorizing-the-platform-its-developers%26xcust%3D___pl__p_22563403__m_social__s_twitter__t_w__c_pol&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F24%2F22800526%2Froblox-lawsuit-benjamin-robert-simon-ruben-sim-harassment-rdc-shutdown-terrorism" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Benjamin Robert Simon, also known as Ruben Sim, for breaching its user contract and violating anti-hacking laws. “Defendant Simon is the leader of a ‘cybermob’ that with malice, fraud, and oppression, commits and encourages unlawful acts designed to injure Roblox and its users,” the suit claims, seeking $1.65 million in damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoA4OJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22799362/roblox-sues-banned-cybermob-leader-for-terrorizing-the-platform-its-developers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;initially reported&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the California lawsuit this morning. In it, Roblox says it banned Simon for attempting to upload a near-nude picture of himself, images of Adolf Hitler, and a “sex game” that’s forbidden on the kid-focused platform. Simon also allegedly harassed other members of the platform, used racial and homophobic slurs, and impersonated Roblox employees online, among other behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQe1r"&gt;After the ban, the suit says he continued accessing Roblox using fake accounts, evading bans on his hardware and IP addresses and encouraging his roughly 760,000 YouTube followers to do the same. (Roblox refers to this as “hacking into” the platform.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HbngT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Police searched the conference for a fictitious ‘Islamic Extremist’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p1WIg9"&gt;The worst damage allegedly came during the Roblox Developers Conference in October of 2021. In the leadup to the conference, the suit says Simon “engaged his followers on Discord, glamorizing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17197100/youtube-headquarters-shooting-shooter-motive-hoaxes"&gt;April 3, 2018 active shooter and murder&lt;/a&gt; at YouTube headquarters in San Bruno, California, and threatening / taunting a copycat act of terrorism at Roblox headquarters,” telling followers to “wait until [someone] does it to Roblox.” Then, during the conference, he tweeted that local police were searching for a fictitious “notorious Islamic Extremist” and that the extremist had posted a video titled “Someone Blow Up Roblox Now!” Meanwhile, his followers allegedly posted false active shooting threats and claimed to have poisoned the conference’s drinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEoNLX"&gt;Roblox says the conference was temporarily locked down while police and private security searched the facility, and it incurred $50,000 in expenses securing the event and investigating the incident. It alleges that Simon committed fraud by falsely representing the existence of a terrorist threat and trying to scare users away from the event.&lt;/p&gt;
