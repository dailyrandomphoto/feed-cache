    <title>Amazon adds AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two Fire TV Edition TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GRIl6CVdBf_cSWN_jAr9Ezf2gMA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69584030/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zXQ8jp"&gt;Amazon is adding support for AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to two of its Fire TV Edition TVs in a free update, the company &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. Both the 2020 Toshiba 4K UHD Smart Fire TV with Dolby Vision and the 2020 Insignia 4K UHD Smart TV will receive the features, before they arrive on Amazon’s less expensive Fire TV sticks and set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7OgeT"&gt;On these specific TV sets, AirPlay 2 should function the same on Apple’s own Apple TV, allowing you to send audio and video from your phone, tablet, or computer to the big screen and control playback from your device. Integrating with HomeKit, Apple’s smart home ecosystem, requires a little extra legwork: you’ll have to enable HomeKit in your TV’s settings under Display &amp;amp; Sounds &amp;gt; AirPlay &amp;amp; HomeKit &amp;gt; Set Up, and then add it as a device in the Home app. Once it’s added, you can use Siri to turn your Fire TV on and off, change the volume, or switch inputs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSRKpf"&gt;Both AirPlay 2 and HomeKit coming to Fire TVs (and hopefully, one day soon, Fire TV sticks) should make using the TVs with Apple’s devices that much easier. Apple already has an in with Amazon’s devices — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20930244/apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick-models-now-available"&gt;Apple TV Plus app came to Fire TVs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX6Z41"&gt;It’s a stark contrast to how these two companies were interacting a little over five years ago, Back then, Amazon had banned sales of competing hardware like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/2/9439281/amazon-ban-apple-tv-chromecast-why"&gt;Apple TV (and Chromecast, and Nexus Player)&lt;/a&gt; in its marketplace because it claimed it was important to only sell media players that “interact well” with Prime Video. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/14/16777508/amazon-brings-back-apple-tv-google-chromecast"&gt;have since reconciled&lt;/a&gt;, and reached a very favorable deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;for Amazon that allows it to avoid Apple’s 30 percent App Store commission&lt;/a&gt; and use its own in-app purchase system. Now things are better. At least if you own an iPhone and Fire TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix snags former EA, Oculus exec to lead its video game efforts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kHyYKD-0XwbmYb2lJJOvB5rZm3U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583622/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gqqEE6"&gt;A report this spring from &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said that Netflix was seeking an executive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452173/netflix-gaming-subscription-service-executive-2022"&gt;to lead its push into gaming&lt;/a&gt;, with an eye toward offering an Apple Arcade or Xbox Game Pass-like subscription bundle. Now, as first reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-nflx-to-offer-video-games-on-its-streaming-platform?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming company has hired Mike Verdu as its vice president of game development reporting to COO Greg Peters. A Netflix spokesperson confirmed the hire to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxBAtP"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix could offer games right next to its other streaming content “within the next year” listed as a new genre just like documentaries or anything else, without charging extra for the experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvXwjj"&gt;Verdu is a former exec who has experience with mobile gaming companies like Zynga, ran EA Mobile for a year, and most recently has been working at Facebook acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22530144/facebook-oculus-studios-acquires-bigbox-vr-population-one"&gt;a series of Oculus game developers like BigBox VR&lt;/a&gt;, maker of &lt;em&gt;Population: One&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JJm1EO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The attention economy is dead, but Fortnite might hold the key to an answer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18246868/attention-economy-fortnite-advertising-user-engagement"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u3hhdu"&gt;On its last earnings call in April (&lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Netflix-Inc.-Q1-2021-Earnings-Call-Apr-20-2021.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), Peters said “...we’re in the business of creating these amazing deep universes and compelling characters and people come to love those universes and they want to immerse themselves more deeply and get to know the characters better and their back stories and all that stuff. And so really we’re trying to figure out what are all these different ways that we can increase those points of connection, we can deepen that fandom.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Asy3pk"&gt;“And certainly, games is (sic) a really interesting component of that... And there’s no doubt that games are going to be an important form of entertainment and an important sort of modality to deepen that fan experience. So we’re going to keep going, and we’ll continue to learn and figure it out as we go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBI14h"&gt;Netflix gaming forays have included interactive features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/2/18165182/black-mirror-bandersnatch-netflix-interactive-strategy-marketing"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Mirror: Bandersnatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21152973/netflix-carmen-sandiego-interactive-special-black-mirror-gaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carmen Sandiego&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as licensed games including a &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title for mobile devices. It also currently has a few job listings &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/93060254"&gt;for positions producing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/jobs/64788193"&gt;leading interactive products&lt;/a&gt;, postings that don’t mention the word gaming, but show it’s staffing up with people who have the experience necessary to help that division get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfKire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 7:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details and confirmation from a Netflix spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft attributes new SolarWinds attack to a Chinese hacker group</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3s1Ll1lDGUWV1c5_6N6SBoTcmI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583436/acastro_170621_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGaGmP"&gt;Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that SolarWinds software was attacked with a zero-day exploit by a group of hackers it calls “DEV-0322.” The hackers were focused on SolarWinds’ Serv-U FTP software, with the presumed goal of accessing the company’s clients in the US defense industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAaCsU"&gt;The zero-day attack was first spotted in a routine Microsoft 365 Defender scan. The software noticed an “anomalous malicious process” that Microsoft explains in more detail in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F07%2F13%2Fmicrosoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its blog&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems the hackers were attempting to make themselves Serv-U administrators, among other suspicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="klIEzb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Update Serv-U as soon as possible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U05ytu"&gt;SolarWinds reported the zero-day exploit &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35211"&gt;on Friday, July 9th&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that all of the Serv-U releases from May 5th and earlier contained the vulnerability. The company released a hotfix to address the issue and the exploit has since been patched, but Microsoft writes that if Serv-U’s Secure Shell (SSH) protocol connected to the internet, the hackers could “remotely run arbitrary code with privileges, allowing them to perform actions like install and run malicious payloads, or view and change data.” Anyone running older Serv-U software is encouraged to update it as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u5Adr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22173035/hackers-russia-breached-us-government-agencies-email-cozy-bear"&gt;The first hack&lt;/a&gt; that shoved SolarWinds into the limelight in December 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;exposed hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of government agencies and businesses. Unlike the previous hack, which is now widely connected to a Russian state-affiliated group of hackers called Cozy Bear, Microsoft says this zero-day attack originated in China. DEV-0322 has made a habit of attacking “entities in the US Defense Industrial Base Sector,” Microsoft writes, and is known for “using commercial VPN solutions and compromised consumer routers in their attacker infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says the base OnePlus 9 Pro actually won’t be sold in North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The whole camera system on the OnePlus 9 Pro is solid, but has room to improve" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abwW_Zeb-zdZl3IGCvW1HnAMCMU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583432/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0053_Edit_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Gg8nu"&gt;The OnePlus 9 Pro went on sale on April 2nd, but to date, the $969 base model, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, hasn’t been available to actually buy in North America. The company had told &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/03/oneplus-delays-sales-of-the-9-pros-969-base-model/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; on April 3rd&lt;/a&gt; that the base version was still on the way, but now, according to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/14/the-969-base-model-oneplus-9-pro-is-never-coming-to-the-us/"&gt;a new statement given to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it actually won’t make its way to the US or Canada due to “unforeseen supply constraints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V23oP9"&gt;Here’s the full statement, from &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6KWun5"&gt;“The OnePlus 9 Pro 8x128 GB variant was originally set to be sold in North America for $969. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen supply constraints specific to North American devices, we recently concluded it is no longer possible to bring this configuration to the United States and Canada. In North America we are prioritizing the 12x256 GB version to ensure our users have access to the highest spec device.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wKPcL9"&gt;This decision means that that the only OnePlus 9 Pro model available for US and Canadian consumers is the more expensive $1,069 version with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. But if you’re looking for a more affordable OnePlus phone, the OnePlus 9 is still a good option, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;my colleague Allison Johnson’s review&lt;/a&gt;. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the 9 Pro, it starts at $729, making it $340 cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM says two Chevy Bolts caught fire after getting recall fix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4rw7LhjEHsWBqPIFApN4fTUAHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583389/akrales_170405_1582_0571.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eYotk4"&gt;General Motors &lt;a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall"&gt;said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that two recent Bolt EV fires happened in vehicles that had already received the fix meant to prevent the battery pack from igniting, raising new questions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;about the recall announced last year&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, the automaker is warning owners of 2017-2019 model year Bolts not to charge the electric cars overnight, and to park them outside in case they catch fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV4g9P"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the same warning to owners late Wednesday, too. The safety agency said is still investigating the problem, that it’s looking into the two new fires, and said owners can enter their VIN number &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to check to see if their Bolt is included in the recall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHonMt"&gt;GM recalled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;nearly 69,000 Bolt EVs in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; after a handful of reports of fires that apparently started in the electric vehicles’ battery packs. The company warned owners at the time to park their Bolts outside until it could figure out the cause of the fires and settle on a fix, but it didn’t say anything at the time about not charging overnight. GM also issued an interim software update that limited the maximum capacity of the affected Bolts’ battery packs to 90 percent to reduce the chance of a fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ub6Yhx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dealers started implementing the fix in May&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qdRMOP"&gt;It wasn’t until May of this year, though, that GM &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;finally shared its plan to fix the problem causing the fires&lt;/a&gt;. It ultimately involved having Chevy dealers inspect the battery packs, swap out any suspect battery modules, and install new software meant to “detect potential issues related to changes in battery module performance before problems can develop.”  This software is also being installed on the revamped Chevy Bolt and the Bolt EUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxPDJO"&gt;The problem now is that this fix may not be working. Two recent fires happened in vehicles that had received the new software and been checked by a dealer — including &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/gm-warns-some-bolt-ev-owners-dont-park-them-inside-or-charge-them-unattended-overnight.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1626290713"&gt;one in a vehicle owned by a Vermont state lawmaker&lt;/a&gt;. The other fire happened this week in New Jersey, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/14/gm-warns-some-bolt-ev-owners-dont-park-them-inside-or-charge-them-unattended-overnight.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Main&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1626290713"&gt;the company told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. GM says it’s still investigating the fires, and is asking owners who haven’t gotten the fix to take their Bolts in to a dealer regardless. At least nine fires have been documented, and the company has started &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/40825/gm-is-buying-back-dozens-of-chevy-bolt-evs-that-pose-fire-risk-due-to-rare-manufacturing-defect"&gt;buying back some Bolts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nmbe0"&gt;GM has remained tight-lipped about what is causing the fires throughout this whole process, but these earlier-model Bolts use the same cells from LG Chem that power Hyundai’s Kona EV, which has also been recalled following multiple reports of fires and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396480/hyundai-discontinue-kona-ev-korea-battery-fire-recall"&gt;canceled outright in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8ajim"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 14th, 6:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added second paragraph with information from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5G30XJ"&gt;Plex, the popular build-your-own streaming service, has added 15 new channels to its ad-supported streaming offering for free TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snhS8O"&gt;All of the new channels available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.plex.tv%2Fwatch-free-tv%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F14%2F22577727%2Fplex-15-new-tv-channels" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Plex’s free Live TV&lt;/a&gt; feed arrive on the service today, and most will be available globally (though a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that some are available in Latin America or the US only). Plex &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/do-it-all-streaming-service-plex-is-launching-a-new-tv-1844474303"&gt;originally launched&lt;/a&gt; the free TV feature last year as a collection of pre-programmed, continuous channels rather than traditional over-the-air streams. So it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; live TV, but it does offer a similar linear experience if you’re just looking to throw something on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qls4f3"&gt;Of these new channels, some notable additions include MMA TV, USA Today, USA Today Sportswire, and the Tribeca Channel. The full list of channels added today are, with summaries from Plex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lLF9GQ"&gt;AfroLandTV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KKbLoQ"&gt;WildEarth (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9o2X6S"&gt;Johnny Carson TV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TCIbe5"&gt;The Carol Burnett Show (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Uom3p"&gt;MMA TV (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aCI9vu"&gt;USA TODAY (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fJjl7X"&gt;USA TODAY Sportswire (Global)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="se0AHJ"&gt;Motorvision TV (Spanish, available in the US, Latin America, and Spain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gMzM6n"&gt;MST3K (US and Canada)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0Ib5e4"&gt;Shout! Factory TV (US and Canada)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rSrhoi"&gt;Tribeca Channel (US and Canada)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mxNPr7"&gt;Love Nature en Español (US)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BiEum9"&gt;The Walking Dead Universe (US)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OcK7DT"&gt;BUZZR (US)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ipcz4C"&gt;Motorvision TV (Portuguese, available in Brazil)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="BwjyZd"&gt;Plex’s user-friendly Live TV offering currently supports 182 free channels, with 24 news-specific channels. IFC Films Picks, IGN, Reuters, Yahoo! Finance, Cheddar News, Newsy, and FuboTV Sports Network are among the more notable channels already offered. The service also supports filtering for HD-only channels. If on-demand is more your speed, the service also offers a bunch of free movies to stream as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O29khe"&gt;Plex is widely known as a customizable content server, which by nature makes it a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20697751/piracy-plex-netflix-hulu-streaming-wars"&gt;bit of a piracy haven&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s increasingly leaning into a legitimized aggregate streaming option and expanding on its streaming partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtH90v"&gt;“With [every] new addition, we’re focused on continuing to expand our catalogue to provide entertainment options that speak to everyone,” Shawn Eldridge, VP of strategic alliances and content, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, having helped pioneer the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of three unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products. In those instances, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know what a good Kindle deal looks like when you see one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 10th-gen Kindle with lockscreen ads&lt;/a&gt; for $90, which is the usual price. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $110. If you buy either Kindle model, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $120 ($15 off its usual price); it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now, you can grab one for $70 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price we’ve seen on the e-reader outside of Prime Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;The fourth-gen Kindle Paperwhite, released in 2018, starts at $130 and comes in four different configurations: an 8GB Wi-Fi model, a 32GB Wi-Fi model, and a configuration of each that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a 6-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get the Paperwhite over the base Kindle. The 2018 model also added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;No deals are currently available for the Paperwhite, but you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $130 or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition for $150&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;; if you want the ad-free model, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $180&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon has discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $170&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/ref=mako_bundletwister_mt1?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads). If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. Unlike previous models, however, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for as low as $280&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp multi-device beta allows four devices at once even without a phone</title>

  &lt;p id="RBk3IR"&gt;Until now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7867529/whatsapp-is-coming-to-the-web"&gt;using WhatsApp web on your desktop&lt;/a&gt; or any other device has required having a phone that’s powered on and connected, but a new beta test is trying out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21361542/whatsapp-multiple-devices-support-ipad-app-chat-sync-rumors"&gt;support for multiple devices&lt;/a&gt; without needing a phone in the mix. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466425/whatsapp-multi-device-support-disappearing-mode-view-once-features-confirmed"&gt;a June interview&lt;/a&gt;, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart and his boss, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, commented on the technical challenge of maintaining end-to-end encryption. With &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/07/14/security/whatsapp-multi-device/"&gt;a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, Cathcart explains more about what has been done behind the scenes to maintain security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQESK80QqqQ5XJGGBl3Qt-c1My4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22718057/whatsapp_e2e.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;WhatsApp’s message architecture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glO7XX"&gt;As the image comparing the legacy and new systems (above) tries to explain, previously, a user’s phone managed the key determining their identity and ability to encrypt/decrypt messages. The encrypted synchronization also applies to message history, contact names, and other data, with keys maintained on the individual devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHg4jd"&gt;To start, the beta is going out to a limited group of testers who are already in WhatsApp’s beta program, while the team says it’s working on improving performance and adding more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOuDBw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We've been working on this for a long time. Until now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; has only been available on one device at a time. And desktop and web support only worked by mirroring off your phone - which meant your phone had to be on and have an active internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1415386856783417344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Facebook is giving up on brain-typing as an AR glasses interface</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook’s prototype brain-computer interface headset." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8geffYUGj679PDkI92Dx2bDbmdI=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69583229/FRLR_head_mounted_BCI_research_prototype_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s prototype brain-computer interface headset.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kcsy32"&gt;A Facebook-backed initiative aiming to let people type by thinking has concluded with new findings published today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXOJ49"&gt;Project Steno was a multi-year collaboration between Facebook and the University of California San Francisco’s Chang Lab, aiming to create a system that translates brain activity into words. A new research paper, &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2027540?query=featured_home"&gt;published in &lt;em&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shows potential for implementing the technology for people with speech impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMNDAx"&gt;But alongside the research, Facebook made clear it is backing off the idea of a commercial head-mounted brain-reading device, and building out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;wrist-worn interfaces instead&lt;/a&gt;. The new research has no clear applicability for a mass-market tech product, and &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/bci-milestone-new-research-from-ucsf-with-support-from-facebook-shows-the-potential-of-brain-computer-interfaces-for-restoring-speech-communication/"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook said it is “refocusing” its priorities away from head-mounted brain-computer interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aHwKFY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has no interest in developing products that require implanted electrodes”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojB8qn"&gt;“To be clear, Facebook has no interest in developing products that require implanted electrodes,” Facebook said in a press release. Elsewhere in the release, it noted that “while we still believe in the long-term potential of head-mounted optical BCI technologies, we’ve decided to focus our immediate efforts on a different neural interface approach that has a nearer-term path to market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njdD9h"&gt;The Chang Lab’s ongoing research involves using implanted brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to restore people’s speech abilities. The new paper focuses on a participant who lost his ability to speak after a stroke over 16 years ago. The lab fitted the man with implanted electrodes that could detect brain activity. The man then spent 22 hours (spread over more than a year’s worth of sessions) training a system to recognize specific patterns. In that training, he would attempt to speak isolated words from a 50-word vocabulary set. In another training course, he tried to produce full sentences using those words, which included basic verbs and pronouns (like “am” and “I”) as well as specific helpful nouns (like “glasses” and “computer”) and commands (like “yes” and “no”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8UWufd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system decodes brain patterns for 50 words&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0b32ov"&gt;This training helped create a language model that could respond when the man was thinking about saying particular words, even if he couldn’t actually speak them. Researchers fine-tuned the model to predict which of the 50 words he was thinking about, integrating a probability system for English language patterns similar to a predictive smartphone keyboard. The researchers reported that in final trials, the system could decode a median rate of 15.2 words per minute, counting errors, or 12.5 words per minute with only correctly decoded words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgDnyZ"&gt;The Chang Lab published earlier Project Steno research in 2019 and 2020, showing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747483/facebook-ucsf-brain-computer-interface-typing-speech-recognition-experiment"&gt;electrode arrays and predictive models&lt;/a&gt; can create comparatively fast and sophisticated thought-typing systems. Many previous typing options involved mentally pushing a cursor around an on-screen keyboard using a brain implant, although some other researchers have experimented with methods &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2.epdf?sharing_token=eAprjV_8S6Qc8J1zLl0VSNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0No0Kktd9EUuDWeYWONAJ_7c9Vh-4dwWbu73lNBtR0SQIf6IATlhZ46V90CDPbxsCgHogM2xYRberQ4HCpdQUp7qXnyqphTgRRQhmIg-gmDZjKpzIMI0woUSLT2nD4r9orFcuEoen_nEeWyjCeY2FE-2NDKJ5jZhym5EMMtinU0e36ddzGXYFj1NmBYdCRoT5M%3D&amp;amp;tracking_referrer=spectrum.ieee.org"&gt;like visualizing handwriting&lt;/a&gt;. Where the lab’s earlier research involved decoding brain activity in people who were talking normally, this latest paper demonstrates that it works even when subjects don’t (and can’t) speak aloud.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5uSjnY"&gt;In a press release, UCSF neurosurgery chair Eddie Chang says the next step is to improve the system and test it with more people. “On the hardware side, we need to build systems that have higher data resolution to record more information from the brain, and more quickly. On the algorithm side, we need to have systems that can translate these very complex signals from the brain into spoken words, not text but actually oral, audible spoken words.” One major priority, Chang says, is greatly expanding the vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1zt7i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook will focus on wrist-mounted EMG bands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pj5LkW"&gt;Today’s research is valuable for people who aren’t served by keyboards and other existing interfaces, since even a limited vocabulary can help them communicate more easily. But it falls far short of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/19/15360798/facebook-brain-computer-interface-ai-ar-f8-2017"&gt;the ambitious goal Facebook set in 2017&lt;/a&gt;: a non-invasive BCI system that would let people type 100 words per minute, comparable to the upper speeds they could reach on a traditional keyboard. The latest UCSF research involves implanted tech and doesn’t come close to hitting that number — or even the speeds &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49933204"&gt;most people can reach&lt;/a&gt; on a phone keyboard. That bodes ill for the commercial prospects of a tech like an external headband that optically measures brain oxygen levels, which Facebook Reality Labs (the company’s virtual and augmented reality hardware wing) &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/imagining-a-new-interface-hands-free-communication-without-saying-a-word/"&gt;unveiled in prototype form&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7ZTq6"&gt;Since then, Facebook acquired electromyography (EMG) wristband company CTRL-Labs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, giving it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;an alternate control option&lt;/a&gt; for AR and VR. “We’re still in the early stages of unlocking the potential of wrist-based electromyography (EMG), but we believe it will be the core input for AR glasses, and applying what we’ve learned about BCI will help us get there faster,” says Facebook Reality Labs research director Sean Keller. Facebook won’t completely give up on the head-mounted brain interface system, but it’s planning to make the software open-source and share the hardware prototypes with outside researchers, while winding down its own research.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube borrows three more features from Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1QUPLH4pvuIGye3fP0oX9hOQE0=/108x0:768x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69582952/clips.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube now supports creating clips from live streams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ko6jAb"&gt;YouTube is adding a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/117186067/availability-updates-for-clips-polls-subscribers-only-chat"&gt;trio of new features&lt;/a&gt; for live-streaming today that are all standbys for streamers on Twitch. Streamers will now be able to limit their chats to subscribers only, they’ll be able to create polls inside of their chats, and they and their viewers will now be able to create clips from popular gaming streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPCZS"&gt;These features have been around for a while on Twitch, and they’re all important tools to let streamers engage with their community. Limiting chats to subscribers only can help as a moderation tool by weeding out people who are just popping by, and it gives streamers another tool to encourage their viewers to start paying. And polls are useful for engaging with the often-chaotic chatrooms, giving streamers a simple way to ask for input on what they should do next.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nvJdSDt-qpukdRXmsKv-t0Vl0ss=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717893/Comp_5.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polls are now supported in live chats on YouTube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EKC4Zt"&gt;Clips are also a critical tool for discovery. Since most people aren’t going to watch a multi-hour live stream, Twitch’s clipping tool allows fans to catch and share highlights, which can help bring new people to a streamer. YouTube is still limiting clips to gaming creators with more than 1,000 followers, though it says the feature will roll out to everyone eventually. Clips, like the chat features, had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254528/youtube-clips-alpha-twitch-mixer-facebook-livestreaming"&gt;been in testing&lt;/a&gt; with a limited number of creators until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWmHlO"&gt;While Twitch is still the dominant name in live-streaming, Facebook Gaming and YouTube Gaming have been growing. &lt;a href="https://blog.streamlabs.com/streamlabs-and-stream-hatchet-q4-live-streaming-industry-report-a898c98e73f1"&gt;According to Streamlabs and Stream Hatchet&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube had about a quarter of the market in terms of hours watched at the end of 2020, with Twitch representing about two-thirds of all viewership. YouTube has a long way to go to catch up, but adding in basic features like these can go a long way in supporting streamers and helping them grow.&lt;/p&gt;
