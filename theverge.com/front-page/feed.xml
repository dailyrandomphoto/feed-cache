    <title>Nintendo profits decline year-on-year as Switch hits 89 million sold</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kM5x0e"&gt;Nintendo has released its earnings for the April-June quarter, and while the figures would normally be strong for what’s usually a slow period, revenue and profit are both down compared to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356750/nintendo-earnings-q1-2020-switch-animal-crossing-sales"&gt;a year ago&lt;/a&gt;. That’s perhaps not surprising given the company was then riding a surge in demand for video games during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and had just released the mega-hit &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58WzGM"&gt;By comparison, Switch hardware sales were down 21.7 percent to 4.45 million units, and software sales decreased 10.2 percent to 45.29 million units. Nintendo has now sold 89.04 million Switch consoles in total; for comparison, the PS5 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;just hit 10 million&lt;/a&gt;. Revenue decreased 9.9 percent to 322.6 billion yen ($2.94 billion), while operating profit was 119.6 billion yen ($1.09 billion), a 17.3-percent decline year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s now sold nearly 34 million copies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l1MRj"&gt;Nintendo’s biggest release this current quarter is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which came out last month. The company can expect a boost in Switch hardware sales next quarter due to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22576029/legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;new OLED model&lt;/a&gt; in October, even though it isn’t bringing the widely expected upgrade in power. Nintendo’s slate of games for the all-important holiday quarter includes &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, and remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines will let you watch 30 minutes of TikTok in the air for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airfield At Miami International Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TlDp_ZUENTpTBOyZ58ZSzQeHdg=/14x0:2986x1981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680846/1323904371.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VGSpgm"&gt;Free TikTok has arrived on some of American Airlines’ flights, according to &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Passengers will be able to use the app for up to 30 minutes for free, which gives them time to watch at least ten of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;new, longer TikToks&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have the app already installed, the airline says you’ll be able to download it for free while in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0gHbI"&gt;The move to make TikTok available to travelers comes as airlines are trying to get attention back on flying, after the &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/data-spotlight/march-2021-airline-passenger-volume-shows-signs-aviation-recovery"&gt;number of people traveling&lt;/a&gt; by air &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409152/united-delta-airlines-change-fee-eliminate-covid"&gt;dropped during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. One of its competitors, United, has also been adding tech upgrades to its fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596430/united-airlines-preorder-food-drink-website-app"&gt;allowing passengers to pre-order in-flight snacks&lt;/a&gt; and adding planes that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556316/united-airline-bluetooth-in-flight-entertainment-new-jets"&gt;support bluetooth audio for the in-seat screens&lt;/a&gt;. American has &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ramseyqubein/2020/12/16/american-airlines-to-offer-free-inflight-messaging-and-new-priority-boarding-perks/"&gt;recently allowed passengers to use Facebook Messenger&lt;/a&gt; for free in-flight, giving them at least some connection to the outside world — something that some of its competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16375474/delta-free-in-flight-messaging-whatsapp-imessage-facebook-planes-gogo"&gt;have done for years&lt;/a&gt; for it and other messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3cFsL"&gt;According to the airline’s press release, the promotion is a “trial.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/tiktok-your-new-in-flight-entertainment-option/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that customer response will determine how long the trial will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peD9CB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline suggests TikToks about travel and finance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRJKNh"&gt;If you’re planning your flights around free TikTok, it’s probably worth keeping in mind that it doesn’t seem like every flight will have access to it. American Airlines specifies that the promotional offer is limited to narrow-body aircraft that have Viasat Wi-Fi systems. A lot of planes in &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/planes/planes.jsp"&gt;the airline’s fleet&lt;/a&gt; seem to count as narrow-body, but planes like the Boeing 787 &lt;a href="https://www.boeing.com/commercial/widebody/"&gt;don’t&lt;/a&gt;. American also uses &lt;a href="https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/experience/entertainment/wi-fi-and-connectivity.jsp"&gt;a few Wi-Fi providers for its flights&lt;/a&gt;, so even if a flight has Wi-Fi there’s a chance it won’t be from Viasat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUy2wE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.aa.com/news/news-details/2021/American-Airlines-Takes-TikTok-to-New-Heights-with-Free-Inflight-Access-for-Customers-MKG-OB-08/default.aspx"&gt;airline’s press release&lt;/a&gt; tells its passengers that they can expect to find a ton of content on the platform, including “travel inspiration” and “career advice.” While it’s hard to imagine many people sitting on a plane watching TikToks about how to make a resumé, spending a half hour looking up short videos about wherever you’re going isn’t actually the worst idea. Let’s just hope that your time isn’t eaten up by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22610175/amazon-tiktok-fake-ad-flo-rida-low-roblox-apple-bottom-jeans"&gt;bizarre fake ads with Flo Rida songs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Draw like it’s 1989 with this Kid Pix web app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4aEg4mzod4J2sK3tu2QmiVWMAaA=/45x0:1212x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680744/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.18.34_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rSr7iX"&gt;Kid Pix, an iconic piece of kid-friendly desktop art software, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000/status/1423014244644122627"&gt;has been ported to Javascript and HTML&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vikrum5000"&gt;Vikrum Nijjar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;The web version of Kid Pix&lt;/a&gt; is based one &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kid_Pix#Kid_Pix_5:_The_S.T.E.A.M._Edition"&gt;the original 1.0 version released for Macs in 1989&lt;/a&gt; by Craig Hickman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Kixm8"&gt;It has the expected tools like paint brushes, rubber stamps, shapes, and letters, all scored by Kid Pix’s highly memorable sound effects. The sounds and Kid Pix’s somewhat inscrutable interface are the real draw here. The program’s inherent playfulness encourages you to explore, even if you’re not a kid anymore. You can see a spokesperson from Kid Pix’s first publisher Broderbund &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TayProAkmBE"&gt;talk through some of the original app’s features&lt;/a&gt; below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rRjjlG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TayProAkmBE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6D1qw9"&gt;I didn’t remember using Kid Pix at first, but pulling up the web version of Kid Pix and stamping a random assortment of strawberries only to be greeted with the app’s distinct THWACK sound effect, immediately confirmed that yes, I am child of the 90s. You might be similarly stirred by the dull KABOOM paired with Kid Pix’s “Firecracker” tool. Or the bizarre WOOOW that accompanies the “Doorbell” tool. Kid Pix is refreshingly weird in a way that most software isn’t in our polished, user-friendly 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0fb5ZKdwh5ZJrMCCvleJZgwN1J0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762429/Screen_Shot_2021_08_04_at_5.09.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some casual Kid Pix art can be quite good, in my opinion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ob8CDg"&gt;It’s fun to take a trip down memory lane, and loading up a website in your browser is a lot easier than digging up a version of Kid Pix that will actually run on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YvEEg"&gt;You can try Kid Pix now, &lt;a href="https://kidpix.app/"&gt;right from your browser&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 may give the iPhone’s camera an upgrade: fewer green flares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1EEmaRhJrnLZ3NJ4cvReKzmsJg=/0x199:2388x1791/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680500/IMG_2220.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtVSH9"&gt;The latest version of Apple’s iOS 15 beta seems to be making subtle improvements to photos by processing out the green lens flares that can show up in outdoor pictures (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). News of the feature was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted to the iOSBeta subreddit&lt;/a&gt; by Reddit user Doubleluckstur, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to see it in action by testing with an iPhone 12 Mini running the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xNJPR"&gt;Many iPhone users will be familiar with the green blobs, and while taking a picture it seems like nothing’s changed — the flare still shows up in the viewfinder. But when you go to view the final picture, the flare is nowhere to be seen (in some cases; we’ll get to that in a bit). It does seem to be the result of all the post-processing that’s done to the picture, as the flare shows up in the alternate (and less-processed) frames that are available if you’re using Apple’s Live Photo feature.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxjdgr8cE301KrCX9jJufRFYiWo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762173/RPReplay_Final1628109977_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green dot shows up in the viewfinder and Live Photo, but not the processed still.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="AsRhIt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10686247"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYq911"&gt;So far it’s a bit unclear which iPhone models the processing happens on. In the Reddit thread, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7mecjl?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;one user reports&lt;/a&gt; also seeing the green dot removal on their iPhone XS, while &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7ohj3r?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;another says&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t work on their iPhone 8 Plus. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/04/ios-15-can-auto-remove-lens-flares-in-photos/#disqus_thread"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; that the feature could be limited to phones with an A12 Bionic processor or newer (so the XS and XR onward). The feature only being available on newer phones wouldn’t necessarily be surprising: some of iOS 15’s features, like Live Text or Portrait mode for FaceTime, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;already have the A12 Bionic listed as a requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCaB9M"&gt;Of course, with this discovery came people trying to chase it down and find its limitations. Reddit user -DementedAvenger- &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/oxc3a6/ios_15_beta_4_the_camera_app_now_autoremoves_lens/h7lopz8?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;posted examples of the flare still showing up&lt;/a&gt; on top of trees or mesh bug-proof window screens, as well as flares that came from a bathroom light instead of the sun. I was also able to replicate his tree example, as well as get some indoor flares of my own (though it’s worth noting that they’re not the same green bubble flares that so often occur from the sun).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hZxs_ku6WSu6_mljI9EFsGlbqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762112/IMG_2212.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can still get flares if you’re really trying, especially indoors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FgXtxl0S2tqx2T5xF7vvSu3o7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762119/IMG_2215.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the flare on the right side of the tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xOvsrd"&gt;Another limitation is video: I couldn’t find any scenarios where flares showed up any differently in the final video than they did in the viewfinder. Of course, removing a lens flare from 30 or 60 frames per second 4K footage would be quite a bit more computationally intensive, and have a greater chance of looking a bit weird, so it’s not necessarily surprising that the feature seems to be photo-only for now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GK_C-ZGCEC5do2EfQTAGN9UifT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762271/RPReplay_Final1628115178_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gif compression turns it white, but the flare is still clearly visible in this video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pNn8s7"&gt;As always with beta features, the functionality we’re seeing here could be different with the next release, or gone altogether. Still, it seems that Apple is at least experimenting with getting rid of the green blobs that can crop up in images from time to time, and it would be a welcome thing to see in the final version of iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5pmmN"&gt;Facebook is streamlining the settings page on mobile in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;a new redesign&lt;/a&gt; that’s rolling out starting Wednesday. Visually, the new layout looks much less cluttered, and individual settings don’t have descriptions, meaning you’ll see more on the page at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ROKf"&gt;Facebook has also changed up the organization of the settings themselves. The company has reduced the number of categories for settings and renamed them, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/facebook-settings-redesign/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, so now, you’ll see six categories of settings: Account, Preferences, Audience and Visibility, Permissions, Your Information, and Community Standards and Legal Policies. Some settings have also been relocated so that they’re by related ones, Facebook says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMPyON"&gt;You’ll be able to see the new look on Android, iOS, mobile web, and Facebook Lite. You might already have the redesign — I just checked the Facebook app on my iPhone 12 Mini and it loaded up. It was present on the mobile web for me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Job alert: ‘Spaceport Mixologist’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWdvmKssy8krvMlsL_TsZbrgxhE=/0x44:921x658/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69680227/Es7VmxuXEAASF3t.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Two since-destroyed Starship prototypes stand erect at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas Starship facilities. | Elon Musk&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TKrWkf"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX is seeking a “Spaceport Mixologist” who can whip up space-themed drinks next to the company’s sprawling rocket factory in south Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdZiaL"&gt;While space itself likely won’t be in their future, an experienced bartender — who will have one of the coolest job titles — will be tapped to join the hundreds of employees working on SpaceX’s massive Starship rocket system in rural Boca Chica, Texas. The mixologist will probably work out of the small house next to SpaceX’s budding spaceport that Musk calls the Starbase Tiki Bar and sling tiki drinks like the Test Pilot or Jet Pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoHyQA"&gt;“Experience pairing drinks with a themed menu” is on the list of preferred skills. “SpaceX has a number of food service outlets and formats serving our workforce and are looking to add many more. We are searching for candidates who have superior mixology experience with a focus in resorts, bars, and full service restaurants,” the &lt;a href="https://boards.greenhouse.io/spacex/jobs/5417887002?gh_jid=5417887002"&gt;job description&lt;/a&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A7FZX_9P9raomLH92Iochok7z6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22762142/Ek4Pea_X0AAJC6b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Elon Musk&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of a drink at SpaceX’s tiki bar, according to Musk.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYlqGE"&gt;Also at SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Erdayastronaut/status/1347973060943609856?s=20"&gt;restaurant&lt;/a&gt; and another bar in one of the company’s rocket-building towers that overlooks the whole spaceport. Musk calls that bar “High Bar” — in the “high bay” of the tower — and has described it as a “futuristic bar” with “360 degree windows &amp;amp; a glass floor looking down on the rocket factory.” SpaceX &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TylerG1998/status/1408984275354013697?s=20"&gt;hosted a party&lt;/a&gt; at the High Bar in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BgsWkd"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wHuoof"&gt;SpaceX is staffing dozens of food service jobs at locations in Texas and California to feed the company’s growing workforce. Cooks, baristas and sous chefs are among the open positions under the food services category of SpaceX’s jobs page. While SpaceX’s food establishments mainly serve its own employees, the public might not be left out for long. “I super support public spaces around our production &amp;amp; launch sites, wherever it can be done safely and securely,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347977322364694528?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in January. “When covid passes, we will open up our restaurant to the public &amp;amp; figure out ways to allow limited access to the High Bar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Gr4Aq"&gt;It’s not unusual for big tech and aerospace companies to employ chefs and baristas to serve their employees. From Facebook to Google to Boeing, they all have chefs and baristas, according to LinkedIn, and SpaceX has several chefs and baristas as well. But &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;hasn’t been able to find evidence of any in-house mixologists at other companies. One of Musk’s other companies, Neuralink, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421622513918955524?s=20"&gt;just built it’s own bar&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s unclear whether the brain interface startup employs its own mixologist yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLucCb"&gt;SpaceX’s Boca Chica site is in its infancy, but it could one day send humans to the Moon — the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;won a contract from NASA in April&lt;/a&gt; to launch the first US astronauts to the lunar surface since 1972. But before that moonshot happens, and probably before the tiki bar and restaurant open to the public, SpaceX has a ways to go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22352366/elon-musk-spacex-faa-warnings-starship-sn8-launch-violation-texas"&gt;‘maturing’ the more critical functions&lt;/a&gt; at Musk’s Starbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple places female engineering program manager on administrative leave after tweeting about sexism in the office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfOdMl213orTGUFd0OKn-9z4C_Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679863/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONzepy"&gt;Apple has placed senior engineering program manager Ashley Gjøvik on indefinite administrative leave after she tweeted about sexism in the office. The company is currently investigating claims Gjøvik made about a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcaR7F"&gt;“For months, I have been raising concerns with Apple employee relations about years of experiences with sexism, a hostile work environment, sexual harassment, unsafe working conditions, and retaliation,” Gjøvik says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I asked them to mitigate the hostile work environment while they investigate, and they initially offered me EAP therapy and medical leave. I told them that made no sense, and said they should talk to my leadership and set up oversight and boundaries. I added that if there was no other option they could give me paid administrative leave. They apparently made no effort to set boundaries and instead said they were placing me on administrative leave and implied they did not want me on Slack where I had been vocal about my concerns with certain policies at the company. They also implied they didn’t want me to meet one-on-one with other women at the company about their concerns with Apple policies, which I had been doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYW22k"&gt;This afternoon, Gjøvik set an out of office message informing colleagues that the employee relations team had placed her on indefinite paid leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dpRzyx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, following raising concerns to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/hostileworkenvironment?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#hostileworkenvironment&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/unsafeworkconditions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#unsafeworkconditions&lt;/a&gt;, I'm now on indefinite paid administrative leave per &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations, while they investigate my concerns. This seems to include me not using Apple's internal Slack.&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1423014977661591552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTXTo"&gt;This is the second time Apple has investigated Gjøvik’s claims about sex discrimination at the company. The employee relations team closed an earlier investigation, allegedly finding that nothing was wrong, prompting Gjøvik to tweet screenshots with what she says is just a small portion of what she experienced:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4YgO7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wanted to share: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations confirmed this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tonepolicing?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#tonepolicing&lt;/a&gt; is totally ok feedback for me to get from my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigtech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bigtech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/male?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#male&lt;/a&gt; leaders &amp;amp; not &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexist?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexist&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As this investigation rolls on, I've decided to start Tweeting the stuff they say is "ok." I mean, they did say it was ok? &lt;a href="https://t.co/EImLTjRTBl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EImLTjRTBl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422380335703101443?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z3eNab"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In today's &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; employee relations said its fine update, here's the heartfelt email I sent my &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigtech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bigtech&lt;/a&gt; male leadership in 2018 during the Kavanaugh hearings. I asked for support of women &amp;amp; to condemn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexualassault?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexualassault&lt;/a&gt;. The reply: a text saying "FWIW, RBG thinks he's ok." &lt;a href="https://t.co/0GTthZNEgH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0GTthZNEgH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M. Gjøvik (@ashleygjovik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1422953562724737024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="f11v2A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This happened to me at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; too: they offered EAP and suggested medical leave after I spoke up about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sexism?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#sexism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/discrimination?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#discrimination&lt;/a&gt;, and a hostile work environment. They also suggested requesting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ADA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/disability?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#disability&lt;/a&gt; accommodations after I raised concerns about unsafe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/workconditions?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#workconditions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LW0Ueq1Leb"&gt;https://t.co/LW0Ueq1Leb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley M.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVcnq6"&gt;Apple is currently contending with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;a wave of employee activism&lt;/a&gt;, including multiple women tweeting about their dissatisfaction with the company culture. In May, employees wrote a letter demanding an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez&lt;/a&gt;, who’d written a book about Silicon Valley with descriptions of women many people found offensive.  Hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvqKiC"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Playdate’s first season of games won’t hit every handheld at the same time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2B-kXc-6jJ_pGhWGuNVo3EU3fo=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679840/Playdate_model_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ktTm2"&gt;One of the most intriguing aspects of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;Panic’s Playdate&lt;/a&gt; — besides its lovely crank — is the unique game delivery method that will bring 24 free games to the device. Panic plans to release a season of games (Season One), two games at a time each week. &lt;a href="https://help.play.date/games/season/"&gt;In a new FAQ released on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Panic explains a bit more about how that’ll work and reveals that, due to limited manufacturing capacity, not everyone will be playing new games at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYcxYQ"&gt;All Playdates will download new games weekly on “New Game Day” as long they’re connected to Wi-Fi, starting with the first two games when you connect your device. The catch is that not everyone will connect their Playdate to the internet on day one due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;limited preorders&lt;/a&gt;. That means rather than being in sync with the entire Playdate population (what Panic’s original “season of games” pitch implied), players will instead receive games in more or less the same cadence as the people in their preorder batch. Panic explains that this slight adjustment is due to what level of manufacturing and distribution is possible during the pandemic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xlGUGp"&gt;Our initial dream was a fully synchronized season for every owner, but that turned out to be really really hard to do with the reality of manufacturing (the factory can only make so many a week!) and distribution (international package delivery is only so reliable!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OZFI1h"&gt;If Panic does decide to do a Season Two of games,  it says it should be able to pull off its original plan since many people will already own Playdates. The company also makes it clear that even though the Playdate will automatically download games, you don’t have to be committed to them. You can delete and re-download games at any time if you need to make room on your device for other homemade titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfUTqk"&gt;You can see our impression of the Playdate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587172/playdate-hands-on-preview"&gt;in our hands-on here&lt;/a&gt; and a preview of what games Panic has lined up for Season One &lt;a href="https://play.date/"&gt;on its Playdate site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Flo Rida Roblox Amazon TikTok ad is fake but amazing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q3Hl7JynqSdBbPkOcltMEnt-0s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69679707/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f35lYL"&gt;On Wednesday, a surreal TikTok ad from an advertiser posing as Amazon confused users into thinking the e-commerce giant was taking a stab at including absurdist internet humor into its online marketing strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9EsHu"&gt;The ad featured gaming footage from the lego-like title &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;interspersed with strange clips of a man dancing to Flo Rida and T-Pain’s 2008 hit “Low,” but only the part where T-Pain says “Apple Bottom jeans.” There are also robot voices bullying each other about grandmas and girlfriends overlaid on the ad. The bizarre video was highlighted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?s=20"&gt;Eddy Burback&lt;/a&gt;, a popular YouTuber and streamer, on his Twitter feed Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCsgIo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this was an amazon ad I got on tik tok???&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;this is 100% real I just recorded it &lt;a href="https://t.co/cST0JoKb33"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cST0JoKb33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eddy Burback (@eddyburback) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eddyburback/status/1422972566629543941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUcmI8"&gt;The ad purported to be purchased by the e-commerce giant Amazon, but Amazon told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Wednesday that the ad was fake. Amazon said that it was investigating the issue with TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn7mBU"&gt;Later Wednesday, a TikTok spokesperson said that the ad wasn’t fraudulent, but the result of a technical issue. “This situation was the result of a technical issue, which temporarily swapped the Amazon ad creative with a different video,” a TikTok spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The issue has now been fixed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8bUw7"&gt;When you click the link attached to the ad, it brings you to an Amazon search results page for the key word “revealhome1.” The results include home decor and kitchen items like curtain ties and food jars. The ad could be an attempt to promote an Amazon referral code, and purchases made through the link would give the advertiser a cut of Amazon’s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJ4rSw"&gt;Last year, TikTok opened up its self-serve advertising platform to all advertisers, taking on other digital ad market competitors like Facebook and Google, &lt;a href="https://digiday.com/media/tiktoks-self-service-platform-launch-is-perfectly-timed-to-kick-facebook-while-its-down/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Digiday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While these self-service ad management services can create loads of revenue for companies like TikTok and Facebook, they’ve also been subject to fraud and &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/social-media/facebook-approved-ads-with-coronavirus-misinformation/"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFl1WU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 8/4/21 at 8:27PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYT crossword puzzle no longer works in third-party apps, crosses puzzle solvers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lA0MmX"&gt;People will no longer be able to play the digital version of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; daily crossword puzzle in third-party apps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/crosswords/nyt-games-no-longer-available-on-across-lite-as-of-aug-9.html"&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. Starting August 10th, the crossword will be available digitally only via the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; site or on its own crossword app. Downloadable PDFs, in addition to the physical newspaper, will still be available for people who want to print and play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpWDze"&gt;Until now, crosswords were available in the &lt;a href="http://www.word-buff.com/across-lite.html"&gt;Across Lite .puz file format&lt;/a&gt;, so anyone with a &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; games subscription could download a puzzle and open it in the desktop or mobile app of their choice. The change applies not just to future puzzles but to the archive of puzzles that are currently in the .puz format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTOYDK"&gt;Everdeen Mason, editorial director of games at the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EverdeenMason/status/1422548999018516482"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that she made the decision to end .puz support in an effort to build something where editors can “edit and make games rather than adapt things for tools we can’t control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="53XWKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We also need to adapt to future technologies and build a foundation we can make more things on&lt;/p&gt;— EverQueen Mason (@EverdeenMason) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EverdeenMason/status/1422549001673584640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNrGi6"&gt;Some crossword solvers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danfeyer/status/1422348847020351498"&gt;are peeved&lt;/a&gt; about the change. &lt;a href="https://www.xwordblog.com/2021/08/02/no-more-across-lite/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XWord Blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a site for crossword enthusiasts, speed solvers and people who parse .puz files for puzzle analysis will likely be hit the hardest. Some people with low vision have mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ official crossword app doesn’t work well with screen readers, which will hopefully be addressed as third-party options disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
