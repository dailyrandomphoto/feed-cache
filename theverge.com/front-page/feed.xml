    <title>The massive 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is $400 off on Amazon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOKhMV"&gt;The Samsung Odyssey G9 gaming monitor is on sale right now for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-49-inch-Odyssey-FreeSync-LC49G95TSSNXZA/dp/B088HH6LW5?ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21355002%5Bt%5Da&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, down $400 from its original $1399 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXoXg2"&gt;The 49-inch 5120 x 1440 monitor comes with a fast 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and supports both G-Sync and FreeSync 2. As noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;our review of the Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt;, the curved monitor offers an immersive gaming experience, stretching around your entire field of vision as you game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKeEYm"&gt;It produces incredibly vivid colors thanks to its QLED display and emits 1,000 nits of brightness. My colleague, Sean Hollister, pretty much sums up what it’s like to game on this behemoth of a screen in his review:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aa9xVh"&gt;I’m not kidding when I say I have to avert my eyes when I launch &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; in HDR, and I could swear I felt the flames the first few times my &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;’ TIE Bomber blasted an X-Wing into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BppKYR"&gt;Samsung debuted an upgraded version of this display in July, called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22587089/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-49-inch-curved-gaming-monitor-price-specs-release-date-features"&gt;Odyssey Neo G9 monitor&lt;/a&gt;. Like the standard Odyssey G9, it’s also a 49-inch curved monitor with mostly the same specs. The main difference is that Odyssey G9 Neo has a mini-LED backlit panel that produces 2,000 nits of brightness, allowing for more contrast. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is currently trying out this monitor, and we’re finding that it may not be worth its hefty $2,499 price tag due to various issues we’re seeing — but we’ll go over that in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICZ0fY"&gt;As for the much cheaper $999 Odyssey G9, there aren’t any details on how long the deal will last on Amazon. However, we can speculate that it’s an early Black Friday promotion, so it may not be around too much longer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy Bebop’s English voice cast has strong feelings about the movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cowboy Bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lg5GUVuTyknrFGTIA1I9jdOxl20=/0x11:1146x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170984/bebop.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is just as important to the Netflix show as the animated series, but it isn’t receiving the same kind of consideration&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="HHp3Lp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: The Movie&lt;/em&gt;, known in Japan by the much better name &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop: Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;, was released in 2001 and takes place during the show’s final handful of episodes. Most anime movies don’t impact the overall arc of the show, featuring enemies, allies, and plot points that are rarely ever acknowledged outside the movie’s quarantine zone. However, &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; transcends the trope of the inconsequential anime movie and is critical to the conversation surrounding the show’s cultural impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAKyPm"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;, the gang are unwittingly sucked into a bio-terrorism plot, forced to stop the evil Vincent Volaju before he unleashes a deadly storm of nanobots on Mars. The movie hits on all the little things that make a typical &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; episode great. Every character gets a moment to let their unique talents save the day. There’s an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4haw18bnN1g"&gt;absolutely bitchin’ spaceship battle&lt;/a&gt; underscored by Yoko Kanno’s soul-stealing soundtrack. And at the end, the bad guy is tragically relatable. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9T_lxaxcW3EYmpH0EPY8n4cTVR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028495/CBP_e014_0076.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kESb7t"&gt;It’s the villain’s tragedy that makes &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; so crucial to &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;’s narrative. Every episode of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; gives you the tiniest glimpse into what makes each character tick, and in the movie, that glimpse widens into a window through which we are allowed to see the characters as never before. For the English voice cast of the show, the movie contains some of their most memorable moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OT4We8"&gt;“I actually got emotional regarding Spike’s experience,” Beau Billingslea, voice actor for Jet Black, says of the movie in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz35It"&gt;Steve Blum, voice of Spike Spiegel, agrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdN9nG"&gt;“I think the most profound moment for me was in the movie when he was talking to Electra about the pain that he was experiencing and his loss and damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szsnNa"&gt;Blum’s referring to one of the movie’s quieter moments in which he’s stuck in a prison with Elektra Ovirowa — voiced by &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Commander Shepard, Jennifer Hale. As Elektra shares her past romantic connection with Vincent, Spike shares a bit of his own history in the murderous Syndicate mob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvKWFD"&gt;“When I was younger, I wasn’t afraid of anything,” Spike says to Elektra in the movie. “I didn’t have the slightest fear of dying. [...] But then I met a certain woman and it changed. For the first time the idea of death began to scare me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bNNE6e"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XTXIWE7dIE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxYBZo"&gt;“It was the first time that he really got vulnerable,” Blum says, crediting that moment as the deepest and most open Spike ever is. This movie moment exposes in Spike a “vulnerability that he tried so hard to hide, or escape,” according to Blum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQP3db"&gt;Wendee Lee, the voice of Faye Valentine, also holds the movie in high regard. “We know all of these characters have damage,” Lee says. “We explore that systematically throughout the series. [...] But they save Spike for the film. Much later. Think of the genius that’s in the beats of storytelling in the way &lt;em&gt;Bebop &lt;/em&gt;delivers the story. I think that in itself is one of the greater appeals of the whole franchise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuKheL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; the series was recorded separately and disjointedly, with the actors coming in solo to record their scenes, one by one. Though the camaraderie we hear in the banter of the crew was recorded in isolation, it was no less genuine — and genuine in the actors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzW3VQ"&gt;“Steve left me a note in the script,” Billingslea recalls. “He said, ‘Hey Beau, Jet sucks.’ So I went forward in the script, and I said, ‘Hey Steve, Spike sucks, and the Bebop to my ship.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="20SKms"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the most profound moment for me was in the movie when he was talking to Elektra about the pain that he was experiencing and his loss and damage.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rfbikl"&gt;For the movie, the actors were brought into a big recording studio with the movie’s producers close at hand to offer opinions on actors’ performances. Despite that distraction, Blum says that recording the moment between Elektra and Spike was so emotional he “broke down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mcZe1H"&gt;“And the moment was fairly brief compared to the exposition for a lot of the other characters,” Blum continues. “And yet [it was] so incredibly powerful, and then goes right back into the action shortly after, it was kind of amazing. It really taught me that a moment can change your life for the better for the worse. It changed me as an actor, changed me as a person. And I didn’t have that realization until many years later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oo6Je"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;importance to &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; isn’t only because of profound character and actor moments, it’s also home to two of the best songs in the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; soundtrack canon and the actors agree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RhaSe"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0V-WGwJJj58"&gt;Gotta Knock A Little Harder&lt;/a&gt;” is one of Blum’s favorite songs (and mine, not gonna lie) as is “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YA4P1A3jtu0"&gt;What Planet Is This&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgzWGs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is having a renaissance. Twenty-two years after the show’s release, Netflix is launching a live-action adaptation along with making the original anime available on its streaming platform (the anime is also available to stream on Funimation). But amid the surge of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop &lt;/em&gt;news — the live-action show’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783815/netflix-cowboy-bebop-soundtrack"&gt;soundtrack will launch on Spotify&lt;/a&gt; the same day as the show — the movie seems to be missing from the conversation. It does not help that it can’t be streamed anywhere. It’s not available on either Netflix or Crunchyroll even though both services carry the show. (Curiously, though, you can stream it on Netflix in Canada — lucky Canadians.) The only reason I was able to rewatch the movie myself was because I still had a physical copy that I made my father buy from a Blockbuster the day it was released. &lt;em&gt;Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door&lt;/em&gt; is just as embedded into the DNA of the live-action show as the anime itself, and when we talk about how great &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; is, it should be included.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked images of the Google Pixel 6A show a more compact device with no headphone jack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzaoKf8ZjQ2Dn-2IPdMFSsMfxqw=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170839/google_pixel_6a_leak.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The leaked image of the mid-range Google Pixel 6A looks nearly identical to the Pixel 6. | Image: Steve Hemmerstoffer / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1u1f0G"&gt;Rendered images of the Google Pixel 6A have been leaked by reliable leaker Steve Hemmerstoffer (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks"&gt;@OnLeaks&lt;/a&gt;), and give us a glimpse at what the midrange device may look like, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mju2C6L3H1aLwoTeM61nmOhw1BU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23030217/back_google_pixel_6a_leak.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The leaked images show the Google Pixel 6A without a headphone jack. | Image: Steve Hemmerstoffer / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/google-pixel-6a-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jEfjF4"&gt;The rendered Pixel 6A, which belongs to the budget-friendly Pixel A-series lineup, looks almost identical to the standard Pixel 6. It seems to sport the same black camera strip on its rear that houses two cameras and a flash, along with a hole-punch selfie camera on the front. The bottom of the device appears to have a USB-C port, as well as a speaker and a microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDsXY5"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/20/google-pixel-6a-size-renders/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there appears to be no fingerprint sensor on the outside of the device — this might mean the scanner is placed beneath the screen just like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which Google recently issued an update for in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787537/google-pixel-6-pro-update-fingerprint-scanner-slow"&gt;attempt to improve the scanner’s performance&lt;/a&gt; issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MKvPAo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6A could be the first midrange Pixel device to come without a headphone jack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yT8Yn1"&gt;A headphone jack also appears to be absent from the Pixel 6A. If the rendered images are accurate, the Pixel 6A could be the first midrange Pixel device to come without one — previously, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530449/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-photos-video-specs-price-release-date-features-io-2019"&gt;Pixel 3A&lt;/a&gt; all had headphone jacks, as opposed to their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usCP6b"&gt;The Pixel 6A may also be a lot more compact than the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, measuring at just 152.2 x 71.8. x 8.7mm with a 6.2-inch display (via &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;). This is quite a bit smaller when compared to the size of a vanilla Pixel 6, which is 158.6 x 74.8 x 8.9mm with a 6.4-inch display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO4XZE"&gt;There’s no word on when the Pixel 6A will be released — after all, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro only came out last month — so we’ll probably have to wait a while to see some official images of the device.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astra reaches orbit for the first time with LV0007 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyI7Rhu4kSOnFKRvydPSmghOVDc=/144x0:2403x1506/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170468/astra_reaches_orbit.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Astra’s rocket prepares for takeoff from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97qhttuqtB4" target="_blank"&gt;NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z702wQ"&gt;Astra is now on the list of privately-owned space companies that have successfully reached orbit. Its Launch Vehicle 0007 (LV0007), which was carrying a test payload for the US military, took off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak Island, Alaska on Saturday at 1:16AM ET. Following a smooth liftoff, the 43-foot rocket achieved orbit around nine minutes later at 500km above Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qSfZf5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Astra just reached orbit! 7.61km/sec at our targeted 86.0 degree inclination at an altitude of 500km. The team worked hard for this. We’re just getting started, folks. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AdAstra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AdAstra&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/NiMhCEsuCI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NiMhCEsuCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Kemp (@Kemp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Kemp/status/1461960864391598088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jiPW2t"&gt;“The team’s worked so hard on this for so many years,” said Astra CEO Chris Kemp during a livestream after the launch. “We have rocket serial number eight, nine, 10 in production, so we’re just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tyURA2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The startup’s successful launch follows several failed attempts at reaching orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NUkI2"&gt;The California-based startup’s successful launch follows several failed attempts at reaching orbit. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21161727/darpa-launch-challenge-astra-space-competition-no-winner-prize"&gt;first attempted launch&lt;/a&gt; took place during the DARPA competition in March 2020, which tests rocket companies’ abilities to respond to requests from the US military. Astra wasn’t able to get its rocket off the ground due to technical issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taiA8c"&gt;Later that year in September, Astra attempted to reach orbit once again, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/12/21433698/astra-rocket-launch-end-failure-orbit"&gt;issues with the rocket’s guidance system&lt;/a&gt; led Astra to cut the flight short. Just three months later, Astra &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178110/astra-small-satellite-launcher-rocket-3-2-alaska-success-orbit"&gt;reached space for the first time&lt;/a&gt; with its Rocket 3.2 launch, however, it wasn’t able to successfully slip into orbit after running low on fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJiaq0"&gt;Astra’s most recent attempt was in August of this year. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722331/astra-rocket-launch-failure-identified-lv0007"&gt;engine failure caused&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;LV0006 to slide across&lt;/a&gt; the launchpad during takeoff, and the rocket only reached an altitude of 31 miles before Astra terminated the launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks4QDk"&gt;Now, Astra joins Virgin Orbit, SpaceX, and Rocket Lab as one of the few US companies that have achieved orbit with a privately-owned rocket. You can watch Astra’s entire launch from the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/97qhttuqtB4"&gt;NASASpaceflight YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwBbiu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 20, 4:25PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story incorrectly referenced Virgin Galactic instead of Virgin Orbit. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foundation’s first season loses itself in its century-spanning story</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Apple’s ambitious epic takes a while to get going&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="5ikwZZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season has officially wrapped with its season finale, which saw the first chapter of Apple TV Plus’ most ambitious show come to a conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvLslI"&gt;The epic sci-fi show, based on Isaac Asimov’s centuries-spanning series of novels, has grown far beyond its quasi-magic space math &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;from the initial episodes&lt;/a&gt;, spinning out different storylines ranging from drama in the Foundation’s newfound home of Terminus to the byzantine imperial politics of Trantor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz2Vqu"&gt;In the wake of the finale, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s Chaim Gartenberg and Andrew Webster are revisiting the show to see what worked, what didn’t, and what they’re hoping to see in the already-announced second season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnbBE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the entire first season of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Foundation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8IqBfgNL4xbz_pyw-C_hJVkafWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028213/Foundation_Photo_010904.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj4K4l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m really of two minds about &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. With the first season in the bag, I’m actually really enjoying the show as interesting, high-concept sci-fi. But the story that’s being told here is emphatically &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; that of &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;from the Asimov books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6O35S"&gt;I get that there’s bound to be differences in adapting a seven-book series (not counting the expanded &lt;em&gt;Empire &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Robot&lt;/em&gt; stories that Asimov later tied into a mostly cohesive whole) that was retroactively forged into books out of numerous short stories aiming to tell a story spanning 1,000 years of human history. But even with that said, after borrowing the basic premise — the Empire is going to fall and mankind will suffer 30,000 years of darkness unless something is done to cushion the dark age to 1,000 years, because “fancy math” — &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; just seems wholly uninterested in exploring that concept past the first episode or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oshlRK"&gt;The individual stories here are generally interesting on their own. The “genetic dynasty” of a succession of Lee Paces ruling the crumbling empire with an iron fist is the show’s highlight, thanks in no small part to Pace’s dynamic performances as the cloned Brother Day. And Salvor Hardin’s cat-and-mouse game on Terminus with the Anacreons is enjoyable sci-fi fare, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpLTS"&gt;Meanwhile, the third leg of the story, the prolonged drama of Gaal’s shuttling in cryo from place to place as the show hints at her mysterious powers, is… less compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZ3O5"&gt;The practical concerns of running a multi-season TV series also clearly impact the show. Some characters, like the Cleon clones or the seemingly immortal robot Demerzel, play well into the themes of the series and help give weight to the sheer size and scale of the Empire. But by the end of the finale, it felt like the show was twisting itself in knots to keep key characters like Hardin and Gaal around through multiple eras of the show so that the actors playing them could offer some continuity for the next season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMXhWqWlb9w0hdwpkT2LE_X2gdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028228/Foundation_Photo_010605.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8WQURB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not as well-versed on the source material, but I generally agree. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;Once all of the initial worldbuilding and discussion of future-predicting math was out of the way in the first few episodes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really picked up in a lot of ways. The worldbuilding remains incredible throughout. All of the many cultures and planets have a depth to them that is quite frankly astounding. That goes for the big things — like a desert planet’s incredibly detailed religious beliefs and ceremonies or the sheer scale of the landscapes you see — to the smaller moments, like the scratches on an old spacesuit or the way each culture has its own particular style of dress and armor. You can tell there was a huge budget here, and it was put to good use. (Even the special effects that seem out of place, like a certain robot skull in the finale, look amazing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyIGrI"&gt;Early on, I really struggled to identify with any of the cast. It was all setup and vanishingly little character development. As the story developed, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s confusing structure continued to make this a struggle. It jumps around &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of the stories it’s focused on and the timeline. There’s just so much going on, and so much complexity — Harri Seldon’s plan seemed complicated at first, but the many layers (and lies) it ends up involving made it even harder to follow — that’s only compounded by the fact that many of the characters live years beyond their life span through cryo-sleep or other means. Oh, and then there are the multiple generations of the emperor, all played by the same three actors, making things even harder to follow. It also doesn’t help that the show is far too serious all the time. I get that the fate of the universe is important, but &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; could definitely use a sense of humor to lighten the mood at times and let me connect to its cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6bWJG"&gt;It wasn’t until episode eight, where Lee Pace’s emperor faces a life-threatening trek through a desert, where I felt like I was finally getting to know these characters. Up until then, the show seemed more focused on the universe as a whole than it did the individual people whose stories it’s telling. Once it slowed down, though, and allowed viewers longer and quieter moments with the cast, it really worked. And like you said, even when they don’t have much to work with, much of the cast here does great with what’s in front of them — especially the villains. Pace exudes a cold calculating menace that borders on sociopathic, while Kubbra Sait, as the grand huntress of the planet of Anacreon, is terrifyingly focused on vengeance above all else. Another highlight is T’Nia Miller as a devout religious leader who stands tall against the empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2qcwQJzcoYaAYwl4ZEjkLBCBFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028233/Foundation_Photo_010802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HKnWC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ll join you in praising the worldbuilding: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; always looks incredible, from claustrophobic hallways on a derelict ship to the sweeping salt deserts to the stark stone of Terminus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w31CFZ"&gt;And the slower pace and steadily built-out cast do help flesh out the latter characters a lot more than Gaal, Hari, or Raych get throughout the first two episodes. Salvor’s extended screentime means that we get to know her, the often contentious relationship she has with her parents and the Foundation’s leadership, and her romantic fling with the Han Solo-esque Hugu (Daniel MacPherson, who helps add a much-needed lightness of tone whenever he shows up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPUSIo"&gt;The show also uses the time to raise some thoughts about the idea of religion and faith versus science and human effort, and the blurred lines between them, particularly as Seldin’s elaborate plan is revealed to help establish himself as a mythological figure in the history of the Foundation. It’s these sorts of parallels that &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t quite fully dig into, although hopefully the show will continue to explore those areas in season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jGujg"&gt;But&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s pace and added filler also has me raising some eyebrows at the show’s future. One of the draws of the original series is how it skips through time, showing snapshots of the fall of the Empire, the rise of the Foundation as a new power, how Seldon’s predictive powers do (and occasionally don’t) manage to foresee the different shifts and changes in the galactic sphere. And on that scale, &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; still feels like it’s stuck in the earliest stages of what it could be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="foundation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/et-VS8rNQSXH6RtXgr7eC5TvzOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23028249/Foundation_Photo_011004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0BrNx"&gt;In theory, that could all be part of the plan: showrunner David S. Goyer apparently pitched Apple on eight seasons of the series for a total of 80 episodes, which would justify the occasionally dragged-out pace if (and it’s a big &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; actually gets the time and budget to tell the other 87.5 percent of its story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWbRH1"&gt;And if &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; is going to try to forge forward in telling the story of Seldon’s 1,000-year plan, at some point it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; going to have to leave some of its cast and characters behind to forge ahead in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hJIyFs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, and here’s the thing: &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; really does feel like it’s building toward something interesting. But in these 10 episodes, it hasn’t reached that destination yet. It’s more like an extended prologue than its own story. Much like Hari Seldon’s followers, the show demands a lot of faith from viewers. In season 1, you’re investing 10 hours for the promise of a more interesting story to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The entire Ubisoft library of games is on sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gxbGmOiidEQgNvyDShFNvNFJDuI=/169x0:898x486/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70170249/Affiliates_black_friday_2021_533x300.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Great deals across Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uGQyft"&gt;In case you weren’t aware, the biggest shopping holiday of the year is right around the corner. Yes, Black Friday is nearly upon us, kicking off promptly following Thanksgiving in the US, which happens on Thursday, November 25th. And while some of the best deals are yet to come (don’t worry, we’ll have you covered), we’ve collected some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; you can cash in on right now from various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;brands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22547475"&gt;retailers&lt;/a&gt;. But for now, here’s what is especially alluring in the deals world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tvWqT"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fblack-friday%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDealsNewsletter111921%20"&gt;Black Friday sale at the Ubisoft store is live&lt;/a&gt;, and there are massive savings to be had on its catalog of games. Even brand new releases like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Riders Republic&lt;/em&gt; are enjoying solid discounts during this sale that runs until the 28th of November. At Ubisoft’s online store, make sure to use the code &lt;strong&gt;BF20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to slice an extra 20 percent off your purchase. Some other standout titles include &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; for $30, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; for $20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cu9bd"&gt;However, if you’re not in the mood to fork over cash for free Ubisoft swag, you can still &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Ftom-clancys-splinter-cell-chaos-theory-%2F56c4948a88a7e300458b482a.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F20%2F22791348%2Fubisoft-apple-airpods-razer-keyboard-webcam-google-stadia-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory&lt;/em&gt; for free&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jygWTr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge!","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20756891/mystery-bag-gear-books-backpack-twitter-entry-giveaway-2019"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="JWnYD3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10875336"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n2SIAt"&gt;There are currently three different models of Apple’s AirPods available for a steep discount. The stellar AirPods Pro with their wireless MagSafe charging case are currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/ref=fs_a_mdt2_us1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bJTsinOP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $190, taking $60 off the original retail price. We’ve seen slightly better deals on the previous iteration that doesn’t support MagSafe, but this is the first big price break we’ve seen for this newer model that does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e9r1lu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871605"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFUMWM"&gt;The third generation of AirPods that debuted just a month ago are already receiving discounts. Normally $180, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has these earbuds available for $175&lt;/a&gt; — not much better, we know. But the best offer is available today from Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836602-13140756?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-airpods-3rd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which brings the price down to $170&lt;/a&gt; if you check out with your Amazon Prime membership. Neither of these discounts are particularly big, but any kind of discount on earbuds this new are rare. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="620pKc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10871596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tLLWwt"&gt;I told you we had lots of AirPods deals, right? The second-generation of Apple AirPods equipped with the wireless charging case are available for a limited time at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F20%2F22791348%2Fubisoft-apple-airpods-razer-keyboard-webcam-google-stadia-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for just $135&lt;/a&gt;, and Prime subscribers can get an extra $5 off. This discount doesn’t quite match the lowest price we’ve seen for these earbuds but is substantially cheaper than the next best deal at Walmart, which has &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F482532021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the same model available for $150&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeUFHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868668"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="oStUuI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787892/apple-black-friday-2021-deals-macbook-ipad-airpods-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sn74rk"&gt;The Razer Huntsman Mini is an excellent take on the 60-percent form factor keyboard, stripping it down to the bare essentials. This sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bI09Erkm?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; knocks $40 off the normal MSRP and reduces the Mini with linear switches to just $90. This deal also extends to the clicky switch version which is also available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Huntsman-Mini-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08BFF4C7J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at both retailers for $80&lt;/a&gt;. If you sign in with a My Best Buy account, you can save a few more bucks off the total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uahX5X"&gt;This is the lowest price we’ve seen for this keyboard so far. The small form factor is perfect for anyone striving for that ultra-clean desk aesthetic, but the absence of arrow keys and a function row may pose some difficulty to anyone that's more accustomed to using a fully-sized keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H3Z39b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361276"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCfzUB"&gt;If you’re in need of a webcam, the Razer Kiyo Pro is a solid option available for its lowest price ever at $100. This deal at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-High-Performance/dp/B08T1MWX6J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; takes half off the regular price, while &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bJVETYB3?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $130. The Kiyo Pro discards the small ring light from the standard model but is capable of recording FHD video at 60FPS. Another cool feature that sets this camera apart from the crowd is its ability to adjust its field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="udCKDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730624"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XIuG6"&gt;Google managed to keep the Stadia alive slightly longer than a carnival goldfish, and to celebrate, the Google Stadia Premiere Edition bundle has been discounted to just $22 at the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;. This deal is pretty amazing, even if you don’t end up becoming a Stadia subscriber. This package usually costs $80, making it a bit steep for new adopters. On top of that, Stadia Pro usually costs $10 a month, though new subscribers get a free month of service that gets you access to a rotating library of free games, and discounts on titles you want to keep. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our initial thoughts on the Stadia&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCCHI7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736656"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GOftWP"&gt;Some other cool deals to check out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CBtmpp"&gt;The esports-inspired &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bKs2zv6m?u1=vergenewsletter111921%20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer BlackShark V2 Pro is on sale for just $130&lt;/a&gt;. This $50 price reduction brings the wireless BlackShark down to the lowest price we’ve seen for this aviator-style headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qEwJ3w"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hic8VR4a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Iskur gaming chair&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounted by $150, bringing the price down to just $350. This price break makes this chair more affordable than anything currently offered by the leading gaming chair giant, Secretlab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V0se26"&gt;If the boom mic on your headset just isn’t cutting it anymore, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2hhpZBe0g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Seiren X is currently discounted to $60 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This reduces the regular price by $40, making it the lowest price we’ve seen for this powerful mic. Just note that the discount only extends to the black and pink colorways. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>In her Theranos fraud case, Elizabeth Holmes is speaking for herself</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;From birth to the year 2006 in her first day of testimony&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N6tUok"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, her hair down and her makeup muted relative to her Theranos days, spelled her name for the court. After the prosecution rested its case in the morning, the defense called her as their third witness, about an hour before the end of the day. She wore a navy blazer with a white blouse — not one of the famous black turtlenecks has made an appearance in court during the months the case against her has dragged on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ertv5"&gt;Holmes is facing 11 counts of wire fraud from her time as founder and CEO of Theranos. Though her testimony today is the first time she’s spoken for herself, we’ve heard her voice already — in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22790541/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-lies-recording"&gt;recordings of &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; journalist Roger Parloff&lt;/a&gt;. In those recordings, she lies confidently about her device’s capabilities. And the lies Parloff recorded were consistent with the lies her investors testified that she told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRxqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TPBiGt"&gt;I do not think I am the only person who’s wondered how she’ll explain this. Now, we are going to find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QrX0n"&gt;So far Holmes hasn’t said much — we’ve learned about her education, the time she spent at Stanford, and that she dropped out to form Theranos. When her testimony ended today, we were still in 2006, well before the period the government alleges any fraud took place, which means most of the juicy stuff will have to wait until next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqw2jN"&gt;Holmes was cheerful, smiling at her attorney, Kevin Downey. She seemed relaxed and focused. Everyone I know has &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2019/03/why-did-elizabeth-holmes-use-a-fake-deep-voice.html"&gt;asked me about her voice&lt;/a&gt;. For what it’s worth, the most obnoxious part of The Voice Discourse is that most of these writers have no musical training. She is not and could never have been “baritone,” &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201510/kimberly-weisul/the-longest-game.html"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Inc&lt;/em&gt; wrote &lt;/a&gt;— she’s not even a tenor! — and the idea that she’d go up “&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerryweissman/2019/03/29/elizabeth-holmes-baritone/?sh=2e68ef644b8b"&gt;several octaves&lt;/a&gt;” when she speaks normally, as John Carreyrou writes in &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;, suggests a “real” pitch higher than the &lt;a href="https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/VIDEO-Kristin-Chenoweth-Discusses-Her-Distinctive-Voice-on-CONAN-20180829"&gt;speaking voice of Kristen Chenoweth&lt;/a&gt;. That is nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkwwWO"&gt;Holmes sounds like a normal alto to me, though she has a habit of dropping her voice to punch words she wants to emphasize. Then, she sounds like she has a cold, or perhaps, &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/elizabeth-holmess-fake-voice-is-actually-just-stupid-ma-1833402366"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Jezebel&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;put it, like she’s using her “impression of a stupid man” voice. If it’s an affectation, it’s one she’s had so long that it’s natural to her now. In any event, most of her speech isn’t at the bottom of her range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ifiuqb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The voice is part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzN3yX"&gt;But the voice is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656190/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-trial-founder-myth"&gt;part of the famous Holmes persona&lt;/a&gt;, which I expect we will be hearing more about in the coming days. The defense has indicated that they expect to continue questioning her all next week; if the prosecution’s cross-exam is shorter than two days, I will be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp6ymp"&gt;The story Holmes told in her testimony is well-known. She dropped out of Stanford and used the rest of the money her parents had saved from her college education, as well as some debt and some money from family friends, to found a company called Real-Time Cures. She later changed the name to Theranos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDM9yU"&gt;Originally, the idea was to create a pill or patch, one that would analyze a person’s blood, allowing for more-precise medication dosing. But people seemed more interested in a tabletop device for blood analysis, rather than a pill or patch, so she switched her focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lULKt4"&gt;She raised money from Don Lucas, an investor best known for his association with Oracle, and Larry Ellison, among others. Lucas wanted to speak to some of the pharmaceutical companies Theranos had been working with as part of his due diligence, so we were shown a 2005 email where Holmes introduced Lucas to someone she’d been working with at Pfizer. We also saw the reply: that he’d be happy to talk to Lucas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="196Kng"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We nailed this one.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="69qe1M"&gt;With the money Holmes raised, she created a device called Theranos 1.0, a photo of which was displayed for the courtroom, and which to me looked like someone had attached a thick antenna to a gray printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjTm5m"&gt;During that time, the business plan was to work with drug companies on their clinical trials. She spoke to Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Bristol Myers Squibb. Theranos signed agreements with GSK in September 2006, and with Pfizer in November 2006. The company also did demos for Novartis and Eli Lilly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhiCXK"&gt;We were even shown an email from Holmes to the entire staff at Theranos about the Novartis demo. In the November 19, 2006 email, she wrote, “We nailed this one. You all did an incredible job in making this happen — this is the Theranos way. We are on a roll to do what we need to do next month and in ‘07.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PcfOs"&gt;We also saw a 2006 email from Holmes to Bob Grady, a partner at the Carlyle Group, when Holmes was raising money. In it, she lists people at Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Novartis he can talk to if he wants to confirm their work with Theranos. Not all investors asked for this information, she testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="UZtLhS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kSim4Q"&gt;And then we broke for the day. The period in which the government alleges fraud took place is still ahead of us. We know from&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt; the opening statements&lt;/a&gt; Holmes may blame Sunny Balwani, her co-defendant who is being tried separately; the defense suggested that her mistake was trusting him too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSyJDJ"&gt;She may also allege that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-holmes-might-claim-abusive-relationship-in-criminal-fraud-defense-11630167496"&gt;he abused her&lt;/a&gt;. In court filings unsealed in August, she alleged that he controlled what she ate, how she dressed, and all her communications. (Balwani denies this.) The abuse allegations explain why the two are being tried separately; an expert on abusive relationships, Mindy Mechanic, is on the defense’s witness  list, though she may not be called. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2SxYdE"&gt;In her coming testimony, which I expect to be lengthy, I look forward to her explanation for the &lt;em&gt;remarkably consistent&lt;/em&gt; lies several people testified to — that Theranos devices were used in Afghanistan and on military helicopters, that Theranos devices could perform more than 200 tests, and that the company did not use competitors’ machines for tests. I am particularly interested in the coming cross-examination, when the government can use her extensive body of statements, including those in the press, to ask her questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="clUIXx"&gt;But right now, we’ve just heard the story of a fledgling startup — one that would not be interesting or unusual if it were not for how the company ended.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In a surprise move, Elizabeth Holmes is testifying at the Theranos fraud trial </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3MKqmk"&gt;Elizabeth Holmes, the founder and CEO of disgraced blood-testing company Theranos, took the stand in her own defense late Friday, in a surprise move by the defense team. Holmes is being tried on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, for allegedly misleading investors and patients about Theranos’ blood testing device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLQMHD"&gt;Holmes took the stand just after 6PM ET on Friday, to the surprise of most in the courtroom. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Liz Lopatto, who has been covering the trial, said Holmes seemed relaxed as she answered questions about her background and the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="phLMq2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;holmes has been smiling a lot on the stand. she seems relaxed. a lot of you have been asking me about her voice. it doesn’t sound that low to me? but when she punches a syllable for emphasis, she drops her pitch.&lt;/p&gt;— Elizabeth Lopatto (@mslopatto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mslopatto/status/1461838422113325060?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACO7WA"&gt;Theranos was once valued at around $9 billion before investigative reporter John Carreyrou wrote an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;expose for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that said the company wasn’t using its own device for the blood tests it was conducting, and company employees were concerned the device wasn’t accurate. After more &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reports showed that the company’s tests were faulty and it &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-voids-two-years-of-edison-blood-test-results-1463616976"&gt;voided two years of results&lt;/a&gt; from its Edison blood-testing device, Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-bans-theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmes-from-operating-labs-for-two-years-1467956064"&gt;banned from operating labs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/health/theranos-shutting-down.html"&gt;Theranos dissolved in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohr0Kv"&gt;The government rested its case on Friday morning, after several weeks, during which dozens of witnesses testified about Holmes and the work Theranos did. Her defense team is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646130/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;expected to argue that Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani,&lt;/a&gt; Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and business partner at Theranos, was abusive toward her and “that any success she achieved was because of him.” Balwani is being tried separately next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google seeks recusal probe for incoming antitrust chief over Yelp and Microsoft cases</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YI7kXl"&gt;Google sent a letter to the Department of Justice Friday requesting that the department examine whether newly confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786079/google-jonathan-kanter-justice-department-antitrust-division-facebook-lina-khan"&gt;antitrust division head Jonathan Kanter&lt;/a&gt;, who has been a vocal critic of the search giant, should be recused from federal antitrust investigations into Google. In his new role, Kanter will lead the department’s lawsuit against Google alleging it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;a monopoly in the search and advertising markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaicTK"&gt;Kanter has represented a number of companies in motions against Google, which the search giant argues should disqualify him. Most notably, Kanter represented Microsoft in a motion arguing against Google’s acquisition of DoubleClick, which was eventually approved by regulators and was closed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UPmdo"&gt;“Mr. Kanter’s past statements and work representing competitors who have advocated for the cases brought by the Department raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. You can read Google’s full letter to the DOJ at the bottom of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haoTal"&gt;Kanter is the latest in a string of prominent antitrust appointments from the Biden administration, which also include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Lina Khan’s confirmation&lt;/a&gt; as the chair of the Federal Trade Commission and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;Tim Wu’s role&lt;/a&gt; working on technology and competition policy at the National Economic Council. Notably, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557456/amazon-lina-khan-recusal-petition-federal-trade-commission-antitrust"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576926/facebook-seeks-ftc-chair-lina-khan-refusal-antitrust-case"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; sought to force Lina Khan to recuse herself from their cases on similar grounds, although, so far, the efforts have had little result.&lt;/p&gt;
