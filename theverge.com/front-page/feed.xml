    <title>Google TV rolls out new Watch With Me series for celeb-curated streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYZOJbT0gFUKB0idwykUSRprMxA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529501/Laverne_Cox_Google_TV_UI.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g1QBAY"&gt;Evidently acknowledging our collective content fatigue, Google TV has announced a new celebrity-curated Watch With Me series that should make finding something to binge a little less painful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z6gOXg"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/google-tv/watchwithme-lavernecox"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href="https://goo.gle/3gRFjFe"&gt;Watch With Me&lt;/a&gt; series will spotlight series and movies loved by entertainers and artists. In addition to Watch With Me showcasing celebrities’ favorite flicks, the series will feature interviews with those curators about why they hand-selected a specific title to be featured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KA3PlW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Celebrities and artists will handpick their favorite titles to help you find something to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p3Vutr"&gt;Google TV’s algorithm is fairly good at surfacing relevant titles, but the idea is to allow these hosts to guide users specifically through a collection of movies that inspired them. The hub is yet another place to find something good to watch, and the added contextualization of each film may help introduce users to a title they may have missed on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp3EkH"&gt;Google TV isn’t the first to spotlight titles with celebrity-curated hubs. HBO Max uses the format to spotlight favorites from featured personalities like Gal Gadot and Zack Snyder, and YouTube has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jimmyfallon/status/995059982893797376"&gt;similarly experimented&lt;/a&gt; with the format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mDaKM"&gt;Google TV’s new series will kick off with a collection selected by actress Laverne Cox, who chose titles like &lt;em&gt;Moonlight&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Color Purple&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pretty in Pink&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt;, among other groundbreaking films. Google says users will be seeing the watchlist “over the next few days,” and when you have it, it can be found in the For You section of the platform. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch a police officer admit to playing Taylor Swift to keep a video off YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7FiXKtWmKafKf16GxoylEUWPEGk=/241x0:1294x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529496/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_6.17.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image from the Anti-Police Terror Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WP4JV2"&gt;A confrontation Tuesday between a police sergeant and member of the public didn’t start out unusually. James Burch, policy director of the Anti Police-Terror Project (APTP), was standing outside the Alameda Courthouse in Oakland, California when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. As the two argued, the sergeant noticed he was being filmed. Then, he pulled out his phone and started playing “Blank Space” by Taylor Swift — in an apparent play to exploit copyright takedowns and keep the video off social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kDirp"&gt;“You can record all you want,” he said, according to a video obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I just know it can’t be posted to YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dblwjc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmZmo81Cdcc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mAQscq"&gt;Bystanders have a First Amendment right to record police, but police officers &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/are-cops-playing-copyrighted-music-while-being-recorded-to-trigger-takedowns"&gt;have allegedly tried to exploit&lt;/a&gt; copyright law to prevent people from sharing those videos, playing music that could trigger a takedown notice. While playing music in the background of a video isn’t necessarily against YouTube’s rules, it can set off the company’s automatic takedown system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGVbOJ"&gt;In February, activist Sennett Devermont documented a Beverly Hills officer blasting Sublime’s “Santeria” on his phone after being asked questions, apparently to make the video more difficult to post online. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/bvxb94/is-this-beverly-hills-cop-playing-sublimes-santeria-to-avoid-being-livestreamed"&gt;Devermont told &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that this wasn’t an isolated incident, sharing an earlier video where a different officer used the same tactic with a Beatles song.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bvcvvr"&gt;In both cases, though, the officer didn’t directly admit to the practice. The Beverly Hills Police Department said playing music while answering questions is “not a procedure that has been recommended by Beverly Hills Police command staff” and that the videos were “currently under review.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaa09"&gt;Now, there is explicit evidence of a police officer admitting to playing a popular song in order to keep a video off of YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHEiDc"&gt;Burch was at the courthouse on June 29th to support the family of Steven Taylor, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/san-leandro-shooting-walmart-police-steven-taylor"&gt;killed by San Leandro police officer Jason Fletcher&lt;/a&gt; while having a mental health crisis at Walmart. (Fletcher was later &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/us/California-Walmart-shooting-Jason-Fletcher-Steven-Taylor.html"&gt;charged with felony manslaughter&lt;/a&gt;.) He was listening to the pre-trial hearing with members of the Justice 4 Steven Taylor campaign when an officer approached him and asked him to move a banner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIomY8"&gt;“You’re saying there’s a genuine concern we have that someone’s going to trip on this banner?“ Burch asked, according to the video. “You can’t keep twisting this...” the sergeant responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC9DHE"&gt;“This is as triggering as a situation can be for the family,” Burch tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “In our opinion a cop murdered their brother. Now we have cops marching out here telling us what to do? That is infuriating.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VegYV"&gt;When the sergeant whipped out his phone and started playing Taylor Swift, Burch was taken aback. “Are we having a dance party now?” he asked. “No, sir,” the sergeant said. “Are you playing pop music to drown out the conversation?” another APTP member asked. “No,” the sergeant responded. “He doesn’t want you recording so he’s playing music in the back,” Burch said. On camera, the officer said recording was fine — but posting it online wouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqF1FH"&gt;“The fact that these members of the Alameda County Sheriff’s Department would go to such lengths to deny us the ability to publicize their actions speaks volumes to how they perceive their relationship with the People of Oakland,” Burch said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pC6I02"&gt;Police aren’t the only ones interested in exploiting online copyright systems. In 2019, one Twitter user posted a “tip” for deplatforming fascists by playing music at rallies, then reporting videos of it when they were posted online. Copyright reform advocate &lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2019/07/23/double-edged-swords-r-us.html"&gt;Cory Doctorow called the idea&lt;/a&gt; a “clever hack,” but he called out its potential for abuse by other groups, specifically including police looking to avoid scrutiny online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns0Fxg"&gt;Social networks and copyright holders employ sometimes byzantine and often automated processes for detecting and removing copyrighted content. Users can appeal takedowns, but if they fail, receiving multiple strikes can limit an account’s monetization options or even get the user suspended. Meanwhile, automated systems can be overzealous at spotting supposed piracy, flagging even &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42580523"&gt;videos of white noise&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/copyright-bots-and-classical-musicians-are-fighting-online-the-bots-are-winning/2020/05/20/a11e349c-98ae-11ea-89fd-28fb313d1886_story.html"&gt;public domain classical music&lt;/a&gt;. They can also fail to identify videos that do include copyrighted material but would likely be protected as legal fair use. That’s made the system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220032/youtube-copystrike-blackmail-three-strikes-copyright-violation"&gt;ripe for abuse&lt;/a&gt; by scammers and other bad actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCv6kP"&gt;Videos like APTP’s don’t necessarily violate social media rules, but those rules aren’t very clear. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company’s restrictions take into consideration how much of the total video contains recorded music, the total number of songs in the video, and the length of individual songs in the video. In 2019, YouTube introduced a policy that discouraged copyright holders from claiming revenue on videos including brief or “unintentional” music clips, although it said that could temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806189/youtube-manual-music-copyright-claim-update-more-blocked-videos"&gt;lead to more blocked videos&lt;/a&gt;. Google declined to comment on how its policies would cover the Oakland video, instead pointing&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/our-commitments/safeguarding-copyright/"&gt;a page on how it protects copyrighted content&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzpg38"&gt;To Burch, the officer’s attempt to trigger a copyright takedown underlines why it’s important to film police interactions in the first place. “We know these agencies seek to avoid accountably,” he says. “It’s our job to be prepared in any situation to do the best we can to make sure the people in our community stay safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzLdKx"&gt;The Alameda County Sheriff’s Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Student gets Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9ZIsjpXHIFhT5T2k5_uahCiMQU=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529203/HBkcxKy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Gustave Monce (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSaJfudt8S4" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKcXLk"&gt;The Windows 11 preview only got released earlier this week, but a student has already managed to get Microsoft’s latest operating system running on a Windows Phone. Engineering student &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gus33000"&gt;Gustave Monce has created&lt;/a&gt; a brief video demonstrating Windows 11 running on a Lumia 950 XL, one of the first devices to ship with Windows 10 Mobile. It was also one of Microsoft’s last Windows-powered phones before the company ended support for its mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RjMMd"&gt;Windows 11 adapts surprisingly well for the 5.7-inch display, but the same can’t be said for the speed of animations. While Windows 11 is usable on the Lumia 950 XL, it doesn’t look like something you’d want to pull out of your pocket every day. But that’s not really the point. This is the latest achievement in a five-year hobby of tinkering with getting full versions of Windows running on Windows Phone devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXS2I8"&gt;“It all started really 5 years ago, when Windows 10 Mobile was near obsolescence,” says Monce, speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Monce teamed up with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/imbushuo"&gt;Bingxing Wang&lt;/a&gt;, a fellow engineer, to bring the idea of running full Windows on these phones to life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgFXxr"&gt;“As time went on and we started talking about it, discussion groups formed and in turn we had a community of people interested in running full Windows 10 on Lumia 950s,” explains Monce. “We’re now basically a team of about 15 people, and we’ve made a lot of progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sh9xm85B_jjBxfNHsDUAYBufdT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693469/ezgif.com_gif_maker.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/" target="_blank"&gt;Lumia WOA Project&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11 can still run on a Windows Phone from five years ago.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zi3Jbh"&gt;The team has ported and reverse-engineered drivers to get Windows 11 running on a Windows Phone and even written their own ones, too. “I wouldn’t say we were quite fast to do it, we took four years to get to the current state, but it’s actually impressive we got here with not much documentation on hand,” says Monce. “Because of all that work for Windows 10 and the work we previously did to support Windows 10X, Windows 11 was a natural path forward, and really didn’t take much to get going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0ILT9"&gt;Monce and the team have &lt;a href="https://woa-project.github.io/LumiaWOA/status/"&gt;built a dedicated site for their project&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes tools, guides, and documentation on bringing Windows 10 and Windows 11 to these old Windows Phones. Not everything works perfectly, with the cameras failing to function, a hit to battery life, and calls / SMS occasionally breaking due to Microsoft’s OS changes. It’s more of a fun project to see just how far engineers and developers can push the devices that Microsoft has abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ae2d8l"&gt;It’s also a project that reminds me of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/19/12968306/htc-hd2-android-7-immortal"&gt;age-defying HTC HD2 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. Developers and engineers kept HTC’s legendary Windows Mobile device going for a solid decade, with custom Android ROMs, mods, and even a port of Windows Phone 8 for the device. The Lumia 950 series is nearly five years old, and the fact that a team of people has ported Windows 11 to it is proof that there’s life in the old phone yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest bans weight loss ads due to eating disorder concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGpbHleRB0O5uFxQZWBwkTA-czA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69529105/akrales_170802_1743_0198.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yxcQr"&gt;Pinterest &lt;a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-embraces-body-acceptance-with-new-ad-policy"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it is updating its ad policies to “prohibit all ads with weight loss language and imagery.” The company said in a blog post that it developed its new policy with guidance from the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA), whose research shows there has been a &lt;a href="https://uncexchanges.org/2020/06/01/the-early-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-with-eating-disorders/"&gt;rise in eating disorders&lt;/a&gt; and unhealthy eating habits in young people during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEom8r"&gt;“Pinterest is the place people come for inspiration to create life they love,” the blog post reads. “It’s where everyone belongs—regardless of body shape or size. We’re empowering Pinners to plan for a summer and beyond without weight loss ads, so they can focus on what matters most.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJIbPU"&gt;The company claims it is the “only major platform to prohibit all weight loss ads,” and that the new rules build on the company’s existing ad policies against body shaming and weight loss scams. In 2019, Instagram restricted weight loss content and certain types of cosmetic surgery from being seen by users under age 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlXUhv"&gt;Beginning Thursday, Pinterest’s policy will prohibit: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2T78L6"&gt;Any weight loss language or imagery&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dphh7P"&gt;Any testimonials regarding weight loss or weight loss products&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x5SmQq"&gt;Any language or imagery that idealizes or denigrates certain body types&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4kijb6"&gt;Referencing body mass index or similar indices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ogl6ao"&gt;Any products that claim weight loss through something worn or applied to the skin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="iHpNa5"&gt;Ads for weight loss or appetite suppressant pills, before-and-after weight loss imagery, weight loss procedures like liposuction or fat burning, body shaming, and “unrealistic” claims about cosmetic results were already banned under the policy, the company added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJk9Bg"&gt;Elizabeth Thompson, interim CEO for NEDA, applauded the move. “NEDA is encouraged by this necessary step in prioritizing the mental health and well-being of Pinners, especially those impacted by diet culture, body shaming, and eating disorders,” she said in a statement. “We are hopeful this global policy will encourage other organizations and companies to reflect on potentially harmful ad messages and to establish their own working policies that will create meaningful change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9bDYN"&gt;Pinterest has been one of the more forward-thinking social media platforms when it comes to reining in harmful or misleading content in its ads. In 2016, it prohibited ads for “sensitive content including cultural appropriated and inappropriate costumes.” It stopped running political ads in 2018, and in 2019, Pinterest was one of the first social media companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/2/21/18234052/pinterest-bans-anti-vaccination-search-results-youtube"&gt;block anti-vaccination&lt;/a&gt; content, to prevent misinformation from spreading on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJFK3q"&gt;Earlier this year the company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382148/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act-sb331-discrimination-harassment"&gt;end the use of nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; (NDAs) when employees leave the company, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;settlement with its former COO&lt;/a&gt; who had alleged gender discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEfEeo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3Xtet"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s iOS app has a secret pinball Easter egg now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7chmpE3ByTsLXOEbWNIQBeMFLkg=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528947/Google_pinball.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G8Qd91"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942"&gt;Google app on iOS&lt;/a&gt; appears to have gotten a new Easter egg: a rather entertaining little pinball app hidden away in the “Tabs” menu. The game appears to have been added a few weeks ago, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5FFdPL7X8"&gt;several YouTube videos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/o2ak9i/the_google_app_on_ios_has_this_neat_easter_egg/"&gt;a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEYRIm"&gt;Opening the pinball game is simple: switch over to the Tabs, uh, tab in Google’s iOS app, clear out any open tabs, and then wait for the colorful shapes to start creeping up from the bottom of the screen. Swipe up on those shapes, and you’ll launch a surprisingly full-featured pinball game directly in the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KFXkk6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A surprisingly good pinball game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TVeeVS"&gt;Gameplay actually works like a mix of pinball and &lt;em&gt;Brick Breaker&lt;/em&gt;, with each level spawning a variety of colorful shapes that shrink and eventually vanish with each hit. Each level adds new bumper variations and more shapes to the mix, and there are even power-ups: a heart adds an extra life, a blue star splits the pinball into two, and a yellow star makes the ball larger and easier to hit. It also works offline, in the event that you’re stuck on a plane or subway and somehow manage to only have the Google app on your phone for internet-less entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqgNm"&gt;Is there a real purpose to the pinball Easter egg? Not really. (The same could be said of regular pinball, I suppose.) But the existential nature of pinball is beyond the scope of this blog post — besides, I need to go back and try to beat my high score. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the watchOS 8 public beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f0JZyAt5kcMb6KUSfZfeeVP1B4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528940/vpavic_200929_4216_0128.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6, in Product Red color.&lt;/em&gt; | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6d4Phv"&gt;Apple has now released public betas for iOS 15, iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and soon macOS Monterey. We’ve covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;how to get the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 betas here&lt;/a&gt; — follow along below if you’re interested in testing out the latest Apple Watch software, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdurFM"&gt;WatchOS 8 is expected to get a full, stable release this fall. It brings a handful of new features, including more workout types in the Fitness app, a new Mindfulness app, a watchface that works with Portrait Mode photos taken on an iPhone, as well as improved weather and smart home apps, among other things. It’s compatible with the Series 3, Series 4, Series 5, Series 6, and SE Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ukj6DG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Eo25aP"&gt;Before we go through how to install the beta, there are some important things you should know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="DlhMVb"&gt;Beta software is often buggy and you might have issues with third-party apps. Some bugs might include poor performance and bad battery life, an area the Apple Watch isn’t great at even with stable software. It’s best to try it out on a secondary watch if you have one (which, admittedly, most people don’t).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t4AYKj"&gt;Unlike the iOS and iPadOS betas, there’s no way to revert to the stable version of watchOS 7 if you install the watchOS 8 beta. If it’s buggy and not functioning well for you, you’re stuck with it until Apple releases the stable version in the fall. That’s probably enough of a reason to stay away from this one, particularly if you rely on your Apple Watch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="EInlh9"&gt;If those don’t scare you away, here’s how to install the watchOS 8 beta on an Apple Watch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Lslpir"&gt;Before you can install the watchOS 8 beta, you must have the iOS 15 beta installed on your iPhone. Go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;follow these directions&lt;/a&gt; and come back here when you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TU9jFz"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software page&lt;/a&gt; in Safari on your iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4sTCZE"&gt;Log in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8rmJ65"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Get Started” link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xb8SJ8"&gt;Tap the watchOS 8 tab at the top of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3iy1P2"&gt;Select “enroll your Apple Watch” in the Get Started section of the watchOS 8 tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Z0J81u"&gt;Scroll down and tap the “Download Profile” button and then select “allow” on the pop-up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vNrgIX"&gt;Install the beta profile in the Watch app on your iPhone, which should automatically open once the profile is downloaded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qYnM9B"&gt;You will be prompted to reboot your Apple Watch. Tap the button to allow this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8lumGX"&gt;Once the Apple Watch is rebooted, go to the Watch app, tap “General,” tap “Software Update.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6n7DA9"&gt;You should see the watchOS 8 beta ready to be installed on your watch. Tap “Install” to proceed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i0EOG4"&gt;The software update will download to your phone and then transfer to the watch. To complete installation, the watch needs to be on its charger, within range of your iPhone, connected to Wi-Fi, and with 50 percent or more charge. If all of those criteria are not met, it will pause the installation until the watch is ready.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ9wJX"&gt;Once the beta software is installed, the watch will reboot itself and you’ll be all set to use it. In our experience, some complications and third-party apps did not function until they were opened manually on the watch or the watch was rebooted a second time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU officially launches digital vaccine passport</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vcfzi0eEX0fH3tHVzKPw4MO4NtY=/8x0:716x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528891/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_9.49.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9TkaY1"&gt;The European Union’s &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/"&gt;digital COVID-19 certificate&lt;/a&gt; officially launched today. The certificate allows people to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination, a recent negative test result, or a past COVID-19 infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCP8fb"&gt;The certificate, which includes a QR code and digital signature, can either be displayed on a digital device or printed out. People who have the certificate &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/coronavirus/eu-digital-covid-certificate/"&gt;should not&lt;/a&gt; have to get an additional COVID-19 test or quarantine when traveling in the EU. The certificate only recognizes COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the EU — that includes the AstraZeneca, Pfizer / BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duZQRD"&gt;Some countries in the EU have already been issuing and recognizing the certificate. Germany, for example, said in mid-June that it had already issued 5 million certificates. There will be a six-week phase-in period to get the rest of the EU member countries online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2eBgb"&gt;Countries not in the EU, like the UK, have started rolling out their own systems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;England has its own COVID-19 pass through the National Health Service (NHS), which can also show proof of vaccination, recent test result, or past infection. People in Scotland and Wales can get a paper version. The EU &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-57665765"&gt;does not&lt;/a&gt; currently recognize the NHS pass, although some individual countries within the EU do, and that could change as countries work to make the systems compatible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjHzXC"&gt;Some states in the United States (like &lt;a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;) have their own COVID-19 vaccine certificates. &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2021/03/17/walmart-empowering-individuals-with-access-to-digital-health-records-in-partnership-with-the-commons-project-foundation-and-clear"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; rolled out a digital record for people who were vaccinated at its stores. But there isn’t a nationwide system in the US. In March, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356333/covid-vaccine-certification-passport-biden"&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; was working on plans to organize and streamline the various certificate projects. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558245/google-pay-covid-vaccination-card-android-digital-pass"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; it was adding support for vaccine cards to Android. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CQyQ_asFQEO/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by Jeff Bezos (@jeffbezos)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5TePh"&gt;Funk brings the crew size for New Shepard’s debut flight carrying humans on July 20th to four, including Bezos, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;his brother Mark&lt;/a&gt;, and a yet-to-be-named passenger who paid $28 million for their trip to space in an auction that closed last month. Bezos’ presence on the first flight is seen as a show of confidence in New Shepard’s safety.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNzGIg"&gt;Funk’s inclusion as an “honored guest” is the latest symbolic move to inaugurate Blue Origin’s space tourism program — the July 20th date is the anniversary of the first US Moon landing, and the New Shepard capsule is named after Alan Shepard, the first American astronaut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Rto85"&gt;“In 1961, Wally Funk was at the top of her class as part of the ‘Mercury 13’ Woman in Space Program,” Bezos said on Instagram. “Despite completing their training, the program was cancelled, and none of the thirteen flew.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdBygS"&gt;“It’s time. Welcome to the crew, Wally. We’re excited to have you fly with us on July 20th as our honored guest.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTMcMw"&gt;Funk, 82, was an &lt;a href="https://www.ninety-nines.org/wally-funk.htm"&gt;iconic aviator in the mid-20th century&lt;/a&gt; and one of 13 women to graduate from the privately funded &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/mercury-13.html"&gt;Women in Space Program&lt;/a&gt;, where she underwent rigorous astronaut training but was ultimately never able to go to space. When NASA opened its astronaut applications up to women in 1976, Funk applied three times but was turned down each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhungw"&gt;Funk’s space enthusiasm hasn’t died. She’s also booked a front row seat on the suborbital SpaceShipTwo plane from Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson’s space tourism firm that competes with Bezos’ Blue Origin, &lt;a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/wally-funk-couldnt-go-to-space/"&gt;according&lt;/a&gt; to the magazine &lt;em&gt;Texas Monthly&lt;/em&gt;. Like New Shepard, SpaceShipTwo flies to the edge of space roughly 62 miles high, the internationally recognized marker for space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Insignia batteries are steeply discounted at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w0XaZjmpNSuNQ9YEQsXw4lmKafM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528741/VRG_DSN_2802_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, the batteries won’t look as cool as this one.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17675660/lithium-ion-battery-science-future-phone" target="_blank"&gt;The Battery Issue&lt;/a&gt; | Artist: William Joel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wWpyVf"&gt;Batteries don’t usually come cheap, so if you have lots of battery-operated gadgets and remotes, you might want to stock up during Best Buy’s big sale happening today. Many of the store’s alkaline batteries from in-house brand Insignia are over half off their usual price. &lt;s&gt;The most appealing offer is the &lt;/s&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744985330143714301" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;s&gt;33-piece assortment pack for $7&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;s&gt; (usually $20) that includes 12 AAA, 12 AA, four C, and four D batteries, with one 9V battery&lt;/s&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNtC5m"&gt;If you just need more commonly sized batteries, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744985436201418639" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a 36-pack of AA and AAA batteries&lt;/a&gt; that includes 24 AA and 12 AAA batteries for $5.95 (usually $16.99). Best Buy has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744985494595613270" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;other varieties of batteries on sale today&lt;/a&gt;, including AAAA and coin batteries for watches, if you want to take a look yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HiO4WU"&gt;Through July 4th, you can get a great deal on Razer’s Basilisk Ultimate wireless gaming mouse that includes a charging dock at Best Buy. It’s usually $169 for the mouse itself, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744797868968846237#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get it for $129&lt;/a&gt; — better yet, this deal includes a $50 Steam gift card. That gift card might come in handy if you’ve had your eye on a few deals in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549213/valve-steam-summer-sale-halo-sekiro-hades-horizon-zero-dawn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Steam’s Summer Sale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IuFMbN"&gt;
&lt;p id="VziQq0"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Laptop Go is discounted at Best Buy, but just so you know, it isn’t quite the lowest price we’ve seen yet for the 12.4-inch laptop. The base model in each color with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $598.49&lt;/a&gt;, down from $700. We’ve seen it sell for $30 less, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/16/22535346/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-apple-watch-nintendo-switch-online-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but only once&lt;/a&gt; before at B&amp;amp;H Photo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAUpQu"&gt;It’s understandable that you might want more storage space, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986505054972304" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the model with a 256GB SSD costs $750&lt;/a&gt;. That previous deal at B&amp;amp;H that I just told you about offered this model for a much better price of $679. Still, if you missed out, today’s sale isn’t too bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e28fmF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="t4rHA2"&gt;
&lt;p id="fg5Csl"&gt;A pair of Mackie CR3-XBT monitors with Bluetooth and three-inch woofers is $10 off its usual price today at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1567494-REG%2Fmackie_cr3_xbt_silver_3_multimedia_monitor_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F7%2F1%2F22558874%2Finsignia-batteries-razer-basilisk-ultimate-steam-microsoft-surface-laptop-go-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mackie-CR-Studio-Monitor-CR3-XBT/dp/B083N7PBL5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The limited edition silver-trimmed CR3-XBT is available for $110 at B&amp;amp;H Photo, while Amazon has the neon green-trimmed model for the same price. These might be a good fit for your work desk or for your entertainment center to play records.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles looks like the perfect starting point for newcomers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TdxBK5Vo-tQnCJrnIKoJ7bEy9A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69528650/TGAAC_Objection_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ysi52O"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series is one of gaming’s great pleasures, mashing up courtroom drama with anime sensibilities into something dramatic, heartwarming, and silly in equal measure. But if you’re a new player, it can be tough to know where to start. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;the original trilogy starring Phoenix Wright&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/4/6105281/professor-layton-vs-phoenix-wright"&gt;a handful of spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/10/12866404/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-spirit-of-justice-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;more recent titles&lt;/a&gt; that further the story of a hapless defense attorney with a heart of gold. It’s like jumping into a long-running soap opera and having to quickly catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHHwy7"&gt;But it looks like a solution is almost here: Capcom is set to launch a prequel called &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; that offers the same tone and gameplay without all of the narrative baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7785xb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; is actually a compilation of two games that originally launched in Japan a few years back but have finally received a proper English localization. I had the chance to play through the first few chapters — there are 10 altogether — and the game plays out much like the rest of the series. That means most of your time is spent in a courtroom, where you’ll be meticulously going through statements and evidence in search of any contradictions you can find. In practice, this involves a lot of reading; &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; games play out mostly like a visual novel, with little breaks for investigating crime scenes or evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qQqsq0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqAfvqsCaKg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9pPLE"&gt;The twist in &lt;em&gt;Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; is that it takes place at the dawn of the Meiji period, when Japan first began opening itself up to Western influence in things like art, science, and, yes, law. At the outset of the game, the whole idea of a judge, lawyers, and jury is still relatively new. This gives the game an interesting aesthetic, and it’s fun to listen to characters marvel at things like photographs or anesthesia. But more importantly, it offers a completely clean slate: you don’t have to know anything about Phoenix Wright, Miles Edgeworth, or any other &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; characters to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ILjmpl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How games like Final Fantasy XII and Phoenix Wright are translated into English","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523106/final-fantasy-12-phoenix-wright-translation-localization-alex-o-smith-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N81LPy"&gt;Despite the lack of familiar faces, the game retains the same charm — at least from what I’ve played. The very first case introduces the new protagonist, a law student named Ryunosuke Naruhodo, who has been accused of killing a visiting professor from Great Britain and is forced to defend himself. The trial is both intense and ridiculous. A key piece of evidence involves &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; a steak was eaten, and one of the key witnesses is a soldier who appears to be controlled by a baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJ1WO8"&gt;As always, slowly breaking these witnesses down by presenting contradictions is extremely satisfying, especially as each character will visibly change in elaborate ways to match their mental state. (The game retains the same 3D visual style as the previous &lt;em&gt;Spirit of Justice&lt;/em&gt;, which means these moments are particularly outlandish.) The game even gets serious at times; I was pleasantly surprised to see small moments that touched on the racism and sexism of the time. Much like Phoenix Wright before him, Naruhodo has a real lovable loser vibe that you can’t help but root for. The first time he yells “Objection!” is totally heart-warming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnw1Lc"&gt;What’s great about the game, at least so far, is that it translates the things I love about the series — the sense of humor, the melodrama, the over-the-top characters, the thrill of connecting the dots — but in a completely new environment. As a longtime fan, it’s been refreshing. But for new players? It’s the ideal place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAHQry"&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches July 27th on the PS4, Switch, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
