    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK-mSuFuVOg5iUNkHQdRI1SwPYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953803/IMG_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hinge adds voice notes and voice prompts to dating profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgAGOlGuswUoUVP9iqnZO04hUMw=/12x0:2036x1349/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051480/Hinge_Voice_Prompts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WJUWB"&gt;Dating app Hinge is adding new audio features, letting users answer the “getting to know you” prompts on their profile using audio clips and exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82pFAg"&gt;The new features will roll out Wednesday globally and are the latest example of apps using voice to add a new dimension to digital dating. Rival services like Bumble and Happn have already added voice notes to their app, and one app, String, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; lets users &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/sex-and-relationships/string-new-dating-app-710735"&gt;communicate with their voice&lt;/a&gt;. For many people, the sound of someone’s voice can be an important part of attraction, and exchanging voice notes is a more expressive way to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3TJ0K6MqT2LB_hb9992ruqyF8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956117/Hinge_Voice_Notes.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be able to exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cjNyRK"&gt;If users want to add a voice prompt to their profile, they should make sure the app is updated, then head to Settings &amp;gt; Edit Profile &amp;gt; Voice Prompt. You can record a voice note for any of Hinge’s regular prompts (questions like worst date stories and favorite random facts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhvpRr"&gt;“Hinge wants to help people get to know you as soon as they see your profile. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, imagine how many your voice is,” said Hinge’s chief product officer Michelle Parsons in a press release. “With the introduction of Voice Prompts, we’re adding more authenticity to the profile experience, allowing users to fully display their personality in a new way.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzIU2sWM9jTd-nqoUNbHC4KQRXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051450/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUpwvb"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pro notch is misbehaving. Early adopters have discovered inconsistencies in how Apple handles the notch across macOS and in individual apps, resulting in unexpected behavior where status bar items can get hidden under the notch. These inconsistencies make it feel like Apple has forgotten, in areas of macOS, that it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;built a notch into the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuMbY"&gt;Snazzy Labs owner Quinn Nelson has posted two videos on Twitter demonstrating some of the early notch issues. The main video demonstrates what appears to be a bug in macOS. Status bar items like Apple’s battery indicator can get hidden underneath the notch when status bar items are extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NQyk9a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS?!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/ADVqmfdqV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ADVqmfdqV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuoITI"&gt;Nelson demonstrates this with iStat Menus, which can be hidden under the notch or can force system items like the battery indicator to be hidden underneath the notch. While Apple has issued guidance to developers on how to work with the notch, the developer behind iStat Menus says the app is just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bjango/status/1453171506263982087"&gt;using standard status items&lt;/a&gt; and that Apple’s dev guidance “won’t solve the issue presented in the video.” This doesn’t appear to be intended behavior, as the notch works differently inside certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTy9Dr"&gt;Nelson also highlights how an older version of DaVinci Resolve avoids the notch. In apps that haven’t been updated for the notch, you can’t even move your mouse pointer into it. Apple blocks off this space so that older apps can’t display menu items underneath the notch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-problem-status-items/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this behavior is inconsistent across the rest of macOS, though, so if you have Finder in focus then the cursor can get lost behind the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYjzzm"&gt;The notch can also exacerbate existing macOS issues. Apps like DaVinci Resolve (with extended menu items) can take over the space used by system status items. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-menu-bar-behavior/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; this is regular macOS behavior, but that the notch obviously reduces the amount of space for both the menu items and status items. It’s an ongoing issue that has spawned apps like &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; to help manage the macOS menu bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fIN0Ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"},{"title":"Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LuBPiE"&gt;It’s not clear how Apple will address these inconsistencies, even as developers update their regular apps to work around the notch. Thankfully, these problems will be extremely rare and will only likely appear in apps with lots of menu or status items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6ji0r"&gt;Either way, it’s odd this wasn’t a design consideration ahead of the MacBook Pro launch. As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1453145302836256771"&gt;Dieter Bohn puts it&lt;/a&gt;: “Soooo the team in charge of Menu Items in apps was read in on the notch, but the team in charge of Menu Status items was not? lol”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WZSfw"&gt;In other words, don’t blame app developers, it’s notch always gonna be their fault.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lightyear’s new trailer turns a cute toy into a sci-fi hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwauFOwRe83ATlwa3ZhAQpO5zwM=/0x67:4096x2798/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051391/LIGHTYEAR_ONLINE_USE_b030_38_pub.pub16.2145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;PIXAR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stoxfp"&gt;Have you ever really wondered about Buzz Lightyear’s origin story? Not the action figure, which helped make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; so beloved, but the actual space ranger? Well, Disney and Pixar sure are hoping so with the upcoming feature &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as “the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear” and the first trailer makes it look like a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-style sci-fi adventure, complete with cool spaceships and futuristic alien worlds. The movie even casts an action movie star, with Chris Evans handling Buzz’s voice. Angus MacLane, who co-directed &lt;em&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/em&gt;, is serving as director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxfJT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; was actually first announced last year, but you’d be forgiven for forgetting about it: the reveal was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;a massive wave of more than 50 updates from Disney&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly marks a shift in tone for both Pixar and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Disney says the movie will be coming out on June 17th, 2022, though it’s not clear if it will be exclusive to theaters or available on Disney Plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DJI announces compact, modular, and magnetic Action 2 camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/071PhW5aKdiG-483cx9Uyb6t6t4=/399x23:1573x806/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051273/DJI_Action_2_KV___Studio_05__Front_touchscreen_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yPkdh6"&gt;DJI has announced a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20751772/dji-osmo-action-camera-gopro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;its Osmo Action camera&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s got a completely new design — the Action 2 drops the Osmo name and focuses on modularity with a suite of additional parts and accessories that attach to the camera magnetically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv5eV7"&gt;The camera module itself is small (it's 39mm square and 22mm deep) and includes a 12MP sensor capable of 4K recording, a lens that provides a 155-degree field of view, and a 1.76-inch OLED touchscreen covered by Gorilla Glass. Using magnets, you can attach another touchscreen (which also boosts the battery life and adds an array of microphones), an extra battery, or a variety of mounts that let you attach it to tripods or GoPro mounts, or even wear the camera as a necklace.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/muAws1fM7O7lhhVH_TZ77UWUsCw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954848/DJI_Action_2___Power_Module__back_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Modules, like the one that adds extra battery power, attach with both magnets and physical clips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T8eDmf"&gt;Speaking of GoPro, any action cam is going to face comparisons, and the Action 2’s specs fall short when put side by side with those of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;the recent Hero10 Black&lt;/a&gt;: it can do 4K at 120 frames per second like the Hero10 but lacks any higher-resolution options (the Hero10 can do 5.3K60), and its 240fps super slow-motion runs at 1080p instead of the GoPro’s 2.7K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6bhzA"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that the Action 2 is &lt;em&gt;tiny&lt;/em&gt; in comparison — it weighs just 53 grams, which is almost exactly a third the weight of the Hero10. DJI also includes 32GB of built-in storage (expandable with a microSD card), something the GoPro lacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbzL8q"&gt;There’s also the system of magnetic accessories DJI is working on, which lets you customize your camera in a way that’s not really possible with the GoPro. If you need a second screen or more battery, you can just snap them on — and then take them off when you want a compact or discreet camera. Other accessories, like a headband or magnetic ball-mount adapter that can be attached to tripods, are similar to GoPro accessories but will (in theory) be easier to attach to and detach from the camera. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhLIOxY8OyUT8qEVXVoasWo8dME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22954849/DJI_Action_2___Camera_Unit___Front_Touchscreen_Module__back_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DJI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Action 2 has a touchscreen on the back, and the front screen module lets you add another one, as well as augmenting the camera’s single microphone with three others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQFXUf"&gt;The Action 2 also has action cam table-stakes features like electronic stabilization, horizon leveling, and the ability to livestream or be used as a webcam, as well as some neat tricks like a color temperature sensor that DJI says will help produce better colors in complicated lighting situations or underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilyFmF"&gt;Comparing the Action 2’s price with GoPro’s isn’t straightforward, due to GoPro’s pricing model and the DJI’s modularity. You can get the Hero10 for $400, but that requires having a $50-a-year subscription — otherwise, the camera is $500. The Action 2 power bundle costs $399 and includes the camera, power module (which extends your record time to 180 minutes versus the camera’s 70 and adds an extra microSD card slot), a mount, and a lanyard. DJI tells me you can’t buy the camera by itself, which seems like a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjFKBN"&gt;If you want to replicate the Hero10’s built-in front-facing screen, you’ll have to go for the $519 dual-screen bundle, which includes the same things as the power bundle (but swaps out the battery module with the screen one) and adds a ball-joint adapter as well. While that’s technically more than the GoPro’s non-subscriber asking price, the Hero10’s lack of built-in storage means that you’d probably make up the price difference buying a microSD card anyways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FH7JUD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="DJI Action Cam 2|104515" data-volume-uuid="77a6c6aa5" data-volume-id="104515" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-616" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ZquG"&gt;DJI says that the dual-screen bundle will be coming on November 2nd, and the power combo, along with most other accessories, will be coming in “mid-November.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is my Alexa flashing green, red, orange, and yellow?  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Wr_Bs7JZBoIDYkC8N8yzcnu-KA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051319/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your Echo speaker is flashing, Alexa is either listening or trying to tell you something.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IBNLLC"&gt;You’ve got one of Amazon’s Echo smart speakers set up and it’s super handy for playing music, checking the weather, setting an egg timer — all hands-free. But then it starts flashing different colors at random times: red, green, yellow, orange... it’s almost like it’s trying to communicate with you. Which, in fact, it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQbVIZ"&gt;When your Echo speaker is flashing its LED at you, there is a really easy way to figure out what it wants. Just say, “Alexa, what does your light mean?” But that would be a really short blog. So, for those of us who don’t like talking to our smart speakers, I’ve made this quick cheat sheet to explain what all those flashing lights mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JQtIY"&gt;The LED light is Alexa’s status and notification indicator. Depending on which device you have, the LED light will be in a different location. For example, on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;new Echo&lt;/a&gt; and Echo Dot, it’s a ring at the bottom; on the Echo Studio, it’s a ring up top; and on the Echo Show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"&gt;smart displays&lt;/a&gt;, it appears as a line on the bottom of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZxsu8"&gt;Wherever it’s situated, most of the time it’s hanging out doing nothing. But when you see it pulsing, circling, or swirling, Alexa is either listening to you or trying to tell you something. Here’s what it wants you to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nteD6p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing yellow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MEBJfP"&gt;A slow yellow “burst” every few seconds means your Alexa voice assistant has something to tell you. Ask, “Alexa, what are my notifications? Or “Alexa, what are my messages?” and all will be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHdmng"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing blue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wkBMKJ"&gt;A cyan spotlight on a blue ring means Alexa heard you — the cyan spotlight will actually point in the direction it heard your voice. It will then spin as it processes your request. If it’s spinning while you’re not talking to it, it means the device is starting up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vox4qKFfg95XIGT4cIJqbQl0ufo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989899/dseifert_201025_4263_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A cyan blue point on a blue light ring shows that the Echo smart speaker is listening.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6DFHeT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing red&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZhNHc"&gt;If the ring is solid red, it means the speaker’s microphone is muted and can’t hear you. Hit the unmute button to open up those mics again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WL0zFQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing orange&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JRDVn9"&gt;A swirling orange light means the Echo speaker is in setup mode or is trying to connect to the internet. An orange line on a smart display like an Echo Show means it’s trying to connect to the internet but is currently offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MkYzPP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nkt8he"&gt;Pulsing green on an Echo tells you someone is calling you. It should be accompanied by an announcement of who is calling. Say “Alexa, answer” to connect to the call (assuming you want to answer it). While on the call, the green light starts spinning until the call ends. A spinning green light will also appear if you are in a “Drop-In” with another speaker on your network.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JmTtMVEQ180G8pHq0-CKbBwUEMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641649/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED light bar on the Echo Show smart displays will appear at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CpSFa2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing purple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tTQs8w"&gt;A purple ring or line means you’ve got Do Not Disturb enabled on the speaker. This blocks notifications, calls, and messages, but not alarms, timers, or reminders. It will flash purple when you ask it to do something. You can ask Alexa to turn Do Not Disturb off or do it manually in the Alexa app. If it goes purple while you are setting up the device, it couldn’t connect to Wi-Fi during setup (as opposed to &lt;em&gt;trying&lt;/em&gt; to connect, which is represented by orange).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DSwnat"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alexa is flashing white&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WTirRF"&gt;A white light moving up or down (or around) indicates you’re adjusting the volume either on the device or in the app. A spinning white light means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18622968/alexa-guard-amazon-echo-security-how-to-get"&gt;Alexa Guard&lt;/a&gt; is turned on and set in Away Mode. You can go to the app and change it to Home Mode or say, “Alexa, I’m home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Lsyc5G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to stop Alexa from flashing (as much)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0AieF1"&gt;If the constant flashing is bothering you (which is quite likely if you’re using the device as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727055/alexa-google-smart-speaker-alarm-clocks-backup-battery"&gt;smart alarm clock by your bed&lt;/a&gt;), you can turn off all but essential notifications: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5hbd1m"&gt;Go to the Alexa app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wqhwB2"&gt;Tap on More &amp;gt; Settings &amp;gt; Device Settings &amp;gt; [your speaker name] &amp;gt; Communications &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KI9CR2"&gt;Toggle Communications off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0HFmZE"&gt;This will only stop the yellow and green rings from flashing — which are also the most likely to flash. But it will also disable Drop In and Announcements (where you can speak to one Echo in your house and every other one will relay the message), and it will still flash if there’s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft ramps up plans to make its data centers less thirsty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boiling liquid carries away heat generated by computer servers at a Microsoft datacenter. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PohV-1JZgasKHf2ZBpjA9Go9mas=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051260/datacenter_liquid_cooling_server_blade_immersion_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Boiling liquid carries away heat generated by computer servers at a Microsoft datacenter.  | Image: Gene Twedt for Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zh84m8"&gt;Microsoft ramped up its commitments today to conserve water and energy in its data centers, laying out new cooling tech and strategies that could push &lt;a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/abfba1"&gt;notoriously thirsty and energy hungry&lt;/a&gt; servers past their current limits. The company’s latest environmental pledge comes as it plans to dramatically expand the number of data centers it operates around the world, a move that could put more stress on drought-stricken communities unless the company finds ways to use less water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VddZip"&gt;Microsoft plans to slash the amount of water its data centers use by 95 percent by 2024, with the goal of “eventually” eliminating water use. That builds on a commitment it made last year to become “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448896/microsoft-environmental-pledge-water-scarcity-data-centers"&gt;water positive&lt;/a&gt;” by the end of the decade, meaning it would replenish more water than it uses for its operations. In 2020, Microsoft also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;committed to becoming carbon negative&lt;/a&gt; by the same deadline, meaning it plans to draw down and store more planet-heating CO2 than it releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="oLTB5U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plans to dramatically expand the number of data centers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJ7Z99"&gt;Microsoft also announced other &lt;a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/industry-blog/uncategorized/2021/10/14/5-reasons-to-attend-the-digital-event-whats-next-for-sustainability/"&gt;sustainability efforts&lt;/a&gt; today that could lower greenhouse gas emissions inside and outside the company. It’s looking for building materials for its data centers that are less carbon-intensive, including research into bricks made with algae and structural tubes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22257120/mushroom-bricks-mycelium-sustainable-building-materials"&gt;made with mushrooms&lt;/a&gt;. It also previewed a new tool called Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, which can help organizations track their carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDmYTs"&gt;But the big commitment involves the data centers. Data centers like Microsoft’s are packed with servers which enable people to store files, send messages, and shop and game online. All of that activity uses up a lot of energy and generates heat. Overheating can affect servers’ performance and reliability, but blasting them with air conditioning drives up electricity use and greenhouse gas emissions. It’s possible to use water to cool down servers, but water has become an increasingly scarce resource in many of the arid places where data centers operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaBuw7"&gt;A typical data center uses about as much water as a city with a population of about 30,000 to 40,000 people, or about 3 to 5 million gallons of water a day, says Venkatesh Uddameri, professor and director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University. Microsoft tells&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its data centers use less water than that, although it varies across different regions and climates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PWWwz"&gt;Microsoft’s data centers currently use adiabatic cooling, which relies on outside air to cool down temperatures inside. It’s a system that uses less electricity than air conditioning and less water than cooling towers. But when temperatures rise above 85 degrees Celsius, outside air isn’t very helpful. At that point, an evaporative cooling system kicks in, which uses water. It works like a “swamp cooler” — cooling the air by pushing it over or through water-soaked screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJJoHN"&gt;Microsoft today revealed two main strategies it plans to lean on to meet its water conservation goals. First: it researched how its servers perform under higher temperatures, and found that it can set higher limits for when the centers’ evaporative cooling systems kick in. In cooler parts of the world — including Amsterdam, Dublin, Virginia, and Chicago — those higher set points could, over the next few years, get rid of the need for water completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j492pC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data centers in desert regions, where water scarcity is a bigger problem, will likely continue to guzzle water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVJ1LW"&gt;But Microsoft’s data centers in desert regions, where water scarcity is a bigger problem, will likely continue to guzzle water for years longer. Microsoft says the same strategy that might eliminate water use in Amsterdam and Dublin would only reduce water consumption in desert regions by as much as 60 percent by 2024.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3cjUJ"&gt;That’s where the second part of Microsoft’s plan comes in. To get its water footprint down to zero in those hot and dry climates, Microsoft plans to turn to a new way to cool servers: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22369609/microsoft-server-cooling-liquid-immersion-cloud-racks-data-centers"&gt;submerging them in fluorocarbon-based liquid baths&lt;/a&gt;. As the servers work away, the heat they generate causes the liquid to boil when it reaches 122 degrees Fahrenheit (50 degrees Celsius). The boiling liquid moves heat away from the servers and then turns into a vapor that rises. The vapor hits a cooled tank lid, condenses, and rains back into the tub. The process, called two-phase liquid immersion, creates a closed-loop cooling system that cuts down on water and electricity use while getting rid of heat. It’s a strategy that the company says was inspired by cryptocurrency miners, who also use huge amounts of energy and have turned to liquid immersion cooling for computing equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPKglo"&gt;While experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke to say the technology is promising, they say getting it to work at scale will be another challenge. Microsoft just announced its first trial run with immersion cooling in April and says this technology is still in the research and development stage. Very few data centers — probably fewer than 2 percent — rely on immersion cooling, according to Lucas Beran, principal analyst at the market research firm Dell’Oro Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iSWgLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A massive operation switch”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0QBsSl"&gt;“You also think about the scale of someone like Microsoft deploying the amount of data centers that they are building and the amount of compute they’re deploying — that’s a massive supply chain switch. That’s a massive operation switch,” Beran says. Microsoft will have to study and plan for how that change will affect data center performance and train staff to work in new environments, he points out. “It’s a very large undertaking, but one that has some extremely positive potential outcomes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knk6g6"&gt;Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will take a phased approach to rolling out its new cooling strategies for data centers. Immersion cooling will require new, specially designed servers, and Microsoft will wait for its server configurations to age out before replacing them in existing data centers. Even the plethora of new data centers the company has planned will likely first be built with hybrid cooling systems as it transitions to new immersion technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDOQYG"&gt;Microsoft plans to build 50 to 100 new data centers a year to keep up with demand for its cloud services. Global internet traffic is expected to double by next year, it says. That’s a huge opportunity for the company, but also a big challenge to the company’s new sustainability goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HXhxTB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pay special attention to places under more water stress&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1BCYI"&gt;Tensions have risen, for example, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/drought-stricken-communities-push-back-against-data-centers-n1271344"&gt;around data centers in Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, where Microsoft opened up a new one this year. After federal authorities declared the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22627681/water-shortage-lake-mead-hoover-dam-colorado-river"&gt;water shortage&lt;/a&gt; on the Colorado River in August, Arizona faces imminent cuts to its water supply. The cuts, so far, will primarily limit water for agriculture, but some residents are worried that new data centers in the region will only intensify competition for already scarce water resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRFvbN"&gt;The company will need to address issues unique to each location where it builds a data center and pay special attention to places under more water stress. “There is no one-size-fits all type of solution,” says Uddameri. “You can become water positive as a company, but it’s not useful if you save all the water in one location, as an extreme case, and you create bigger deficits elsewhere.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon updates Echo Frames to make it easier to send texts and make calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_aVcjm42wjRUbtZWChmyn24uXgM=/0x1:1997x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051348/Modern_Tortoise__Sunglasses.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The existing tortoiseshell color is also getting new lens options, like sunglass.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0OYKtN"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Frames, the Alexa-enabled eyeglasses equipped with tiny speakers and microphones, are getting updated with new quality-of-life features like the ability to automatically wake up from power-saving sleep mode when you put them on your face, and a shortcut to quickly phone a contact of your choosing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXytVt"&gt;The new features are rolling out on November 10th, the same day Amazon is releasing new gray and blue colors of the Echo Frames for $249.99 which. Along with the existing tortoiseshell frames, these new colors will be available with new lens options for polarized sunglass and blue-light filters for $269.99. These lens options &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441187/amazon-echo-frames-sunglasses-blue-light-filter"&gt;launched earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but until now they’ve only been available with the black frame option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mSKzFK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hands-free SMS messaging is coming to iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxtgn0"&gt;Other new features include the ability to call a priority contact with a simple long-press of the Echo Frames’ touchpad and the ability to change the Frames’ wake word from “Alexa” to “Echo.” The glasses’ automatic volume feature is also being updated so that it adjusts throughout a listening session to overcome loud ambient noise, rather than just at the start. The glasses already automatically enter sleep mode when you turn them upside down, but now it’ll be easier to wake them up by simply putting them on your face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISZMnk"&gt;Finally, the hands-free text messaging feature that’s already available on Android is expanding to iOS “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2v1mK"&gt;Amazon says the new features are coming to both new and existing Frames owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="81y0iI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction October 27th, 9:33AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article originally misstated that the ability to turn the glasses upside down to put them into sleep mode is a new feature. This is incorrect. Instead, the new feature is that they will automatically wake up when you put them on your face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy is a damn good superhero video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sYllc1MDjdkSRn5cWnOF9Xdpoig=/239x0:3479x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051176/FCp5Ql3X0AgqKru.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A tracklist of ’80s mega-hits isn’t the only thing Guardians has going for it&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="CHMfgp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22519348/guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-square-enix-eidos-montreal-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687700/guardians-of-the-galaxy-square-enix-action-rpg-preview"&gt;surprised the hell outta me&lt;/a&gt;. I expected standard, blockbuster action-RPG fare painted with an ’80s nostalgic gloss that would never elicit an emotion more meaningful than, “cool, they got the rights to Blondie!” And while the developers at Eidos Montreal did indeed get the rights to Blondie and an impressive host of other ’80s mainstays, I was shocked to discover a game that had so much heart and emotional depth that on several occasions, I caught myself whispering a reverent “damn” at the screen. Though combat can be a bit of a slog, every Guardian and just about every non-Guardian are so well written and voiced, you don’t mind toughing it out to get at the juicy character development bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFVvM1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; has absolutely nothing to do with the Marvel cinematic universe and just barely kisses comic continuity, though some of the characters’ backstory introduced in the movies still applies. Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, is still a man plucked from Earth in the ’80s to live a ne’er do well life in space before cleaning up his act. Gamora is the face-turned adopted daughter of Thanos. Drax is a widowed warrior from the planet Katath who is incapable of understanding sarcasm. Rocket is a space experiment gone wrong or right depending on perspective, and Groot is still the tri-syllabic tree creature whom only Rocket understands.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9tGsmfOSLbZjSMsSVz6QcjHVJPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957816/MGG_2021_06_14_scr_02.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FG0zPS"&gt;We catch up with the Guardians 12 years after the end of an intergalactic war that saw Thanos and the ruthless Chitauri empire defeated. You play as Peter Quill, pilot of the spaceship Milano and leader of the newfound Guardians of the Galaxy — a mercenary group that will do literally anything for money. Peter’s friends and colleagues are prickly, egotistical people who are still getting to know each other, and it’s your job to keep them in line as best you can as you bumble your way through ruining and then saving the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrGWgu"&gt;The characters in this game are amazing, and I love every one of them, even the ones I didn’t really care for in the movies. To avoid infringing on actors’ likenesses, all the characters look like Wal-Mart brand versions of their movie counterparts. It was off-putting at first, but I came to prefer the uncanny valley Guardian look-alikes. Drax the Destroyer never moved my needle, if you know what I mean. Dave Bautista is a good-looking guy, but I just wasn’t attracted to his Drax. And though game-Drax has the same incredibly dry personality and (mostly) the same look as movie-Drax, there’s a tenderness to him that we just didn’t see in the movies. His extreme aggression and violence are just a smokescreen hiding a man still quietly mourning the murder of his wife and child by Thanos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3glr3"&gt;Early in the game, you frequently have to defend Gamora (his family’s murderer’s daughter) against him, correcting him when he calls her “assassin” instead of her name. By the end of the game, when all the Guardians have broken down their toughest, prickliest bits, Drax starts calling Gamora by her name all on his own, and he says one of the sweetest lines I’ve ever heard in a video game — saying that if they die on their quest, he’ll ask his god if there’s room for his friends in his heaven. Naturally, I fell instantly in love. It also doesn’t hurt that Drax is a physically competent himbo who is always moving or chucking heavy objects while shirtless. Let’s just say Drax could destroy me at any time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgQFKjYp6AqnLfZsTH8cHLhxFbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957830/FCp60zEXoAMv8Vx.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Square Enix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRyPtO"&gt;Rocket Raccoon was another surprise for me. Early in the game, you have the option to throw Rocket like a football across a chasm so he can hack a panel that will create a bridge the party can use to get across. Rocket, naturally, objects to this treatment. If you choose the throw option (like I did), Rocket is furious — not because of the bodily harm, but because you violated his autonomy. Rocket Raccoon is a Looney Toon; he’s a foul-mouthed raccoon that makes things explode. Ha, ha, very funny. It’s easy to dismiss him as a joke — which is exactly how he’s treated in the movie — and it would have been very easy, expected even, for the game to continue to lean into that characterization without examining how Rocket feels about it. Though he has the appearance of a tiny, garbage-eating woodland creature, game-Rocket refuses to let people treat him as less than human. The moment is a really good example of the game’s choice / consequence system because when you throw him, Rocket won’t let you forget it, and he makes you feel like a piece of shit, which, if you do throw him, you kinda are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6jyg5"&gt;Choice in this game is really well done. The game treats your decisions with enough weight to make them feel like they matter while also throwing in cool change-ups in choice presentation. Like most games with a choice mechanic, options are presented as a dialogue box on a timer. The game pauses, and you have so many seconds to make your choice before action resumes with a little “Character will remember that” box ala the Telltale games of yore. Late in the game, in the middle of combat, Gamora says she’s going to chase after the escaping bad guy. In this situation, there was no stoppage and no dialogue box; therefore, I didn’t know there was a choice to be made at the time. The battle arena was set up such that you can follow after Gamora, or you can continue the fight with Rocket, Groot, and Drax. Wanting to back up my friend, I chased after her. The platform I was running on exploded, throwing me into what would have been a fall to my death, but Gamora rushed in to save me, thus denying her the chase. Then a box popped, “Gamora is furious you didn’t let her chase the bad guy.” I was stunned, unaware I was making a decision there, impressed with the way Eidos Montreal switched up how choice was presented, changing it from the expected piece of text you select like picking off a list to something you make your character do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1CiG5Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When you throw him, Rocket won’t let you forget it, and he makes you feel like a piece of shit, which, if you do throw him, you kinda are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ppk0l"&gt;The characters are alive in &lt;em&gt;Guardians,&lt;/em&gt; and it makes them the game’s biggest appeal. They react to what you do and the choices you make. Gamora frequently brought up me not trusting her to go after the bad guy alone, and if you wander off to explore some hidden nook or cranny looking for one of the game’s many collectibles, they call you out on it, chiding you for wasting time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zB3To"&gt;Combat is the least enjoyable part of the game, but it isn’t too big of a deal-breaker. As Peter, you’re equipped with pistols that shoot elemental bullets, and you can also command your Guardians, having them execute one of three standard abilities or a special super-move. Once you’ve mastered the stagger system, elemental properties, and issuing commands, combat becomes a rote experience to largely endure rather than enjoy. There’s just enough variety in enemy weaknesses, environmental hazards, and abilities that stringing together successful combos isn’t terribly repetitive, but combat just isn’t where this game shines. Enemies aren’t difficult, they’re time-consuming, and when the game chains battle sections back to back that are filled with the biggest, beefiest monster types, it gets to be a slog. There’s a particularly unforgivable sequence toward the end that was a never-ending corridor of battle arenas with no platforming sections interspersed to break up the action. It was the most tedious part of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUh1ffglllqXGGFbVZbeAnzhbmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957840/combat.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4FA6tM"&gt;I also did not love the controls. It was too easy to get my wires crossed, triggering a huddle when I meant to direct Rocket to throw a grenade. Huddles are an ultimate ability that buffs either you or all of your party, depending on the dialogue choice you make. They started out as a cute, little treat but quickly became very stale. In a game that is extremely good with how characters respond to events in their context, huddles are a strange aberration. The Guardian’s comments are never appropriate to the battle, and if you trigger one during a boss fight, they don’t even mention who you’re fighting. Huddles are also an unexpected source of hilarity. In addition to providing a buff and a heal for party members, a huddle will also play a song from the aforementioned ’80s hit list totally at random. I don’t know about you, but when I think of an ’80s, hotblooded, pick-me-up song, I’m not thinking of “Bad Reputation;” I’m thinking of “Wake Me Up Before you Go-Go.” The game agreed... &lt;em&gt;frequently&lt;/em&gt;. In my entire playthrough, I never once got Bonnie Tyler’s “Holding Out For A Hero” after a huddle, even though that song was played during every one of the game’s promotional videos. I held out for a hero, and nobody came.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ1MEY"&gt;Like many, I enjoyed the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; movie duology more than I thought I would. It’s the same for &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;. It would have been easy to stretch the skin of a typical superhero movie plot over the bones of a standard action game and call it a day — kinda like most of &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Avengers.&lt;/em&gt; But &lt;em&gt;Guardians&lt;/em&gt; defied being a lifeless, flesh hulk to instead be a living, breathing creature with a heart that beats and bleeds all over the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRzDer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung is bringing its One UI design to its Windows laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Q8PGWmzdgxKqy-QpsOz82DPxls=/227x0:2653x1617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051028/990Suet.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MK5qA8"&gt;Samsung is bringing its One UI 4 mobile interface design to its Galaxy Book series of Windows laptops. The new design changes will appear inside Samsung’s Windows apps like Samsung Notes, Samsung Gallery, and Samsung Settings. The changes are designed to match the mobile interface that Samsung’s bringing to its latest Android phones, to make it easier to switch between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqXsI4"&gt;The main Samsung Settings app has been overhauled to better fit the design changes in Windows 11, with new app icons, menu layouts, and more. Samsung’s Notes app also has a new menu layout, updated icons, and refreshed folders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RX_WwIo1JFbNJ0QCcF7GuI9oiQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959055/990Suet.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new One UI 4 changes in Samsung’s Notes app for Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zelXuwg1t4OK_jJ2UtSWH6HE4HA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959058/PILWMcw.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Gallery includes a dark mode on Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="udsdVS"&gt;The Samsung Gallery app is the final app that has been updated with One UI 4 changes, and it includes a dark mode to match Windows 11’s themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dmr25"&gt;While Microsoft has also overhauled its design language with Windows 11, Samsung’s changes here bring a more mobile-like UI to its Windows apps. Samsung is calling this One UI Book 4, and it will be available on the Galaxy Book Pro 360, Galaxy Book Pro, Galaxy Book Flex2, Galaxy Book, and Galaxy Book Odyssey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jA3Qz2"&gt;Samsung’s design effort on Windows comes after years of a close partnership between Microsoft and Samsung. The pair originally partnered to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20756647/microsoft-samsung-android-apps-partnership-galaxy-note-10-unpacked-event"&gt;bring Android and Windows closer together&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in a lot of exclusive Your Phone integration for Samsung devices. Samsung has also integrated OneDrive support into its mobile apps, and Microsoft has optimized its own Office apps for Samsung’s Galaxy Fold devices. Microsoft and Samsung also have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354079/microsoft-samsung-xbox-game-pass-partnership-android-galaxy-note-20"&gt;special partnership for Xbox Game Pass on Android&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
