    <title>Paramount Plus is a powerful nostalgia machine, but it doesn’t feel necessary yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tU_vW-Gmn0wM-l7dSIy2dfqxIi8=/191x0:2084x1262/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918278/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.28.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLkF2l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/984581/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNostalgia030521%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; is maybe one of the best streaming services for people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s who are looking to get nostalgic about the television of their youth. Outside of that, Paramount Plus is a bit of a head-scratcher. There certainly seems to be a bunch to choose from, but with missing seasons, incomplete film collections, and no immediate “must watch” TV or movie options, the question is still why would anyone sign up for this right now? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNYdyB"&gt;The good thing is that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300993/paramount-plus-streaming-wars-netflix-disney-launch-date-price"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;’ positives are hard to deny, but most of those positives fall on the TV side. As someone in their late 20s who grew up on a hearty breakfast of Nickelodeon shows, MTV reality series, and crime procedurals, Paramount Plus has everything I would have wanted a decade ago. Last night, I watched a bit of &lt;em&gt;All That&lt;/em&gt; before starting up &lt;em&gt;Jersey Shore &lt;/em&gt;again and ended the night with some &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;. A total blast! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IvFj6DuFheQc42ew2Zmi4Vb81Qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348220/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.15.06_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="enmLBU"&gt;Whereas CBS All Access was restrained in its offerings, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; takes full advantage of Viacom’s library. Instead of having to choose from a medley of cop shows, classic television, films people may have forgotten about, and various&lt;em&gt; Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; installments, there are classic BET and MTV shows, Comedy Central specials, and Nickelodeon collections on top of what CBS All Access already offered (like next-day episodes). Paramount Plus is peak snackable TV, comfort shows that can be tossed on before bed, in the background, or when the nostalgic urge returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQEl7v"&gt;While Paramount Plus’ library is what stands out, there are issues. Full seasons of shows and installments in film franchises are missing. &lt;em&gt;Rocket Power &lt;/em&gt;only has one season available, &lt;em&gt;CSI &lt;/em&gt;made the first, second, and 15th seasons available, &lt;em&gt;FBI &lt;/em&gt;only has the third season, and several seasons of &lt;em&gt;All That &lt;/em&gt;are gone. On the film side, sequels to movies like &lt;em&gt;Grease, Bad News Bears, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Charlie’s Angels &lt;/em&gt;are available but not the first movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08CwuC"&gt;I would imagine this comes down to rights agreements (remember, ViacomCBS shows are also on Netflix, Peacock, and Hulu), but it’s something that came up for me a few times to the point it was noticeable for all the wrong reasons. Understandably, it’s a bit of a pain. But there are full seasons of shows like &lt;em&gt;Drake &amp;amp; Josh, Survivor, Criminal Minds, Cheers, Frasier, &lt;/em&gt;various &lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;seasons, and hundreds of other movies to watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j61hFy"&gt;Content-wise, Paramount Plus’ biggest flaw is a staggering lack of exciting original series — even the selection of originals is several rows down on the homepage. Considering so many of these series are on other streamers — I can watch &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;iCarly &lt;/em&gt;either on Paramount Plus or Netflix — it’s hard to think of anyone beyond nostalgic 20- and 30-somethings signing up to scratch an itch. And even then, how many people are rushing to rewatch &lt;em&gt;Rugrats&lt;/em&gt; when they’re still making their way through a back catalog on Netflix?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cy8Idf"&gt;(For what it’s worth, it seems like ViacomCBS is aware of this, too, moving &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/a-quiet-place-2-release-date-moves-up-to-may-1234922520/"&gt;release date up to May&lt;/a&gt;. This means it will debut on Paramount Plus much earlier than anticipated and hopefully bring in a batch of new subscribers.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M69H1OnRD6IlCSkJBsOCpJ2zm2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348224/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.17.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="32BFaJ"&gt;The answer may lie in Paramount Plus’ live offerings. There are four specific live channels with the Premium ($9.99-a-month) plan: CBS local news, CBS News network (24/7), CBS Sports HQ, and ET Live. Since these are pulling feeds from live TV broadcasts, they include ads. I didn’t particularly care about using CBS Local News, CBS News, or ET Live since I can grab the majority of my news from reporters on Twitter, but Sports HQ is interesting. There isn’t any control over what game or sport you’re watching, but I found myself checking back in from time to time to see if it was anything interesting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgDT1m"&gt;The main problem is that it’s not a strong enough offering for sports fans who want access to every game (this is also the group of consumers who tend to hold onto their cable packages longest), and the news offering is relatively weak, too. If the idea is for a group of consumers to use Paramount Plus’ live channels as a replacement of sorts for cable — and I’m not sure that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; the idea — it’s simply not enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BS8wIk"&gt;That’s content. But what about the actual platform itself? Like every streaming service, there are pros and cons, but I found the pros greatly outweighed the cons. Like HBO Max and Disney Plus, ViacomCBS makes it so people can browse via preferred network: BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, CBS, Comedy Central, and the Smithsonian Channel. This is key for someone like me who is primarily using Paramount Plus for Nickelodeon and MTV shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfq1oz"&gt;Search tools are pretty accurate, and the subheadings within film and TV sections are plentiful. Switching from one episode to another while watching a show is pretty easy (simply scroll down and pick a new episode), and controls for rewinding or fast-forwarding are effortless. There are plenty of options for caption customization, including font, size, and background color. While a launch wouldn’t be a launch without some cons, the only big one I discovered was not being able to add a show or film to a watch list like Netflix allows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZcSeneN1ptyJVkxH2pX7q42xXwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348230/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_12.19.00_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l13rOv"&gt;All in all, &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/984581/3065?subId1=VergeParamountPlusNostalgia030521%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2F"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty decent streaming service for $10 a month. When I feel the desire to rewatch &lt;em&gt;The Hills &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Jimmy Neutron, &lt;/em&gt;I’m sure I’ll return to it. But in a world where it’s so easy to cancel and sign back up for a service, I don’t see any real reason to keep Paramount Plus now when Netflix, Disney Plus, HBO Max, and Hulu fulfill so much of the same needs, but with new shows and films that I actively want to use the streaming services for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYOhR4"&gt;Maybe things will change when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7, A Quiet Place Part II, &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series become available to stream. For now, it’s a giant nostalgia machine that I’m glad exists, but I don’t feel like I need to add it to my monthly bill cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sNM88"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jay Peters? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nzjJVtEToH8cmyxn7XEX72FBRBk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918189/jpeters_210301_4457_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How he adjusts the workspace to his needs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Wc3oae"&gt;The Verge lives on news, and Jay Peters is one of the news writers who keeps it going — searching out the latest info about what’s going on in technology, entertainment, and culture, and writing it up for the site. As with the rest of us, Jay has been doing most of his work from home over the last year — here’s how he manages it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMtXYq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1wng0"&gt;I’m a news writer here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m fortunate to get to cover all sorts of things in tech, gaming, entertainment, and more. On any given day, I might write about things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22298495/pokemon-hardware-gadgets-pikachu-poke-ball-mini-camera-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299339/spider-man-movie-title-no-way-home-tom-holland"&gt;Marvel movie titles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/11/25/20982612/monopoly-longest-game-ever-edition-hasbro-trolling"&gt;Monopoly Longest Game Ever edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lw0e3Y"&gt;I had a bit of a roundabout path to this job. Out of college, I worked in technology PR, got my start writing about tech at &lt;a href="https://techmeme.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Techmeme&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in August 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8It11H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq831Q"&gt;Getting the setup to where it is now has taken years. I’ve experimented with different desks, mice, keyboards, laptop stands, monitor arms, and even at one point attached the Nintendo Switch dock to one of the legs of the desk using velcro. And I’m always tinkering with my setup, so anything I have set up now could change down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H20O2r"&gt;As for &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt; the desk is, it was a happy coincidence that my current apartment has a corner that’s the perfect size for this desk and the dresser (which holds things like game controllers and my notebook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlVoCN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What adjustments have you had to make for working at home and how do you deal with distractions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LaKJz"&gt;My wife and I have been working from home since 2017, so our physical work environments haven’t changed much due to the pandemic. Because we live in a studio, though, we have to communicate every day about our schedules and meetings so that we can avoid both being on the phone at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIIsTH"&gt;To keep out distractions, I usually just put in my AirPods Pro, without sound. That’s often enough to block things so I can stay focused. But if I need a little white noise, I turn on this extended YouTube video consisting entirely of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ZPoqNeR3_UA"&gt;ambient engine noise from the USS Enterprise from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been my go-to for years. And when I feel like working to some music, I have been turning to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0nBYI0owpeY"&gt;lo-fi remixes of video game music&lt;/a&gt; as of late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D4SDwZOUp3rACZ2kxJAEFgZvDRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347061/jpeters_210226_4457_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWcnWHktfRy_NtgLYHnVYywfnOc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347074/jpeters_210226_4457_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jLjAkC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself, which I see is a sitting / standing desk. How did you choose it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ4z71"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fully Jarvis standing desk&lt;/a&gt;. I used a sitting / standing desk at my PR job and got used to being able to switch back and forth, and standing makes me feel less lazy about being parked in front of a computer all day. I also find switching between sitting and standing relieves back pain and helps with a repetitive strain injury (RSI) in my wrists that first flared up a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmnzy"&gt;One of the best add-ons I got for the desk was the programmable memory unit, which lets me tap a button to adjust the desk to my preferred sitting and standing positions. I also got the casters (wheels) so that I could wheel it over to my and my wife’s lounge chairs, which are right behind the desk. I can bring the desk over, adjust the monitor a bit lower, and then use it to watch movies and play video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gke2wF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you have less desktop space than most of the desks we’ve seen from your colleagues. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esZcpp"&gt;Space is at a premium in my studio, so a smaller desk works better for me right now. I’m also fortunate that I can technically do my entire job with just a laptop, so I don’t &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; a bigger desk — though a keyboard, mouse, and monitor make it much easier! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8KMi0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting-looking desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="278I3C"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44880&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fchairs%2Fhag-capisco-chair.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Capisco Chair by HÅG&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought so, too, when I first saw it on Fully’s online store. I had no plans to buy it because of the price, which starts at $829. But I tried it out at the Fully showroom in Portland and it was my favorite chair there, so I sprung for it. Every single day, I’m glad that I did, since I can comfortably sit in it for hours and it helps a lot with my posture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="wsCwXH"&gt;
&lt;div id="V6qQSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371531" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bh3IJJ"&gt;
&lt;p id="3IWtjE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KobMOI"&gt;I’ve got a new 13-inch MacBook Air with Apple’s custom M1 chip inside. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;It’s a fantastic machine&lt;/a&gt;. The only upgrade I added was 16GB of RAM. I didn’t add any onboard storage because the majority of my digital life is stored online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fK68T"&gt;The monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BZNDOO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VS228H-P with a 21.5-inch screen&lt;/a&gt;. My Amazon account tells me I bought this all the way back in 2015, but even though it’s old, I remain very happy with it. (I will admit that I thought this was a 24-inch screen for, uh, years.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCykmp"&gt;It’s attached to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078455485/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monitor mount from Huanuo&lt;/a&gt;, and I bought it because it was the tallest one I could find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7wSxQD"&gt;
&lt;div id="7l3USa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10349083" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NXzpJY"&gt;
&lt;p id="gP5TLb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really interesting display setup. How did you decide on it? Does it work well for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5p4S1R"&gt;I use a single monitor because I get distracted too easily if I have more than one. I’d like to upgrade to something bigger or maybe even an ultrawide someday, though (especially now that I know I have a 21.5-inch monitor instead of a 24-inch one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSqIBS"&gt;The extremely tall monitor mount serves two purposes: it helps a lot with my posture and is highly adjustable, which means I can bring it to a lower height when I’m sitting in the chairs behind the desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3SYS2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us a little about the mouse you have to the right of your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mIPfn"&gt;It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.contourdesign.com/product/unimouse/"&gt;Contour Unimouse&lt;/a&gt;. My wrists can hurt if I use a “flat” mouse for two long, so I spent a lot of time and money trying out different vertical mice to see which one was the best fit for me. I like the Unimouse a lot because of just how high it angles — the company’s website says it’s 70 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9tpAe"&gt;The mouse pad is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072C93TQL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VictSing Ergonomic Mouse Pad&lt;/a&gt;. I don’t remember why I picked it over others, but it works great for me and it’s cheap.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzULIS40j4oD8nJMgiRVlV0Gpj0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347068/jpeters_210226_4457_0010.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nT4SIW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re the second person I’ve seen who uses a split keyboard. Do you find it better than a traditional keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67oxdT"&gt;I do! It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Freestyle-Ergonomic-Mechanical-Programmable-Adjustable/dp/B07CX9KQRQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kinesis Freestyle Pro&lt;/a&gt; with the additional tenting accessories and wrist pads. I happily used the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sculpt-ergonomic-desktop%2F8xk02kz6k69w%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Sculpt ergonomic keyboard&lt;/a&gt; for years, and also tried other ergonomic keyboards like the &lt;a href="https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2-dvorak/"&gt;Kinesis Advantage2 QD&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ergodox-ez.com/"&gt;ErgoDox EZ&lt;/a&gt;. But the Freestyle Pro just feels the best to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMMkwP"&gt;I also like that I can program specific keys to macros. On the left side of my keyboard, you can see that I have crudely taped scraps of Post-It notes over some of the keys — those scraps are reminders of what I have programmed the keys to do, like Command + L to quickly highlight the link in the URL bar of my browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LRvHCG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g4whKL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371799" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eB4Ssr"&gt;
&lt;p id="oZcvCf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2F70e"&gt;During the workday, my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; hardly ever leave my ears — they’re comfortable, sound fine, and work really well with my Mac and iPhone. I have just one criticism: unlike the original AirPods, the AirPods Pro tend to fall out when I’m talking on calls or eating. Hopefully Apple tweaks the fit of the AirPods Pro a little for the next model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTe2pE"&gt;My webcam is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C920-Pro-Webcam-Black/dp/B00829D0GM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 HD Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s great and much better than my MacBook Air’s webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgaftI"&gt;My &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9JXWTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub is the Totu 13-in-1&lt;/a&gt;. It’s honestly overkill for my needs, but it works fine. Sometimes, though, it emits a dog whistle-pitched squeal that is really annoying. And the charging pad is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CHOETECH-Wireless-Charging-Compatible-Included/dp/B07THTPJFS/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=chotech&amp;amp;qid=1614707259&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Choetech charging pad&lt;/a&gt;. It works well enough, though it charges my iPhone very slowly and sometimes requires me to shift my devices around a bit until their charging indicators turn on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qu4nTB"&gt;To the left of my desk are my &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/consoles/console/playstation5-digital-edition-console.3005817"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeFullyStandingDesk030521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles%2Fxbox-series-x%23purchase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/system/"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;. I have mostly only owned Nintendo consoles until recently, so I’ve been spending a lot of my pandemic free time catching up on older PlayStation and Xbox games on the PS5 and Series X. (I’m currently tearing my way through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493208/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-ps4-review-vanillaware"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) They’re all sitting on an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fmalm-2-drawer-chest-white-stained-oak-veneer-10178601%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IKEA Malm two-drawer chest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZg5V1"&gt;And throughout the day, I sip water from my trusty &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hydroflask.com%2F21-oz-standard-mouth-w-sport-cap%3Fcolor%3Dblack&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22310104%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jay-peters-macbook-xbox" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hydro Flask water bottle&lt;/a&gt;. I swapped the cap for a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083F0JKA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Klean Kanteen Sport cap&lt;/a&gt;, though, which I find leaks less than Hydro Flask’s sport cap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DWMdce"&gt;
&lt;div id="S9hyEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10376102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="885Vop"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you sent in the photos, you apologized for the cat hair on some of your devices. Tell us about the cat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc1Hvu"&gt;Meet Gouda! He’s an eight-year old exotic shorthair and his tongue never goes all the way inside his mouth. But don’t be fooled by his cuteness, he’s full of trouble. He enjoys knocking small objects off counters and waking my wife and me up thirty minutes before the alarm goes off. But we love him dearly anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John McAfee charged with securities fraud for ‘pump and dump’ cryptocurrency scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CUBA-US-POLITICS-MCAFEE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/92YcU6XyRhrKxiigBkU2Burv5yM=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68918121/1154007456.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read ADALBERTO ROQUE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iv7bld"&gt;John McAfee has been charged with securities fraud over a “pump and dump” cryptocurrency scheme. Federal prosecutors &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476/gov.uscourts.nysd.555476.1.0.pdf"&gt;unsealed a case&lt;/a&gt; against McAfee and his executive advisor and bodyguard Jimmy Gale Watson Jr., &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/john-david-mcafee-and-executive-adviser-his-cryptocurrency-team-indicted-manhattan"&gt;claiming the pair&lt;/a&gt; earned nearly $2 million by urging Twitter followers to invest in cryptocurrencies like Reddcoin and Dogecoin, then selling off their own holdings as the price rose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEgwgV"&gt;“McAfee and Watson exploited a widely used social media platform and enthusiasm among investors in the emerging cryptocurrency market to make millions through lies and deception,” said US Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement. “The defendants allegedly used McAfee’s Twitter account to publish messages to hundreds of thousands of his Twitter followers touting various cryptocurrencies through false and misleading statements to conceal their true, self-interested motives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqUjka"&gt;The pair allegedly ran their scheme between December 2017 to October 2018. McAfee used his verified Twitter account, which currently has around 1 million followers, to recommend a “Coin of the Day” or “Coin of the Week.” The indictment says McAfee claimed to have no stake in these altcoins; in reality, McAfee would allegedly buy large quantities beforehand using bitcoin, then offload them again after his followers had driven up the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m92He3"&gt;McAfee and Watson are facing seven charges, each count carrying between five and 20 years in prison. The criminal charges include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit commodities and securities fraud, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csmrQI"&gt;McAfee — known for founding the eponymous antivirus company — was already arrested last year on &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/john-mcafee-indicted-tax-evasion"&gt;separate tax evasion charges&lt;/a&gt;. The Securities and Exchange Commission &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-246"&gt;sued him in October&lt;/a&gt; for fraudulently promoting initial coin offerings or ICOs. And in 2019, a &lt;a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/john-mcafee-wont-pay-25m-judgment-in-wrongful-death-case-has-ignored-all-lawsuits-for-11-years/"&gt;court ordered him&lt;/a&gt; to pay $25 million for allegedly ordering the 2012 killing of his neighbor in Belize. (McAfee has denied involvement and refused to pay the funds.) These charges add yet another layer to his alleged crimes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtW8Row74mvxUTT5LZi-PgYw8mY=/0x0:2598x1732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917890/Bitwarden_iphone_android_display_blue.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our top pick is free to use across a range of operating systems on mobile and desktop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Bitwarden&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGzOfL"&gt;Using a password manager is one of the best steps you can take to protect your security online. A good password manager makes it easy to generate unique, strong passwords, and it will then securely save them so they’re available wherever you need them, whether that’s on your phone, laptop, tablet, or desktop computer. Basically, they take 90 percent of the work out of being safe online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBbt6W"&gt;Hopefully, at this point everyone knows why it’s important to use a unique password for all of your accounts online. But the short version is that using one password everywhere means that if just one site you use gets hacked, an attacker potentially has the password that unlocks your entire online life. Breaches still matter if you use a password manager, but at that point it’s a case of resetting just one password rather than dozens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1thEs"&gt;Although different password managers have different selling points, most offer the same core set of features. They generate passwords which they securely store, and they’ll prompt you to save passwords when you use them on websites. They’ll also sync your passwords across devices and autofill them into websites and apps when required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh4HAn"&gt;There are many good password managers available that charge a monthly fee, but for this guide we’re going to be focusing on free services. All of them have paid subscription tiers, but for most, the free tier offers the essential core features of a password manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aNnmV"&gt;Our pick for the best for most people is Bitwarden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPU7Ha"&gt;The best for most people: Bitwarden&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KhFYyJhDEWLpdkTDgL_Oe3yCjxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347722/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_9.23.56_AM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GnGjqe"&gt;Bitwarden has basically everything you could want out of a password manager. It’s available across iOS and Android; it has native desktop applications on Windows, macOS, and Linux; and it also integrates with every major browser including Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75mSmW"&gt;Bitwarden’s security has also been audited by a &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/blog/post/third-party-security-audit/"&gt;third-party security company&lt;/a&gt;, and although it uses the cloud to sync your passwords between devices, it says it &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/security-faqs/#q-why-should-i-trust-bitwarden-with-my-passwords"&gt;stores them in an encrypted form&lt;/a&gt; that only you can unlock. You also have the option of protecting your Bitwarden account with two-factor authentication to provide an extra layer of security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSnLRV"&gt;Importing our passwords was easy, and Bitwarden has guides for many popular password managers &lt;a href="https://bitwarden.com/help/article/import-data/"&gt;in its support pages&lt;/a&gt;. It supports biometric security on iOS and Android, and all of its software is nicely designed and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3LVJt"&gt;Bitwarden does have paid tiers, but we think most people will be able to do without most of the features they offer. Paying gets you access to encrypted file attachments, more second-factor security options, and reports on the overall security of the passwords you have in use. But even on the free tier, you can perform checks to see if individual passwords have been leaked in a password breach. Paying also gets you access to a built-in one-time code generator for two-factor authentication, but it’s easy and arguably more secure to use a separate app for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="adLPe6"&gt;
&lt;div id="v1bSwP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374175" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b5bYvK"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W4CLAh"&gt;Runner-up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NINYyc"&gt;As part of our research, we also tried a variety of other password managers. Of these, Zoho Vault is another feature-packed free option, but its interface isn’t as good as Bitwarden’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TV0j4n"&gt;Zoho Vault&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/te5Nptg-a0LIJ9LVkmym530PCqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22307342/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_11.44.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoho&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JsCPLN"&gt;Zoho Vault’s iOS and Android apps are nice enough, but its browser extension is a little clunky and buries useful features like its password generator behind one too many sub menus. It’s also unclear if the software has gone through a third-party security audit; the company didn’t respond to our query in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HDhzhT"&gt;
&lt;div id="lvNPQw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10374191" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"description_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Sh7FnA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZVmKXa"&gt;Also-rans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EHSM1e"&gt;There were two other free password managers we felt weren’t up to Bitwarden and Zoho Vault’s standards. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Ffeature%2Fpassword-manager&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Norton Password Manager&lt;/a&gt; has the advantage of coming from a well-known cybersecurity company. But we found the way it attempts to simplify its setup process actually makes things more confusing, and Norton’s support pages didn’t do a great job at helping us work out where we’d gone wrong. Norton didn’t respond to our email asking whether the software has gone through a third-party security audit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBHbtd"&gt;We also gave &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LogMeOnce&lt;/a&gt; a try, but we weren’t reassured by the presence of ads in its smartphone app. It also asked for many more permissions than the other password managers we tried. The company says this is necessary to enable its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logmeonce.com%2Fmugshot%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mugshot feature&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to give you information about unauthorized attempts to access your account, which is an optional feature. The company says it regularly hires third-party security researchers to test its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fAyOSv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Until recently, LastPass would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some changes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rtVzg"&gt;Until recently, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lastpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; would have been included as a free password manager, but it’s making some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;changes to its free tier&lt;/a&gt; on March 16th that mean it will be much less usable as a free password manager. After that date, free users will be able to view and manage passwords on just a single category of devices: mobile or computer. “Mobile” subscribers will have access to phones, tablets, and smartwatches, while “Computer” subscribers will be able to use the service across PCs, Macs, and browser extensions. Given how most people switch between these two classes of devices on a daily basis, we think this will severely limit how useful LastPass’ free tier will be for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWv32v"&gt;Our focus on simplicity also means we’ve excluded &lt;a href="https://keepass.info/"&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;, a password manager that relies on third-party apps on non-Windows platforms. In addition, if you want to sync your passwords between devices, you have to use a third-party storage service such as Dropbox or Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zzjfrc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G2WMgx"&gt;Beyond the free options, there’s a huge array of paid password managers out there. Some of these have free tiers, but they’re so restrictive that they’re effectively not usable as a day-to-day password manager. &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://1password.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most well-known paid option, but others include &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnordpass.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;NordPass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.remembear.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RememBear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.keepsolid.com%2Fpasswarden%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Passwarden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dashlane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.roboform.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311182%2Fbest-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RoboForm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.enpass.io/"&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt;, all of which limit their free versions in ways that we think make them unsuitable for long-term use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4z8pE"&gt;Finally, most modern internet browsers offer built-in password management features, but we think it’s worth taking the time to store your passwords in a standalone service. It gives you more flexibility to switch platforms and browsers in the future, and password managers also generally have interfaces that are better suited to the task of storing passwords. To make things simpler for yourself, you might want to turn off the built-in password manager in your browser once you’ve picked a standalone version to use, so you don’t run the risk of having passwords stored in two places at once.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is popular at vaccination sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JYDo2M9w5mF98CH3mK221IW8bmI=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917888/1231516410.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLP8LB"&gt;The messaging that all three authorized vaccines are good options appears to be sinking in around the country. When the first batch of single-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccines arrived in States this week, people were excited to take it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBqtcI"&gt;In Connecticut, Hartford HealthCare let people decide which type of vaccine to sign up for, and the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1367146604231294980"&gt;more popular&lt;/a&gt; than expected. People were also given the choice at a Miami vaccination site. One recipient &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/us/miami-vaccines-pfizer-johnson-and-johnson/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that she picked Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson because it’s one dose; she’s afraid of needles and only wanted to do it once. A Minnesota couple &lt;a href="https://kttc.com/2021/03/04/rochester-residents-begin-receiving-the-one-and-done-johnson-johnson-vaccine/"&gt;told KTTC-TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that they were eager to get a vaccine that was only one dose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37aI0V"&gt;That’s a big relief for experts who worried that the shot faced a communications problem. Even though the vaccine was just as good as the other two authorized vaccines at keeping people out of the hospital and alive, overall, its ability to prevent disease wasn’t quite as strong during the trials testing it. They thought there might be the (mostly unfounded) perception that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine wasn’t a good option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnwtrI"&gt;“We have a vaccine now that has good efficacy that everyone is going to compare to the existing vaccines, and say it doesn’t look quite as good,” said Eric Rubin, a professor of immunology, during a meeting of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee last week. Experts stressed that people should take whichever vaccine they’re offered first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N5mRqO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Re: J&amp;amp;J 72% vs Pfizer/Moderna 95% – it's sorta like comparing scores of golfers who teed off during a calm morning to those who teed off at 1pm when winds were howling. While it's hard to make precise adjustment, it's clear that equally good play will result in different scores.&lt;/p&gt;— Bob Wachter (@Bob_Wachter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bob_Wachter/status/1367828152936898561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O59pcU"&gt;But despite those early concerns, people around the country seem eager to line up for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. In addition to only requiring one dose — so people don’t have to take the time for two appointments — it can have &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/02/26/j-j-covid-vaccine-fda-coronavirus-pfizer-moderna/6806367002/"&gt;fewer side effects&lt;/a&gt; than the gene-based Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udPshg"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00409-0%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100084481%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22315138%2Fcovid-vaccine-single-shot-johnson-distribution" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard to directly compare&lt;/a&gt; the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to the other vaccines. They were tested at different times and in different locations. The gene-based vaccines were tested before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; that could make vaccines less effective were widespread. But all three vaccines are similar in one important way: they’re overwhelmingly effective at keeping people from developing severe cases of COVID-19 and out of the hospital. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22307585/covid-19-vaccine-johnson-and-johnson-efficacy"&gt;all more effective than the flu shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yotU9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s looking like the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine is very popular. Accounted for 984 doses, versus 1,166 for Pfizer. (FEMA had said they only had 500 J&amp;amp;J each day, but spox said had some leftover from Wed and got more)&lt;/p&gt;— Doug Hanks (@doug_hanks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/doug_hanks/status/1367650936940822537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4861Us"&gt;The single-dose formulation is also more convenient. “It’s a hassle having to take time off work,” Salome Ruperty told &lt;a href="https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2021/03/05/bronx-residents-line-up-to-be-the-first-to-receive-johnson---johnson-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Spectrum News NY1&lt;/a&gt; while lined up at a Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine site in New York City. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2enu7Z"&gt;Some people may still turn down the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine and seek out either the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech shots. But the early reports make it seem less likely that the doses will go unused. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bbcqo7"&gt;Just under &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/03/01/972538146/johnson-johnson-vaccine-rollout-begins-in-u-s-as-covid-19-cases-tick-up"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine were distributed to States this week. The company says it will have 20 million doses ready by the end of March and 100 million by June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PlayStation 5 is restocked at Best Buy [Update: Sold Out]</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmgJsSjvy-7_lF3d1iG8M-9LoNU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917771/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6v1Hxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 2021 1:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy has sold out of both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition models. If you are still looking for an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, it is still available on the retailer’s website. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYCYSU"&gt;The PlayStation 5 has been out for over three months now. Since then, it has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;one of the most difficult gadgets to purchase&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for another shot to get this console, Best Buy has the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053780700716864" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734053639217049019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; models up for purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Vave"&gt;If you are looking for an Xbox Series X / S instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315452/xbox-series-x-s-restock-best-buy-price-pass-controller"&gt;Best Buy has also restocked Microsoft’s next-gen consoles today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YgwrHO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Rd70W"&gt;Once you obtain your PS5, there are a few items you’re going to want to pick up for your console. Some of the most popular PS5 exclusives right now include &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games or the PS5 version of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-PlayStation-5/dp/B08VJNMWR8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is now available on Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1Uls0S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh2iyW"&gt;If you plan to play local co-op with family or friends, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723570939328512577" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an extra DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; might also be a good item to pick up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;One thing I also recommend buying is &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners, that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that were released originally on PS4, including &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted IV: A Thief’s End. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ll53Kj"&gt;There’s no way to expand the SSD storage in your PS5 yet, but Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"&gt;reportedly expanding the options for more SSD storage&lt;/a&gt; sometime this summer. But, if you want to store some older PS4 titles on your console so you don’t use your limited SSD storage, I strongly advise &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_Black-Drive-External-Compatible-WDBA3A0050BBK-WESN/dp/B07VMTNDMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buying an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt; to store those titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xtdOUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6gezA1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="SBR5ek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony will reportedly enable PS5 SSD expansion this summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302646/sony-ps5-ssd-expansion-coming-summer-report"},{"title":"Best Buy has stock available for the Xbox Series X and S right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22303116/xbox-series-x-s-restock"},{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="P5Bi9M"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla launches a social platform and is closing its forums</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v6HMpHyLx4LJheAYNDGxxPwdG3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917667/tesla_cybertruck_056.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="keYLew"&gt;Tesla has launched a new social platform of sorts on its website geared at letting owners and fans of the brand “[t]ake actions on behalf of Tesla and the movement for cleaner energy.” The new microsite — called the “Tesla Engagement Platform” — already features information about how Nebraska residents can help support the company’s push to allow direct sales and service in the state, upcoming owner events, and fundraising for disaster relief in Texas following the recent winter storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFo4RO"&gt;“Engage Tesla is a new platform for both Tesla’s public policy team and Tesla Owner’s Clubs,” the first &lt;a href="https://engage.tesla.com/articles/14-welcome-tesla-engagement-platform"&gt;post on the new microsite reads&lt;/a&gt;. “Its goal is to create a digital home base for all of our work, and make it easier for Tesla community members to learn what’s top of mind for us, take meaningful action, and stay in the loop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6ZUso"&gt;At the same time, Tesla is also closing the long-standing forums section of its website. While there are many Tesla-related forums on the internet now, Tesla’s own message board was one of the first places where owners and interested buyers could gather and discuss the good and bad things about the company’s products. It was also unmoderated, which led to constant problems with spam and trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEQ1g0"&gt;Tesla’s message boards still served that purpose to this day, but a notice at the top appeared this week telling users that the forums will become read-only starting March 15th. “To continue the conversation with the Tesla community,” the notice reads, “visit engage.tesla.com.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CVakSA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s forums were a place to kvetch, but they often got bogged down by bots and trolls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W8Gwhk"&gt;The Tesla Engagement Platform appears to be an effort to further harness the potent enthusiasm of the company’s supporters by centralizing some of the work they were already doing on their own. For instance, the Silicon Valley-based Tesla Owners club &lt;a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/02/20/tesla-owners-rallying-to-provide-aid-to-austin/"&gt;had already raised $10,000 to support the Del Valle, Texas community&lt;/a&gt;, which surrounds the area in which the company’s new factory is being built. And Tesla owners have long lobbied their governments to adopt green energy policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WS2K1a"&gt;But there’s never been as direct a feedback loop with the company’s policy team as is being promised with the new microsite. The new site also makes it easy for people to apply for membership to local owners’ clubs and see upcoming events. It also tracks with Tesla’s recent efforts to bring die-hard supporters even deeper into the fold, like when the company started taking questions from retail shareholders on its earnings calls.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8bIRb"&gt;Being an “engagement platform,” there is also a commenting system, which a number of users have already employed to share their ideas for improvements. Some want a better direct line to the company’s oft-criticized customer service department. But one of the most common suggestions so far is to &lt;a href="https://engage.tesla.com/comments/396"&gt;keep the old forums around&lt;/a&gt;, or at least replace the message board with something similar — but moderated — on the new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vVWEy"&gt;“Please do not get rid of the Forums. This is not a replacement. The forums (with exception of the trolls on it) brought about informed discussion to help fellow owners with issues,” one user wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CdfeXy"&gt;Meanwhile, over on the official (and now officially doomed) Tesla forums, users are sharing their thoughts about the sudden decision &lt;a href="https://forums.tesla.com/discussion/183426/end-of-tesla-forums"&gt;in this thread&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5rZj2"&gt;“Welcome to the end of the line. You have exactly 13 more days to post threads and comments,” the initial post reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1JXuo"&gt;“This engagement site looks very limited, can’t envision it being an adequate replacement,” one user wrote. “Where are y’all going to visit? Feels like a couple of years ago when my golf club shuttered up. Scrambling to find a new home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kG1mi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 2021 11:37AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Best Buy has restocks available for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051808434335616" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; consoles. You can find additional information on both here. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>With Disney’s Raya and the Last Dragon, I feel seen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Raya, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, seeks the help of the legendary dragon Sisu, voiced by Awkwafina. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3QgIOEyEZpBvJoiecxQryYu4awo=/357x0:1563x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68917610/raya_online_use_217_abfccdd8__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Raya, voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, seeks the help of the legendary dragon Sisu, voiced by Awkwafina.  | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tmNbzK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeRayaLastDragon030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is so much more than just the latest Disney flick, at least for me. Admittedly, I’m not even a huge Disney fan. But somehow because of &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a little girl in me who finally feels seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kkdu1"&gt;Growing up in America, I hardly ever saw Asians in movies or television. And if I did, they were rarely brown and Southeast Asian like me. Finally, that’s changing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PaVwNc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Growing up in America, I hardly ever saw Asians in movies or television&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rr39pM"&gt;Raya is voiced by Kelly Marie Tran, who is Vietnamese American. The film is inspired by diverse Southeast Asian cultures. The screenplay was written by Qui Nguyen and Adele Lim, who both trace their roots back to Southeast Asia. That’s one reason why there are so many cool cultural easter Eggs to find in the film. &lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/raya-and-the-last-dragon-finds-magic-in-southeast-asian-tradition/"&gt;Raya’s name&lt;/a&gt; means “celebration” in Malay. She gets around by riding atop her animal sidekick named “Tuk Tuk,” who shares its name with Cambodia’s iconic &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/society/article/2097978/what-will-become-cambodias-endangered-tuk-tuk-drivers"&gt;motorbike-powered carriages&lt;/a&gt; (you’ll find similar sets of wheels across much of Southeast Asia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dTEkGA"&gt;In a teaser that almost made me cry (and I’m not a cryer), Raya wields what look like bamboo &lt;a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/10/21/20/is-that-arnis-disneys-raya-teaser-has-filipino-fans-gushing"&gt;Arnis sticks&lt;/a&gt; — weapons used in Filipino martial arts. Her &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/how-raya-last-dragon-built-southeast-asian-fantasy-world-n1259465"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; is reminiscent of the Indonesian kris. The epic combat scenes in the film also draw from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney"&gt;fighting styles&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2021/3/2/22309833/raya-and-the-last-dragon-dragon-design-disney"&gt;Thailand, Malaysia,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.asianjournal.com/entertainment/showbiz/raya-and-the-last-dragon-finds-inspiration-in-the-cultures-people-of-southeast-asia/"&gt;Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tuk Tuk and Raya" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aL_XBQHJHv5FCm9BDJ3QkLl6wEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347856/a7a4cf9275d430e60b5bc946b0e9b551_4096x1715_d23efbaa.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuk Tuk and Raya&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FUnOok"&gt;If a lot of that is unfamiliar to you, I don’t blame you. I was born in the Philippines and I didn’t even learn about Arnis until I was in college in the US. When you don’t see yourself reflected in the world around you, you lose out on a lot. That’s why it means so much to see Raya, brown and badass, wielding the same weapons that my ancestors did to fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SlwSQ"&gt;As a whole, Asian Americans are already underrepresented in media — but Southeast Asians are often even more overlooked. “Asian American” is an enormous umbrella that encompasses many peoples, cultures, and languages. Lumping everyone into one group can obscure that diversity. Even worse, it can make some communities and the inequities they face invisible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fl2Vfo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Southeast Asians are often even more overlooked&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VgtPhc"&gt;That’s a problem that’s often talked about as a lack of “&lt;a href="http://aapidata.com/blog/countmein-unemployment-poverty/"&gt;disaggregated data&lt;/a&gt;” for the Asian American and Pacific Islander umbrella group. There often isn’t enough data collected that breaks down how experiences vary from group to group. For instance, many Southeast Asians came to the US as refugees after the Vietnam War or the Cambodian genocide by the Khmer Rouge — and that can make their migration stories, and the resources they have access to in America, very different than others who immigrated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pw5Q0y"&gt;Poverty among Hmong Americans, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/10/29/history-hmong-americans-explains-why-they-might-decide-election/"&gt;came to the US as refugees&lt;/a&gt; after cooperating with the US during its “Secret War” in Laos, is twice as high — &lt;a href="https://www.searac.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/SEARAC_NationalSnapshot_PrinterFriendly.pdf"&gt;26 percent&lt;/a&gt; — as it is among the Asian American community as a whole. That kind of data is necessary to dispel the Asian model minority myth, a stereotype that harms all Asian Americans because it wrongly assumes that our communities already have access to all the resources we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KzhoL4"&gt;If you’ve seen &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt; or even just its trailers, then you know that the movie is about how to bring communities together. Disaggregating data isn’t about dividing anyone. To bring folks together, you have to first &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt; each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a9Ez0r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;data is necessary to dispel the Asian model minority myth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hYs1f"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1008466/9358?subId1=VergeRayaLastDragon030521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we see its characters face adversity that fits into Southeast Asia’s modern history: there’s war, loss, hunger, and a long search for healing. The leading characters form a sort of blended family of refugees who are building a new world together after each of them have lost nearly everything.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NT1x69"&gt;I’m not saying the movie and its depictions are perfect. It’s a Disney-fied version of real life, after all. The movie still &lt;a href="https://jumpcutonline.co.uk/2021/03/01/review-raya-and-the-last-dragon-2021/"&gt;blends&lt;/a&gt; all the different cultures of Southeast Asia into a single fantasy world, and Disney’s been criticized in the past for creating a monolithic culture in movies like &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/critics-accuse-disney-culture-theft-ahead-moana-release-n685866"&gt;Moana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/disney-mulan-review/"&gt;Mulan&lt;/a&gt; that again “aggregate” aspects from different peoples. &lt;em&gt;Raya&lt;/em&gt; will probably face a whole lot of scrutiny, in part because of the pressure to fairly represent a huge group of people whose stories largely haven’t been told in mainstream media before. I’m already feeling the pressure from writing this post, knowing that there are things I’ll fail to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy6gyO"&gt;But in this case, I’ll take an argument about how a story should be told over no story at all. Hopefully, it opens up room for more stories to surface. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xbox Series X and S are available at Best Buy [Update: Series X sold out]</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7PQdwZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 2021 12:58PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox Series X is now sold out at Best Buy. But the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is still available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OUbImx"&gt;Best Buy has randomly restocked supplies for both of Microsoft’s recently released next-gen consoles: the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734057697429018006" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734051814155050893" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt;. Like some other gaming gadgets released late last year, these consoles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt; to buy, but if you move quickly, you can grab one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXr832"&gt;If you are looking for a PS5 instead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22311269/playstation-5-ps5-restock-digital-edition-console-best-buy"&gt;Best Buy has stock available for both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9cSMZS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llSpqU"&gt;If you are new to the Xbox console family, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.costco.com%2Fxbox-series-s-with-additional-controller.product.100699182.html"&gt;Costco is also selling a Series S console bundle&lt;/a&gt; with an extra controller for $340.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCIQXi"&gt;If you secure either console and wonder what to buy next, you might want to think about what games to add to your library. But if you’re unsure what to get, I suggest buying a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for console or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-3-Month-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Microsoft-Digital-Download%2F309259942%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly suggest Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it includes additional perks, most notably a membership for Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BXin5w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w6T2Lp"&gt;I also advise you to buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extra controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. When it comes to additional storage, both consoles are rather limited: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the Series X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D1Dj1"&gt;If you plan to download some older games, but want to save your limited SSD, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G7PrYx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZjEy29"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="WLrsYu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
