    <title>SpaceX lands Starship prototype for the first time — and then it blows up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jqSO4oMvrQNpZH6BCNCyKVF3wCA=/190x0:1780x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906793/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_6.23.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SN10 standing upright after landing | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrekpF"&gt;SpaceX’s latest Starship prototype landed on Wednesday for the first time after carrying out a high-altitude test flight in Texas — but exploded minutes later on its landing pad. The rocket, an early test version called SN10, demonstrated a few complex dances in mid-air before clinching a soft touch down, aiming to nail a key milestone in Elon Musk’s campaign to build a fully reusable rocket system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqcVk1"&gt;After aborting an initial launch attempt earlier in the day, the prototype lifted off at 6:14pm ET and soared 6 miles above SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities. Unlike the last two tests with SN8 and SN9, which launched successfully but exploded on their landing attempts, SN10 stuck a lopsided landing on a slab of concrete not far from its launchpad, appearing to survive its daring landing maneuver for a few moments before being consumed in a fireball.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A SpaceX Starship prototype explodes on the pad" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZZAN-d2GwJELQwl55wm69XrK3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343794/boom.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA Spaceflight&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yaAJux"&gt;The launch test’s main objective was to demonstrate the computer-controlled movements of the rocket’s four aerodynamic flaps that steer its descent before landing, SpaceX engineer and live stream host John Insprucker said during the company’s broadcast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzkMcM"&gt;At the end of its climb to 6.2 miles, each of the the rocket’s three Raptor engines gradually shut down to prepare for a brief free-fall back to land, reorienting itself horizontally with its “belly” facing the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fg5zAm"&gt;Then came the “belly flop” maneuver. The rocket’s three engines reignited to swoop itself into a vertical position for landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mPd2i2"&gt;

&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/EccrPJ3Vw8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EccrPJ3Vw8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1367255944049143814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bD8BTD"&gt;SN10 slowly descended on its landing pad, softly touching down but leaning slightly to the side. Insprucker declared it a success on SpaceX’s live feed: “Third time’s a charm, as the saying goes. We’ve had a successful soft touchdown on the landing pad.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qHDWP"&gt;“As a reminder, the key point of today’s test flight was to gather the data on controlling the vehicle while reentering, and we were successful in doing so,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkhrTr"&gt;The SpaceX live feed ended before SN10’s explosive demise. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUu1lih2RifWkKtDOJdsBA"&gt;Another feed&lt;/a&gt;, provided by the website &lt;a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/"&gt;NASA Spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, kept the cameras rolling and captured the fireball, which lofted the 16-story-tall rocket back into the air before crashing back down on its side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAzo9U"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1367272378766614529"&gt;tweeted at 7:35PM ET to celebrate&lt;/a&gt; that SN10 landed “in one piece,” but jokingly noted two minutes after that the rocket had an “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1367272937632497664?s=20"&gt;honorable discharge&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MoU3kf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;RIP SN10, honorable discharge&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1367272937632497664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h57KBb"&gt;Starship is SpaceX’s next-generation, fully reusable Mars rocket system designed to ferry crews of astronauts and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to Earth orbit, the moon and eventually Mars. The last three prototypes SpaceX has test-launched are early versions of the top half of the full Starship system, whose bottom half is a reusable super-heavy booster powered by an array of SpaceX’s new Raptor rocket engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNDmNH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 3rd, 7:44PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweets from Elon Musk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peak Design congratulates Amazon for copying its signature sling bag so well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlQADBn7bFBt3TqVikCrW0nUkKQ=/636x0:4284x2432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906567/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_11.08.14_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Peak Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91sTrL"&gt;Peak Design, a maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/26/16031314/verge-editors-choice-peak-design-everyday-backpack"&gt;fine bags and accessories&lt;/a&gt;, has a problem: Amazon appears to have copied its popular bag, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Peak-Design-Everyday-Sling-Ash/dp/B07ZTQNBMX/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics+everyday+sling&amp;amp;qid=1614799442&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzS05XRllWWTU2MDNUJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNDQ1ODczMkZMTUlVMTVQU0dYUSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODkwMDAwM0FHUE5RTzhCTTVZNSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.95 Everyday Sling&lt;/a&gt;, with its own &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Everyday-Sling-Inches-Black/dp/B084CG43XD/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics+everyday+sling&amp;amp;qid=1614799394&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$32.99 Amazon Basics Camera Bag&lt;/a&gt;. It was even called Everyday Sling until Peak Design’s video. Rather than do anything drastic, yet, Peak Design &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbxWGjQ2szQ"&gt;decided to make a video&lt;/a&gt; about what customers “gain” by purchasing Amazon’s version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XItoh"&gt;The video presents Peak’s case clearly: the bags are similarly shaped, with pockets, labels, and straps in the exact same places. As someone unfamiliar with Peak Design’s bags, if I wasn’t paying attention or didn’t read “Peak Design” on the label, I’d probably mix them up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_mRdyQO6sby6eidXXOILDKOMqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343026/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_11.08.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peak Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Basics Everyday Sling on the left and Peak Design’s Everyday Sling on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kWoFhF"&gt;Peak presents all of this humorously, but the evidence is surprisingly blatant, which makes Amazon’s apparent decision to change its Amazon Basics version from “Everyday Sling” to “Amazon Basics Camera Bag” all the more suspicious. There’s even evidence: “Everyday Sling” is still in the URL for the “Camera Bag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaKFqD"&gt;Peak Design isn’t the first smaller company to try to stand up to Amazon. When Allbirds discovered Amazon was selling what looked like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/19/20874818/amazon-allbirds-shoe-clone-copy-sneaker-206-collective-private-label"&gt;a pretty obvious Allbirds clone&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO wrote &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@joeyzwillinger/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705"&gt;a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Amazon, even though he claimed he was “flattered” by the similarities between the shoes. Amazon’s copying hasn’t stopped there. The company’s also been accused of cloning car trunk organizers and seat cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bPtP4Z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10372737"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8wgAfF"&gt;The whole trend has only served to draw attention to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;potential antitrust issue that’s long concerned the company’s critics&lt;/a&gt;, as well as lawmakers and regulators. The basic problem: Amazon owns and operates its e-commerce platform and also runs an ever-growing list of in-house brands that compete against Amazon’s own third-party Marketplace sellers on that same platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgao5a"&gt;Undercutting the competition is as simple, in theory, as seeing what’s selling well, creating a similar, cheaper product, and then suggesting it to Amazon shoppers. In fact, that very situation is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;heart of a European Union investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the company’s operations, which resulted in the European Commission accusing Amazon of “systematically” using seller data to unfairly compete against its own merchants in France and Germany last November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3Wa0G"&gt;Amazon says it has a policy in place to prevent third-party seller data from being used for products, but &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggests it’s still happened. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akz48p/jeff-bezos-has-no-idea-how-often-amazon-rips-off-its-sellers"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, even former CEO Jeff Bezos was unable to confirm if the policy had been broken during the House Judiciary Committee’s investigation into Amazon’s monopoly status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwaCjY"&gt;In Peak Design’s case, the company said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it believes Amazon has actually infringed on its intellectual property, but it chose to make the video to highlight the differences between the products and has no plans to take legal action now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMKNJt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/create-review/error?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;channel=glance-detail&amp;amp;asin=B084CG43XD"&gt;Reviews are currently disabled&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon’s bag because the company noticed “unusual reviewing activity.” Looking at some of the newest reviews, several of the lowest ratings have been left by customers directly referencing Peak Design’s video. Taken with Amazon’s decision to change the product’s name, it seems like Peak Design has struck a cord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A2RJb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Amazon about Peak Design’s claim and we will update if we receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tells Texas it wants to create 1,800 jobs with a $17 billion factory in Austin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFCWVqYcfrRqy8s4GTOBE1bfF7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68906140/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvzK76"&gt;Samsung has submitted paperwork to Texas officials, requesting a billion dollars in tax incentives to make Austin the future home of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243994/samsung-chipmaking-texas-plant-3nm-10-billion-report"&gt;$17 billion chip factory&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-03/samsung-details-plans-for-17-billion-chip-facility-in-u-s?utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;noted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and reported last month by &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://assets.comptroller.texas.gov/ch313/1554/1554-manor-samsung-app.pdf"&gt;In the documents&lt;/a&gt;, which were filed in January, the company says it plans on bringing 1,800 permanent jobs to the factory over the first 10 years, with an average starting salary around $66K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDrkFB"&gt;In return, Samsung is &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;asking for a break on its property taxes&lt;/a&gt;: it’s looking for a 100 percent break on its payments to Travis County for 20 years, which the company estimates would save it roughly $718 million, and a 50 percent break on the taxes to the City of Austin for five years, with an estimated $87 million. It also wants the state to subsidize its property tax payments to the school district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MndPp"&gt;It seems like Samsung is still trying to decide where to put the factory: in the documents, the company calls the project “highly competitive,” and says that “[d]ue to the higher tax cost of operating in Texas, the appraised value limitation is a determining factor. Without the appraised value limitation award, the company would likely locate the project in Arizona, New York or Korea.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlN5Rw"&gt;If Samsung chooses Austin, it would be expanding its existing plant there — the company already has a chip-making fab in the city, which has been there since 1997. The factory currently employs around 10,000 people, and the &lt;em&gt;Austin American-Statesman&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.statesman.com/story/business/2021/02/04/samsung-austin-expansion-chip-plant-seeks-1-billion-taxpayer-incentives/4309503001/"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; Samsung has recently bought 257.7 acres of land near its existing factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ZIyW"&gt;Looking for incentives from cities and states is nothing new, but Samsung is asking for quite a lot, especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21323977/austin-tesla-tax-breaks-travis-county-cybertruck-factory-incentives"&gt;compared to Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, which is also building a factory in Austin: the car manufacturer only got around $60 million in tax rebates from the county and school district. The two planned factories aren’t directly comparable due to differences in cost, employment numbers and salaries, and more, but Samsung’s still looking for an order of magnitude more than Tesla received. It could be that Samsung used the billion-dollar figure as an opening negotiation, but any deals being worked on don’t yet seem to be public.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Losing YouTube on the old Apple TV underscores how far ahead competitors are</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vgNgIDxQvifYJQMBBbMX2HPZt3s=/0x0:1037x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905907/appletv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ktv7q8"&gt;The YouTube app on older Apple TV models has officially been discontinued as of today. If you have a third-generation device (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/3/14/2870779/apple-tv-review-2012"&gt;the 2012-era model&lt;/a&gt; that predated the modern tvOS-based set-top boxes), you’ll only be able to stream YouTube through an iOS device using AirPlay starting today, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/03/older-apple-tv-will-require-airplay-for-youtube-video-playback-starting-next-month/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbm3Xl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;While the news&lt;/a&gt; has been known for a while, the change highlights a key issue with the Apple TV ecosystem. Namely, that it’s been nearly three and a half years since Apple has last updated its streaming box hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YzIXC"&gt;If you own the old model with the now defunct YouTube app, your only Apple-made option is the Apple TV 4K, released in September 2017. That’s particularly problematic, given that the Apple TV 4K still starts at $179 (with a pricier 64GB model that offers double the storage for $199), despite being released years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xL6HP2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best streaming device to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="131UHf"&gt;That’s in stark comparison to competitors like Amazon, Google, and Roku, which have released newer streaming products that offer the same (if not better) features than Apple’s outdated box at far lower prices. Roku’s flagship streaming box, the Roku Ultra, costs $99 — nearly half the price of the entry-level Apple TV 4K — while supporting 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, and Apple’s own AirPlay 2 streaming. The $50 Streaming Stick Plus offers 4K and HDR (without Dolby Vision) for those looking to save even more money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzpZWk"&gt;Amazon’s Fire TV Cube costs $119.99 and offers similar high-end streaming specs, while also doubling as a full-fledged Echo speaker. Like Roku, Amazon also has its cheaper $50 Fire TV Stick 4K, which offers the full gamut of streaming support (Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10+, and HDR10) without the added Alexa speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4oWWs"&gt;And of course, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Google’s latest Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, which costs just $50, offers excellent content curation, supports 4K, HDR, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision, and remains &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best choice for a streaming stick in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Khq9Gq"&gt;With more and more apps starting to end support for Apple’s older streaming boxes (CBS All Access has already announced that it’ll be enacting a similar change when Paramount Plus launches), the problem of the Apple TV’s outdated hardware and pricing are only going to continue to grow. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B6Vb1x"&gt;Apple has added a service that lets you automatically transfer photos, videos, and albums from your iCloud Photo Library to Google Photos (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/03/apple-transfer-icloud-photos-google-photos/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The feature has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208514"&gt;a support document outlining the procedure&lt;/a&gt;, which simply entails going to &lt;a href="https://privacy.apple.com/"&gt;privacy.apple.com&lt;/a&gt;, logging in, and going through the “transfer a copy of your data” process. Apple says the transfer will take between three days to a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlPxfA"&gt;Some things won’t transfer: Apple says shared albums, smart albums, photo stream content, live photos, some metadata, and media that isn’t stored in your iCloud Photo Library won’t come along for the ride. The part about Live Photos is especially eyebrow-raising. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207310"&gt;iPhones take Live Photos by default&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple doesn’t make it clear if the entire picture will be left behind, or just the video clip surrounding it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mk15DTxUNHvZ7V2VrURoGN8T2rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343247/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_12.23.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MKDR7D"&gt;For what it’s worth, the transfer tool tells me 10,793 of my photos will be transferred, which is the exact number of pictures in my library. Given that over 2,500 of those are Live, it would seem Apple is planning on transferring them, but we did reach out to clarify. At the time of writing, we haven't heard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOq2XL"&gt;Apple says the feature won’t remove anything from your iCloud Photo Library; it will simply make a copy of it, so you’ll still need to manually delete things if you no longer want them stored in iCloud. Additionally, the feature is currently only available to people in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHmI7k"&gt;If you’re looking to make the jump from iPhone to Android or just want to use Google Photos, this tool should provide an easy way to quickly transfer all of your photos to the service without having to reupload them yourself. A few clicks, and your photos will be on their way to their new home. Just make sure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;you have enough Google storage space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Great apes receive COVID-19 vaccine at San Diego Zoo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo outside the San Diego Zoo on a sunny day. The sign for the zoo has its name in big green letters. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MrZ31n9flVto500UZcU1d4r4SZo=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905789/1218313654.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Diego Zoo.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Daniel Knighton/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N26I4F"&gt;Several great apes at the San Diego Zoo received two doses each of a COVID-19 vaccine in February, &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/first-great-apes-at-us-zoo-receive-coronavirus-vaccine-made-for-animals"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The lucky recipients are four orangutans and five bonobos, who were distracted with treats as they got their shots. One of the orangutans is Karen, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-08-28-mn-32264-story.html"&gt;first ape to undergo open-heart surgery&lt;/a&gt; in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8lowd"&gt;Ape vaccination is a welcome development at the San Diego Zoo, where a troop of eight gorillas &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/gorillas-san-diego-zoo-positive-coronavirus"&gt;tested positive for COVID-19 in January&lt;/a&gt;. The sick gorillas were symptomatic but &lt;a href="https://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/pressroom/news-releases/guests-can-once-again-visit-gorilla-troop-san-diego-zoo-safari-park"&gt;have now recovered&lt;/a&gt;, according to the zoo. They’ll likely join their orangutan and bonobo compatriots in vaccination later in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F5sG1x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;developed by a veterinary pharmaceutical company after the first recorded case of COVID-19 in a dog&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOOpDQ"&gt;The vaccine the apes received is not one of the vaccines that have been authorized for humans. It was developed by a veterinary pharmaceutical company after the first recorded case of COVID-19 in a dog in February 2020. In addition to dogs and gorillas, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549737/denmark-cull-mink-coronavirus-outbreak-mutation"&gt;minks&lt;/a&gt;, domestic cats, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21211217/pets-cats-tigers-bronx-zoo-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;big cats&lt;/a&gt; have also been infected by the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xs9UTG"&gt;After the vaccine was confirmed to be safe and effective for dogs and cats, Nadine Lamberski, chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, decided to start vaccinating the apes, &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixYuGO"&gt;Lamberski says it’s common to give vaccines to species that are different from the ones they were tested on because they’re developed for specific pathogens, not specific species. The apes haven’t had any adverse reactions, and they’re being tested for antibodies to see if the vaccine is working. Lamberski’s team will continue collecting and sharing data about the vaccine’s effectiveness as more apes are vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20CqTU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 3rd, 6:42PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this post referred to Nadine Lamberski as the chief conservation and wildlife health officer at the San Diego Zoo. She holds that position at the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance, the zoo’s parent organization. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sinking City developer uses DMCA request to get its own game removed from Steam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdR7NUUVg5fGL43glfdsIQ3I2H0=/138x0:1625x991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905771/sc5qqo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Frogwares&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z0YbvM"&gt;Valve has removed &lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt; from its digital storefront Steam after the company received a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) request from the game’s developer Frogwares, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epdw7p/the-sinking-city-developer-uses-dmca-to-remove-its-own-game-from-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Frogwares claims that the game’s original publisher, Nacon, hacked and pirated the game and republished it on Steam without the studio’s knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVZp4F"&gt;A Valve spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday evening that the company was able to collect “extremely strong evidence to indicate this version of the game was pirated,” and that the version of &lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt; published on its digital storefront “contains content that Nacon has absolutely no rights to — namely &lt;em&gt;The Merciful Madness&lt;/em&gt; DLC.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LB93Pd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt;’s PC version is still purchasable as a self-published title&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vO0hPB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt; initially launched in 2019, but Frogwares announced last year it would &lt;a href="https://frogwares.com/the-sinking-city-is-being-delisted-heres-why/"&gt;pull the game from stores&lt;/a&gt;, citing back payment that Nacon owed the studio. Nacon &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-03-03-the-sinking-city-dev-dmcas-its-own-game-to-force-it-off-steam"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Eurogame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; that it accused the developer of “playing the victim” and said it had paid the studio more than €10 million to date. In &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/26/22303653/the-sinking-city-steam-frogwares-nacon-pc"&gt;late February&lt;/a&gt;, Nacon put the game back on Steam, which Frogwares says was actually a pirated version of the game that was unassociated with the studio (and which has since been removed following the DMCA request).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlPSOh"&gt;Currently, &lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt;’s Steam page does appear in a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+sinking+city&amp;amp;oq=The+Sinking+City&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.0.0i131i355i433j46i131i433j0i131i433j69i59j0i131i433l2j69i60j69i61.895j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;web browser search&lt;/a&gt;, but clicking on it redirects you to the homepage for the web version of Steam. &lt;em&gt;The Sinking City&lt;/em&gt;'s PC version is still purchasable as a self-published title from Frogwares through other storefronts, such as &lt;a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/search?searchString=the%2520sinking%2520city"&gt;Origin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2021) review: the write stuff</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Your best bet for a budget phone with a stylus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eyIWAy"&gt;Calling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-moto-g-stylus-gen-2%2Fp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22311690%2Fmotorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2021 Motorola Moto G Stylus&lt;/a&gt; the best budget stylus phone feels a bit like a backhanded compliment. There’s more or less just one other contender for that title, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301223/lg-stylo-6-review"&gt;the LG Stylo 6&lt;/a&gt;, which is too underpowered to recommend. But the G Stylus doesn’t just win by default; it’s actually a well-rounded and capable phone for under $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrJn6O"&gt;It offers a big 6.8-inch 1080p screen, a generous 128GB of built-in storage, and a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM. Motorola &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218732/motorola-moto-g-stylus-power-play-2021-one-5g-ace-specs-price-release-date-budget"&gt;introduced it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; with a $299 MSRP, though it’s now selling for $279 from the manufacturer and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERktRf"&gt;Other highlights include a 48-megapixel main camera accompanied by ultrawide and macro rear cameras, a 4,000mAh battery, a “water-repellant” design, and a fingerprint sensor embedded in the recessed power button. It’s a well-rounded set of features for a budget device, even without considering the G Stylus’ headline feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1CMXfG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10372411"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMwyscYsaBk45_Mxu3BlvMy9hSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336738/ajohnson_210228_4453_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus includes apps for note-taking, doodling, and coloring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A24AIo"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) stylus features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Jio0dS"&gt;The main selling point is definitely the G Stylus’ stylus, so let’s cover that first. Like the Stylo 6, the G Stylus includes a built-in capacitive stylus tucked into the bottom-right corner of the device. Popping it out brings up a quick menu of shortcuts to stylus-friendly apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twmfhO"&gt;There’s a note-taking app and a shortcut to take and annotate a screenshot. You can also jot down a quick note without unlocking the screen. It’s a basic set of features — nothing too advanced like what the Galaxy Note series offers — but with a couple of neat bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GbZ0AIeUWlcJoEYrQ0CqKKtx11s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343035/Screenshot_20210301_163539_resized.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With AI, the phone can recognize what you’re trying to draw and turn it into a coloring book template.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i26b5z"&gt;First, messaging apps support handwriting-to-text conversion. This is a Gboard setting you can enable on any Android device, but it’s available by default on the G Stylus. Pressing the “globe” icon to the left of the spacebar opens up the handwriting panel. Write your message, and watch it appear in the text line above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEE9d9"&gt;The Moto G Stylus’ other trick is the ability to create cinemagraphs, still images with a moving element. To create one, you’ll basically take a short video clip, holding the camera still. Then you use the stylus to draw on the areas of the scene with motion. The rest will remain frozen as a still image. You don’t necessarily need a stylus for this, but the added precision is helpful. Results can be saved as an MP4 or a GIF. The app does a decent job of stabilizing a handheld image for a more convincing final product, though the resulting clip is fairly low-res. Still, it’s fun to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2wzF4"&gt;While the LG Stylo 6’s stylus features felt a little more fun and creativity-focused, the Moto G is a little more no-nonsense. Sure, there’s a coloring book app that does a neat trick of using AI to identify a rudimentary sketch of a cat and turn it into a template for your digital “crayons.” But where’s the animated GIF creator? Or an app that records as you sketch so you can text your friends and show off your mad doodling skills? These things exist in third-party apps, no doubt. But the native feature set feels, for better or worse, a little more grown-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jy_YBGfEcsjz-eNJ2sdY4-5mBxg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336740/ajohnson_210228_4453_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus features a big 6.8-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NH82aJ"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nyPqnf"&gt;The Stylus’ screen is nothing fancy — standard 60Hz refresh rate LCD — but it’s a decently bright and large 6.8-inch 1080p display. The phone itself is, naturally, also large and on the heavier side, but the slightly rounded edges of its back panel make it more comfortable to hold than its dimensions suggest. It looks a little ridiculous peeking out of the top of a yoga pants pocket, but this stylus-packing device was never meant to be ultra pocketable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GsK6T"&gt;The G Stylus uses a Snapdragon 678 processor with 4GB of RAM, and this combination feels more than adequate for day-to-day tasks. Apps load quickly, and jumping between them feels snappy. There are some occasional hiccups and slight slowdowns when scrolling through media-rich apps like Twitter, but nothing that feels too frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Y8eANu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I had no problem getting through a full day with plenty of battery life left to spare&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spyXqe"&gt;Battery life is also good — not outstanding but thoroughly sufficient. Motorola claims the Stylus will get two days to a single charge, which feels like a little bit of a stretch in my experience. More importantly, I had no problem getting through a full day, including two-plus hours of screen time, with plenty of battery life left to spare. Motorola includes a 10W charger, which it calls “Turbo Power” when it’s connected. Charging speeds are more average than “Turbo”: 10 minutes of charge got me an extra 10 percent, and it took about 40 minutes total to bring an 80 percent battery up to full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3Sirp"&gt;The Moto G Stylus ships with Android 10 and is expected to get an update to Android 11. Motorola doesn’t say exactly when, but G Stylus owners can keep an eye on the &lt;a href="https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/software-upgrade/g_id/1949"&gt;company’s software update page&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Motorola’s budget device support isn’t great; the phone will get just two years of security updates, ending in January 2023. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that even its budget A-series Galaxy phones will now be guaranteed four years of security updates. Hopefully, that’s a policy more manufacturers like Motorola will consider adopting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3eiDKGk5p3t3cGZ7uL5br-M_hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336741/ajohnson_210228_4453_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stylus includes standard wide, ultrawide, and macro rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DkYomP"&gt;Moto G Stylus (2021) camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dk909J"&gt;The triple camera on the G Stylus is the same found on the $400-ish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22255202/motorola-one-5g-ace-review"&gt;Motorola One 5G Ace&lt;/a&gt;, with the addition of a dedicated depth sensor. To recap, that includes a 48-megapixel f/1.7 main camera that produces 12-megapixel images, an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 2-megapixel macro camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DV5N2C"&gt;There are no surprises here. Like the Ace, the G Stylus is capable of good-quality images in bright light, particularly from the main camera. Downsampling from 48 megapixels to 12 allows it to capture plenty of detail, but if you look close, you’ll see some crunchy-looking sharpening. Colors are reproduced well, without looking overly saturated. As an exception, the camera seems to boost saturation and warmth when it identifies a subject as food. The results are more appetizing, if a little unnatural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y0nxv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10372367"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NNoFvO"&gt;Unfortunately, the ultrawide camera is less good. Even photos taken in bright light show smeary details and some ugly noise. A photo I took of a city street has an unusual purple tint, while a photo from the main camera in the same spot looks much better. This is all evident even at smaller image sizes for social sharing, which is unfortunate. The macro camera is bad, but the selfie camera is a little sharper and better than expected from a budget phone. Win some, lose some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP1sSz"&gt;While the camera system on the Ace was a bit of a letdown, it feels about right on the less expensive Moto G Stylus. You won’t find an amazing night mode or top-notch picture quality here, but for a sub-$300 phone, it does the job just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G Stylus is a well-rounded budget device, even if you don’t care about its pen-focused features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qbxBxO"&gt;The Moto G Stylus is a well-rounded budget phone that also happens to have a stylus. Of Motorola’s 2021 budget devices that I’ve tested so far, this one offers the best balance of features and cost-saving measures. It has a big display, stylus features, good battery life, and solid everyday performance. The cameras, though flawed, are good enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NvcBBw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8UcUv"&gt;This is the obvious choice for someone looking for a budget stylus phone, but I hesitate to recommend it to everyone else. The $299 OnePlus Nord N10 5G offers a faster refresh rate screen, a better camera, and slightly better performance for nearly the same price. If you can afford to spend a bit more, the $349 Google Pixel 4A will offer better software support and a great camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="X1RZZp"&gt;If you’re a stylus devotee or even just strongly stylus-curious, the Moto G Stylus is a good choice. But if you’re ambivalent toward the stylus, you might be better off with one of these other options.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>San Diego Comic-Con, E3, and Anime Expo cancel geek gatherings for the second year in a row</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nGqeAOe2wA9Nu4_RJp2WNVBJTfc=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68893583/sdcc_stock31_1020.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4J9Zo"&gt;San Diego Comic-Con &lt;a href="https://www.comic-con.org/cci"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; this year’s show will not go on, at least not in person, and the 2021 Anime Expo has &lt;a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/2021/03/03/anime-expo-2021/"&gt;now officially canceled&lt;/a&gt; its physical event as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cp58dC"&gt;That’s the second time in 50 years — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225299/san-diego-comic-con-canceled-dates-july-2021-refunds"&gt;the first was last year&lt;/a&gt; — that Comic-Con has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There’ll still be a virtual event from July 23rd to the 25th, and organizers are planning a three-day in-person convention tentatively set for November, but they’re clear that the full shebang has been postponed until 2022 — and offering refunds and rollovers as appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uQNN3a"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7jJid"&gt;They’re not the only California geek gatherings that aren’t going to happen: the Los Angeles Department of Convention and Tourism &lt;a href="https://ens.lacity.org/lacc/laccdcagendas/lacclaccdcagendas250148287_03032021.pdf"&gt;has filed documents (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; that show that the biggest US video game show — E3, aka the Electronic Entertainment Expo — has also ditched its in-person gathering (via &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/e3-2021-as-live-event-cancelled-going-forward-as-digital-working-on-broadcast-options-at-la-live-lacc.385877/#post-59678096"&gt;ResetEra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/e3-2021s-live-show-has-been-cancelled-according-to-la-t-1846373286"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O9X-pFh7WobSNCNfssIvNvlVRyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337636/e3_anime_expo.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LODzQy"&gt;E3 typically draws upwards of 60,000 attendees while Anime Expo can attract over 100,000, so they’re big losses for tourism that the city will be seriously discussing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4j2KW"&gt;Mind you, the Entertainment Software Association that runs E3 already hinted that it would be “transforming” its showcase, so a virtual event wouldn’t be much of a surprise. Anime Expo held &lt;a href="https://www.anime-expo.org/2020/07/14/anime-expo-lite-livestream-event-draws-500000-views-around-world-celebrate-japanese-pop-culture/"&gt;a successful virtual event last year&lt;/a&gt; that drew 500,000 viewers dubbed Anime Expo Lite, and organizers will try that once more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MhlI3B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We will not have a physical event for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AX2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AX2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimeExpoLite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimeExpoLite&lt;/a&gt; will return on July 4th weekend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read the update on our website → &lt;a href="https://t.co/MQdTt7oUtT"&gt;https://t.co/MQdTt7oUtT&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/FGvgZVzMhZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FGvgZVzMhZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anime Expo (@AnimeExpo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnimeExpo/status/1367203282872004609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm3wlC"&gt;E3 has not technically confirmed that their events won’t be happening in-person yet, but the city would know. An ESA spokesperson would only reaffirm that they’re “transforming” E3, and that “we’ll have official details very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LUkeF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 3rd, 3:17PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anime Expo has now confirmed its in-person event has been canceled, for the second year in a row. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arizona advances bill forcing Apple and Google to allow Fortnite-style alternative payment options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TWEgfW8HMIiY9WkmROupVEYvJps=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68905040/bfarsace_201106_4269_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4YCz23"&gt;The Arizona House of Representatives just passed landmark app store legislation in a 31-29 vote on Wednesday that could have far-reaching consequences for Apple and Google and their respective mobile operating systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwGZtT"&gt;The legislation, a &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;sweeping amendment to Arizona’s existing HB2005&lt;/a&gt;, prevents app store operators from forcing a developer based in the state to use a preferred payment system, putting up a significant roadblock to Apple and Google’s ability to collect commissions on in-app purchases and app sales. It will now head to the state senate, where it must pass before its sent to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDD94Y"&gt;The amendment specifically prohibits stores exceeding 1 million downloads from requiring “a developer that is domiciled in this state to use a particular in-application payments system as the exclusive mode of accretive payments from a user.” It also covers users living in Arizona from having to pay for apps using exclusive payment systems, though it’s not immediately clear if that means developers outside Arizona can avoid paying commission to Apple and Google when they sell something to a state resident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPkq8S"&gt;The bill specifically exempts game consoles “and other special-purpose devices that are connected to the internet,” and it also bars companies like Apple and Google from retaliating against developers who choose to use third-party payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yZst2P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bill opens the door to alternative payment systems on iOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo2fXl"&gt;The amendment narrowly passed the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week in a 7-6 vote, which sent it to the floor of the state’s House of Representatives for a full vote on Wednesday. Notable opponents of the bill have been Arizona Democrats, who’ve argued that state legislatures shouldn’t get involved in ongoing legal matters between companies, in reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; between Apple and Google and companies like &lt;em&gt;Forntite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games. There was also concern the bill would interfere with interstate commerce and raise unconstitutionality claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQuEBI"&gt;The bill opens the door to developers using third-party payment systems, thereby allowing them to bypass the industry standard 30 percent cut Apple and Google have collected for years. It’s not clear how the tech companies will respond, as the bill could have significant effects on their businesses in the state of Arizona while also putting pressure on them to change the rules for all developers everywhere. Both Apple and Google declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6jqkl"&gt;“Today, Arizona put a marker down and became the first state in the nation to advance a digital market that is free and fair,” said the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), the industry group composed of Epic, Tinder parent company company Match Group, and Spotify that is responsible for helping draft the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySd8Ae"&gt;“The Coalition for App Fairness is pleased to see the House passage of HB 2005, which will encourage business innovation in Arizona and protect consumer choice. While this is cause for celebration, it is only a first step toward achieving a truly level playing field for all,” the statement goes on to say. “We look forward to working with the Arizona State Senate to move a solution forward that builds on this momentum to provide consumer freedom, lower costs, and increase developers’ ability to thrive and innovate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oco2KR"&gt;The bill has attracted intense lobbying from Apple and Google. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/apple-google-lobbyists-arizona-bill"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;published earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, Apple tapped lobbyist Rod Diridon and also hired Kirk Adams, the former chief of staff to Arizona’s governor, to help make its case to the House of Representatives. Apple also joined the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and pushed the body to begin combating the bill, &lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;reported. “We went through a very difficult weekend where Apple and Google hired probably almost every lobbyist in town,” Arizona State Rep. Regina Cobb, a Republican and the primary sponsor of the bill, told&lt;em&gt; Protocol&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULD3Hv"&gt;In testimony in front of the House, Apple’s chief compliance officer, Kyle Andeer, made the case that the App Store provides value to developers that warrant its commission. “The commission has been described by some special interests as a ‘payment processing fee’—as if Apple is just swiping a credit card. That’s terribly misleading. Apple provides developers an enormous amount of value — both the store to distribute their apps around the world and the studio to create them. That is what the commission reflects,” Andeer said in written testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd59ZZ"&gt;“Yet this bill tells Apple that it cannot use its own check-out lane (and collect a commission) in the store we built,” he goes on. “This would allow billion-dollar developers to take all of the App Store’s value for free — even if they’re selling digital goods, even if they’re making millions or even billions of dollars doing it. The bill is a government mandate that Apple give away the App Store.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcWRtn"&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone. Because of that, for any app that offers digital services like games or music, you have to pay through Apple or Google’s monopolistic payment processing system,” Cobb wrote in an &lt;a href="https://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2021/02/19/its-time-to-free-ourselves-from-big-tech-monopoly/"&gt;op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Arizona Capitol Times&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “You have to use their system and their payment processor, and then they tax you for it. Small app developers have to absorb the cost and struggle to survive or pass the tax onto their consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4X4AfZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple and Google have a monopoly on how you download apps to your phone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxcyR5"&gt;The sentiment is one shared by vocal critics of Apple and Google, like Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson. He has submitted testimony for two bills — this one in Arizona and another in North Dakota — in support of legislation to break up what he sees as monopolies on software distribution, and he’s waged an impassioned campaign against Apple in particular since last summer, when the iPhone maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;engaged in a dispute with Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; over its new Hey email application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XrU4T"&gt;“Apple operates a tollbooth on the only road to distribution of mobile software for the dominant iPhone platform. And this doesn’t just hurt app developers, but consumers as well. When Apple tried to shake down our company for the 30% cut of revenues, they explicitly encouraged us simply to pass on the cost to consumers. And that’s exactly what other developers have done,” Hansson wrote in testimony to the Arizona House Appropriations Committee last week. He added that the bill “would not only provide immediate relief to Arizona developers and consumers, it would instantly make the state the most desirable place on earth to start a new software company.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvANiS"&gt;The bill is one of many — including ones in Georgia, Hawaii, and Minnesota, as well as one that already failed in the North Dakota state senate — making their way through local legislatures. The multistate push can be drawn back to a national lobbying effort from the CAF. The industry group consists of not only Epic, Match, and Spotify, but also dozens of other companies dissatisfied with the rules imposed by Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store. Epic is also engaged in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against both Apple and Google over the removal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;last summer, a dispute that sits at the heart of the ongoing app store debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3CIISd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The bills are part of a multistate lobbying effort from the Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBPaKu"&gt;The CAF, which worked alongside Match to approach Cobb for HB2005, has been hiring lobbyists around the country to approach representatives with draft bills that would make it easier for developers to bypass rules thought to be ironclad within the mobile app world. Specifically for Apple, these bills are targeting rules dictating that iOS users and the platform’s developers only buy, sell, and distribute software through the App Store. (Google allows alternative app stores on Android, though it does present security warnings and other obstacles to users who download and use them.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNk0wf"&gt;Additionally, these bills are taking aim at rules saying app makers must use the preferred payment systems of Apple and Google, as a backup defense in the event alternative app stores remain off the table. It’s those terms, written into developer agreements the companies make app makers sign to distribute software through the stores, that allow both companies to take anywhere from 15 to 30 percent of all revenue generated from digital goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir14ht"&gt;The Arizona bill follows a similar, though broader and potentially more disruptive bill in North Dakota that last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to pass the state’s senate&lt;/a&gt;. The North Dakota bill would have forced Apple and Google to allow alternative app stores onto iOS and Android, in addition to allowing developers to use alternative payment systems. The North Dakota bill, which failed in an 11-36 vote, would have also barred companies from retaliating against developers that opted to use alternative app stores or payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj1Erq"&gt;Apple similarly lobbied hard against the North Dakota bill, with Apple’s chief privacy engineer, Erik Neuenschwander, testifying that the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it.” He further argued that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVDxR"&gt;Central to all of these bills and the fierce lobbying efforts surrounding them from both sides is a debate threatening one of the most lucrative pillars of Apple’s (and to a lesser extent Google’s) business: Should app store owners be able to set the rules for what kind of software is allowed onto mobile phones, and should those rules also force developers into paying commissions for accessing the platform? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdiGX"&gt;Just a few years ago, that Apple and other companies would take 30 percent of all revenue was considered a settled matter. While some companies, like Netflix and Spotify, complained vigorously about unfair treatment, Apple’s iron grip on the App Store, and by extension the iPhone, felt inexorable. It was simply how mobile app distribution worked — unless you were a large company like Amazon, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;cut special deals with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8Xx9F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuqfA"&gt;But growing resentment from developers large and small, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301453/antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-reform-cicilline-buck"&gt;an upswell in regulatory fervor in Washington&lt;/a&gt;, and growing consumer hostility toward Big Tech have created an unprecedented movement hoping to rein in Silicon Valley’s most powerful corporations. Square in the sights of all these parties is the App Store — specifically the 30 percent cut, or “Apple tax” as it has come to be known, and the payment system requirements that help enforce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUSoVB"&gt;Apple has already made some concessions in its relationship to developers in response to rising antitrust pressure. Most prominently, the company announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;new small business program late last year&lt;/a&gt; allowing developers making less than $1 million in annual revenue to lower the App Store cut they pay to Apple from 30 percent to 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLbUvg"&gt;But those concessions are far from stopping Apple’s critics, nor the lobbying efforts of its most committed opponents, from pushing for more. “Apple already has an incredible advantage over any company that dares compete with them, and soon that might well be most of the economy,” Hansson wrote in the conclusion of his HB2005 testimony. “Giving us at least a fighting chance by enforcing a choice in payment processing is the right thing to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6B1z3"&gt;Following the bill’s passing, Hansson said his company Basecamp was fully prepared to relocate to Arizona to take advantage of the perks. “This means everything,” he wrote on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wljdkv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are going to prepare app updates for both Android and iOS that give Arizonans the right to signup for service using our normal payment processing setup. Then start the conversation with lawyers on what it’ll take to relocate Basecamp to Arizona. This means everything.&lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1367197326041903106?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKT1ur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 2nd, 2:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional comment from David Heinemeier Hansson regarding his company’s response to the successful HB2005 vote. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQddZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 2nd, 3PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted that Apple declined to comment. Included public testimony from Apple’s chief compliance officer Kyle Andeer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
