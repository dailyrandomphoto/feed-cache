    <title>COVID-19 vaccines are starting to work in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-pandemic-vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XY3U8yKH_7paxTgdECp1_-OGrts=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843276/1230250214.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DIv2s7"&gt;If you know where to look, you can see COVID-19 vaccines starting to save lives in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tx1ynf"&gt;It’s not in the overall case numbers, though those &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been steadily dropping across the United States for weeks. Epidemiologists say there could be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1362100680492601350"&gt;a few reasons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/02/why-covid-19-cases-are-falling-so-fast/618041/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; that decline: we’re past the holiday seasons surge and people changed their behavior in response to the winter spikes. And by now, many people have antibodies against the virus because of a previous infection. But vaccines probably aren’t a driving factor in that drop — not enough people had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 when the decline started, and vaccination rates are still relatively low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZnMZk"&gt;Some groups of people, though, have high enough rates of vaccination that the benefits are starting to show. Connecticut was one of the first states to finish vaccinations in long-term care facilities and nursing homes. All residents who wanted a vaccine got their first dose by January 8th, and most were fully vaccinated by the end of January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvCqdF"&gt;The impact was &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-cases-covid-20210204-m6mwvhuguzfphpbv2bcwfqtq4m-story.html"&gt;dramatic&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of 2020, around 400 nursing home residents in Connecticut&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;were testing positive each week, and around 100 were dying. In the week ending February 2nd, when most were fully vaccinated, there were 101 cases and 35 deaths — down nearly 80 percent from the month before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPA3zT"&gt;“I have to believe it’s having an impact,” Keith Grant, senior system director for infection prevention at Hartford HealthCare, &lt;a href="https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-nursing-home-deaths-cases-covid-20210204-m6mwvhuguzfphpbv2bcwfqtq4m-story.html"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Hartford Courant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the start of February. At that time, trends were just starting to show declines in nursing home cases and deaths. Since then, things have continued to improve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYBVBg"&gt;Overall case trends in Connecticut are going down as well, which contributes to the decline in nursing homes. But the drop is steeper for that group than for the state as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFazee"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Worth noting that COVID-19 cases have declined significantly across the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the slope has been particularly sharp in nursing homes, where more than 90% of residents are vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nxGvrSxD0l"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nxGvrSxD0l&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Putterman (@AlexPutterman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPutterman/status/1362518746162745348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHiaR9"&gt;Other groups of people in the US, including health care workers and other essential workers, are also starting to be fully vaccinated. The shots are already protecting them, as well. A team of researchers looked at &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.15.21251623v1.full.pdf"&gt;around 30,000 vaccinated people&lt;/a&gt; with health records with the Mayo Clinic Health System, who the researchers noted should mostly be health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities. The rates of COVID-19 in that group started to flatten a few weeks after their first doses, while rates in a group of similar but unvaccinated people continued to climb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pRgl6k"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More promising real-world data on the mRNA vaccines, this time from the USA. Still not tired of seeing gaping chasms in Kaplan-Meier curves&lt;a href="https://t.co/3oRJ6l1cLm"&gt;https://t.co/3oRJ6l1cLm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/s609i5RULl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/s609i5RULl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan Morris (@dylanhmorris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dylanhmorris/status/1362536708013756417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prGM5q"&gt;These victories are still only in subsets of the population. But even though vaccinations may not be driving down overall case numbers quite yet, we could start to see their impacts on hospitalizations and deaths soon. Older adults, who are the most likely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19, are among the first groups getting vaccinated across the country. Higher percentages of that group have received shots than in the population at large. As that number ticks up, hospitalizations could start to fall, even if younger people are still getting sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyNxbY"&gt;Experts point to the 75 to 80 percent threshold as the point when enough people would be vaccinated that the spread of COVID-19 would start to stall out. Still, the vaccines could start flattening overall trends in the US much sooner than that. &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciab079/6124429"&gt;One modeling study&lt;/a&gt; found that if even just 40 percent of the population is vaccinated, cases would fall and hospitalizations and deaths would drop by between 60 and 70 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBhCQw"&gt;That isn’t showing up in the data quite yet, and it’s still critical to stick to the COVID-19 prevention measures that are actually driving the US case numbers down: masks, avoiding gatherings, and so on. But there are flickers of hope from the pockets where most people are vaccinated, and eventually, those will start to expand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C25MrG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s latest hit is an accidental upload from a government office in rural Indiana</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TikToks from the Orange County, Indiana County Clerk’s office" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FJrmCdBPCyYWR81gsOlGwoVNQ6A=/8x0:2033x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843266/Bye_Connie.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Alex Parkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6uiiWb"&gt;A series of accidentally posted office videos has become an unexpected viral hit on TikTok. The most popular shows a series of municipal employees bidding farewell to their colleague, Connie, against the backdrop of a prairie-hued office space straight out of &lt;em&gt;Parks &amp;amp; Rec&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZogBe"&gt;“Congratulations from the Orange County clerk’s office,” says the male deputy clerk, before stepping off to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vwSDxx"&gt;County Clerk Elizabeth Jones steps into the frame: “We wish you the best in your future endeavors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISQZ2a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag9wuJ"&gt;“We appreciate the good job that you have done for the state of Indiana,” says another, before making room for a fourth. “Goodbye, Connie!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6CLEe"&gt;As of press time, more than 40,000 users have liked the video, and it has been viewed more than 300,000 times. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@deputyclerk"&gt;The @deputyclerk account&lt;/a&gt;, which was only launched yesterday, has already amassed nearly 3,000 followers, despite having only eight videos, all of which are variations on the same goodbye message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY4f6I"&gt;The videos have inspired a wave of spinoff content, as users look to put their own spin on the burgeoning meme. In most cases, users take on the role of Connie, imagining themselves to be as loved and appreciated as her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Tla0Jo"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@christynics/video/6930815416541515014" data-video-id="6930815416541515014" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@christynics" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@christynics"&gt;@christynics&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @deputyclerk &lt;a title="iamconnie" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/iamconnie"&gt;#iamconnie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="BoseAllOut" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/BoseAllOut"&gt;#BoseAllOut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="greenscreenvideo" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreenvideo"&gt;#greenscreenvideo&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="driverslicense" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/driverslicense"&gt;#driverslicense&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6930623471508572933"&gt;♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="Oy5XdX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@knockoutkaius/video/6930826324323994885" data-video-id="6930826324323994885" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@knockoutkaius" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@knockoutkaius"&gt;@knockoutkaius&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @deputyclerk I’ll miss my work fam     &lt;a title="froppycosplay" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/froppycosplay"&gt;#froppycosplay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="mhacosplay" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/mhacosplay"&gt;#mhacosplay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6930622731847305989"&gt;♬ original sound - Deputy Clerk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GH2K4p"&gt;
&lt;p id="zZKGL7"&gt;In other cases, users have lip-synced over the audio. “New Trend alert: which voice fits u best,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@elizard_beth/video/6930776801908215046"&gt;asks one such video&lt;/a&gt;. “Charli u have 24 hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAWHON"&gt;The sudden internet fame has been a whirlwind for the clerk’s office, which was not even aware the videos were being posted online. Based in Paoli, Indiana (population 3,677), the clerk’s team is still unsure why the videos have attracted so much attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpoIxY"&gt;“We didn’t know that it was on TikTok,” says Elizabeth Jones, who leads the clerk’s office for Orange County Clerk. “Somehow it got in the for you page, and it got send to a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPqwTW"&gt;“People were like, why did I get this,” Jones continued. “It was really meant just to be her goodbye video.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJh7tq"&gt;The videos begin on Thursday morning, when the office heard news that beloved Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson was retiring. A number of state employees were recording farewell videos for Lawson, and the Orange County office decided to record its version using TikTok to take advantage of the app’s native filter capabilities. But while several clerks were TikTok users, none had ever made a video using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhTbte"&gt;“We all had issues with one or the other so we just did it seven or eight times,” says Deputy Clerk Olivia Griffith, the last woman to speak in the video. “It said ‘save to my device,’ so I thought it was just going to the photo gallery on my phone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3NkyZ"&gt;Many had assumed that the rejected videos would disappear entirely. “The one where I’m singing…that definitely wasn’t supposed to be seen by anybody else,” says Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHQ6Eu"&gt;With 3,000 followers, the office now has a surprising level of TikTok clout, although they’re still undecided on whether they will try to expand on their newfound fame with more videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDfXsu"&gt;“I don’t know,” says Griffith. “We haven’t thought about it. We may.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus went down for some subscribers right when WandaVision’s new episode hit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRI9hz7RlQPDfytfa-1gn8gVszA=/70x0:1690x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843171/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZ0cVw"&gt;Some Disney Plus users trying to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22291176/wandavision-episode-7-explainer-agatha-harkness-agnes-monica-rambeau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the minute it landed were met with loading issues as outage problems affected the streaming platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrRiwS"&gt;A number of accounts mostly located on the West Coast of the United States were affected by a surge in traffic on the platform that caused an outage of roughly 10 minutes, according to the company. Reports about the length of the outage ranged on Twitter, with some people experiencing problems for closer to 30 minutes, leading to trending topics with names like “NOT DISNEY” and “DISNEY+ DOWN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ej0Ybi"&gt;Other reports from people on the East Coast and in the UK also made rounds. Concerns about issues with the specific episode, like encoding problems, are false, according to the company. A screenshot of Down Detector for Disney Plus can be seen below. The outage peaked around 3:05AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KM528ylPE8HzeALPjdsMpVExywA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315198/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_3.35.52_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Down Detector&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of Disney Plus going down, via Down Detector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5SF0mR"&gt;This is not the first time that Disney Plus has faced loading issues. When the service launched, alongside the premiere of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20973340/disney-plus-first-day-outages-app-amazon-bamtech-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s first episode&lt;/a&gt;, reports of Disney Plus not loading circulated social media. Since then, the app has remained mostly fine, with few reports of widespread outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF30Ye"&gt;Other Disney streaming platforms, however, have faced outage issues. Most recently, a number of customers using ESPN Plus to watch UFC 257 faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/24/22247257/espn-plus-technical-issue-ufc-pay-per-view-mcgregor-poirier"&gt;ongoing outage issues&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the main title fight. A Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on January 24th that teams were “aware that a technical issue prevented a portion of users from accessing the early part of the ESPN+ pay-per-view event, and we apologize for that experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmggRI"&gt;“We worked as quickly as possible to identify and resolve the issue,” the spokesperson added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyIjue"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;isn’t the same thing as a Conor McGregor vs. Dustin Poirier fight, the show is one of the most popular series around the world, according to data from Parrot Analytics supplied to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Over the last couple of weeks, the show has become 90.9x as popular (or more in-demand) than the average show globally, analyst Wade Payson-Denney told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It is a top show in 10 different countries on five different continents. So, yes — &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is popular. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihUDwqb4J0x9W60iSRHhCGGx-Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315224/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_11.34.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Parrot Analytics&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4YTc57"&gt;The show has also landed on Nielsen’s most-watched list of streaming originals, seeing millions of streams between the first and second week of the show’s debut. While Nielsen ratings aren’t perfect (they only measure viewership in the United States and don’t count certain methods of watching like on tablets), it goes to show that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s weekly release strategy is working. The first two episodes averaged between 6.5 million and 8.5 million streams, depending on how many people watched the end credits all the way through, according to Nielsen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oUqm5"&gt;This doesn’t fully explain why &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;went down this week and not in other weeks prior, or why &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 finale didn’t cause the streaming platform to stutter. It’s possible Disney ensured that servers were better prepared for the finale because of expected viewership, and it could be that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s weekly viewing at exactly 12AM PT / 3AM ET was unexpected, even by Marvel’s standards. What we do know from the House of Mouse is that it mainly affected West Coast accounts for a short period of time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch BlizzCon 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BlizzCon 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7I-R9yizCKHBuPZuLtqkSmgfYRg=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843008/blizzcon2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PySwen"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271059/blizzcon-2020-canceled-blizzard-entertainment"&gt;canceling BlizzCon 2020 due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard is back — earlier than usual in the year — for BlizzCon 2021. Blizzard is actually calling it “BlizzConline 2021.” Expect to hear updates on anticipated titles, including &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt;, and perhaps a sneak peek at the rumored &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u97fng"&gt;Activision, Blizzard’s parent company, announced during a recent earnings call that both &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t see a 2021 release. And while that’s disappointing, there will likely be some news on games releasing this year. A likely candidate is the &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; game for iOS and Android phones, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;my colleague Andrew Webster got to experience hands-on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e2QmI"&gt;If you want to watch the festivities (which should still be plenty festive even if they won’t be replete with the usual amount of in-person cosplay), here’s how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48AXhs"&gt;When is BlizzCon 2021 happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IBAToo"&gt;BlizzCon will start with the usual opening ceremony at 5PM ET / 2PM PT on Friday, February 19th, and it’s slated to last for an hour and 10 minutes. From then, the convention splits off into five different broadcasts, each focusing on a different game. &lt;a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us/schedule"&gt;Here’s the full schedule&lt;/a&gt;. All broadcasts are scheduled to wrap up by 8:40PM ET / 5:40PM PT. If you’re looking for news on games, it’ll likely happen on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpmEFx"&gt;However, it’ll start up again on Saturday, February 20th, at 3PM ET / 12PM PT. The day two schedule consists of Q&amp;amp;A sessions, community showcases, and additional entertainment, like a &lt;em&gt;Diablo &lt;/em&gt;tabletop campaign hosted by the &lt;em&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt; crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIjr67"&gt;Does it cost anything to attend BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lCUgG5"&gt;Nope. It’s free to attend, unlike previous in-person BlizzCon events that required tickets. If you want some of the goodies that usually came with a ticket, you can buy a BlizzCon bundle of &lt;a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/celebration-collection"&gt;in-game items and cosmetics right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DiN5Ym"&gt;Where can I watch BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BKpSNg"&gt;Blizzard is hosting its online convention at &lt;a href="http://BlizzCon.com"&gt;BlizzCon.com&lt;/a&gt;, or through &lt;a href="http://Battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, Activision Blizzard’s game launcher on desktop and mobile. It’s also going to stream live from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blizzard"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blizzard"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW’s next electric SUV, the ID 5 coupe, will go into production in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNpyltLz_q-SW_ia-mXOYPAmUyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842984/akrales_200915_4161_0361.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDwQl2"&gt;Volkswagen confirmed that its next electric vehicle, the ID 5, will start production in Germany in the second half of 2021. The first pilot series of the ID 5 has already started production, the automaker confirmed in a recent tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJf1sw"&gt;The ID 5 will be a coupe version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21444141/volkswagen-vw-id4-electric-suv-price-range-specs"&gt;the ID 4 compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which went on sale in Europe, China, and North America in late 2020. The ID 4 is the first vehicle built on VW’s modular MEB electric architecture to be available in North America. Its predecessor, the hatchback ID 3, is only being sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5DkR6"&gt;The ID 5 may also fail to reach this side of the Atlantic Ocean, although a VW spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45XwS4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="de" dir="ltr"&gt;Es ist offiziell: Auf den &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; folgt der &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt;! Wie &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VW?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VW&lt;/a&gt;-Markenchef Ralf Brandstätter heute im Gespräch mit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WN_Wolfsburg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WN_Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; bekanntgab, wird das Coupé-SUV bei uns in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zwickau?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Zwickau&lt;/a&gt; gebaut. Markteinführung: 2. Halbjahr 2021! Die ersten Vorserien laufen bereits…  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/c9W5hxnE7E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c9W5hxnE7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vwsachsen_de (@vwsachsen_de) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vwsachsen_de/status/1359873451285184512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YeW2"&gt;A rough translation of that tweet reads, “It’s official: on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; follows the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt; ! As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VW?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VW&lt;/a&gt; -Mark boss Ralf Brandstätter in conversation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WN_Wolfsburg"&gt;@WN_Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; announced, the coupé SUV will be sold in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zwickau?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#Zwickau&lt;/a&gt; built. Market launch: 2nd half of 2021! The first pilot series are already running ...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boooF8"&gt;VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEOAGa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first pilot series are already running”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. The e-Golf was first launched in 2012 but was discontinued in 2020 as the automaker shifts focus to its MEB-built vehicles. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche’s first all-electric sports car, the Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;now six-year-old Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars in order to trick emissions tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBjG5v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="guePeD"&gt;Currently, you can buy the Nintendo Switch Monster Hunter Rise Deluxe Edition for $370 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-deluxe-edition-console%2F-%2FA-82493733%3Fclkid&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The console is bundled with a special-edition Switch, as well as a digital code for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; along with some DLC. Compared to other special edition consoles, this is one of the few Switch bundles that include a game with the console. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qFYuNkpFykDpDolNE5TF7UWkjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315233/switch_monster_hunter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veAGHSQdVpomFEThPomQmjmS1bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070145/jbareham_1492_170228_0275.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $40&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yrravQwglpzWOC1tZVT479bwzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8028811/jbareham_170221_1475_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmgu8T"&gt;If you are looking to use your Nintendo Switch to also g&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSd3ZJ"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our chat show to discuss this week in tech news featuring our reporters and editors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="k0XhRp"&gt;Here’s what the show covered on this episode: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpPx4C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with Adi Robertson and Casey Newton about &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms"&gt;Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s new regulation for news media on the internet.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5ncyC5"&gt;On the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Chris Welch and reporter Julia Alexander return to discuss with Nilay the state of TV and streaming — there’s a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;you can play Apple TV on the latest Google Chromecast now&lt;/a&gt;, and streaming services are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287816/hbo-max-kids-content-shows-competitors"&gt;amping up their content&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision’s seventh episode answers two big questions but introduces many more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pH3qJfmXC1pXV4uQmazOXrKMyr8=/72x0:1422x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842711/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_4.00.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AHRzHJ"&gt;Let’s cut to the chase: a couple of really big things happened on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/998747/9358?subId1=WandaVisionSeventhEpisode021921&amp;amp;sharedid=Verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fwandavision%2F4SrN28ZjDLwH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIpekI"&gt;Most of it is still in line with &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s current strategy of setting up the Big Reveal, whatever that may be. It could be the heavily teased unnamed character likely to appear in the final two episodes. It could be setting up several films and TV shows within the Marvel Cinematic Universe that fans are eagerly awaiting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20702391/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-x-men-mutants-fantastic-four-captain-marvel-2-black-panther"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It could be setting up entirely new rosters of superheroes that have yet to grace the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdWXCd"&gt;At its core, the seventh episode was also about acceptance. That’s a pretty key idea to several of Wanda’s spanning arcs in the comics, so let’s not just glance over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cNlcn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right, here’s your warning. We’re going to get into the nitty-gritty of this episode, so reader beware: you’re in for some spoilers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXwoHMep9WTEplGhklzU42qA89o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314861/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.30.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GymrRv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was Agatha all along!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1zaMT7"&gt;Easily the most shared theory throughout the Marvel fandom became fact with this episode. Wanda and Vision’s strange neighbor, Agnes, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243271/wandavision-episode-3-recap-explainer-mephisto-agatha-harkness-tommy-billy-sword"&gt;actually Agatha Harkness&lt;/a&gt;. In the comics, Harkness plays two vital roles: she’s the protector of Franklin Richards, the son of Fantastic Four members Sue and Reed Richards, but more importantly, she’s the witch who helps Wanda learn how to use her chaos magic powers. More specifically, it’s Agatha who helps Wanda understand that her kids aren’t real, erasing her memory to save her from the pain of realizing her loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3dzuB"&gt;We get a glimpse of how &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;has incorporated some of that relationship in the seventh episode. After Wanda makes her way into Agatha’s basement (the grim interior lined with massive vines and decorative skulls seems directly inspired by Agatha’s residence on &lt;a href="https://headhuntersholosuite.fandom.com/wiki/Whisper_Hill"&gt;Whisper Hill in the comics&lt;/a&gt;), Agatha pops out and proclaims she’s the person running the show. We see wisps of purple magic radiate from the witch, as Agatha takes over Wanda’s brain once again. Remember when Wanda played with the minds of several Avengers in &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron &lt;/em&gt;(except Hawkeye, who dealt with his own mind control problems after an encounter with Loki in &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;)? Sucks to be on the receiving end of it, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqjSou"&gt;This leads to the biggest mystery still surrounding Agatha in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;: friend or foe? She’s an ally in the comics, a mentor to Wanda, but the most recent episode seems to set her up as the show’s big villain. After all, she’s the person who apparently controlled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;Pietro when he came back to life&lt;/a&gt; just to keep the charade going and is directing every one of Wanda’s moves within the hex. Except this is Marvel Studios, and nothing is ever that simple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqXl0Cav4cDwp1kJRr6P-u2SOGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314864/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.31.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I8KFNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The devil’s in the details &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro5t4w"&gt;One of the more curious clues in this never-ending riddle is an ominous-looking book sitting in Agatha’s basement. Like Agatha and Wanda, it radiates magic. Orange and red magic pulses around the book, which is different from Wanda’s striking red chaos magic and Agatha’s purple strain. There’s no obvious answer as to what the text is, but there are a few theories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dWDK9"&gt;The first ties into an ongoing theory we’ve had since the show’s very first two episodes — it’s the devil Mephisto at work. While Mephisto doesn’t have a direct connection to the book, he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a direct connection to both Wanda and Doctor Strange, who may have a direct connection to said book. Mephisto is the one who absorbs Wanda’s children, Tommy and Billy, and it’s because of his actions that Agatha works to wipe Wanda’s mind. (Tommy and Billy eventually come back as two superheroes named Wiccan and Speed as part of the Young Avengers, but more on that in a second.) In one comic arc from the 1970s, Mephisto also attempts to steal some of Doctor Strange’s books to lure the sorcerer and protector of Earth to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6HBUA"&gt;(There’s also that whole thing about Mephisto first &lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mephisto_(Earth-616)#cite_note-16-16-46"&gt;appearing as a fly&lt;/a&gt;, like the one that Wanda sees on Agatha’s curtains.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPJp8K"&gt;By this point, you may be asking, “Why does that matter?” Well, one of the theories is that the strange book is made up of dark matter, which exists in the Doctor Strange universe. As it presents a threat to Earth’s citizens and as Doctor Strange still exists as the Sorcerer Supreme, it’s his job to fight threats from magical or mystical beings. A book made up of dark matter and potentially harnessing secrets of dangerous ancient spells, possibly being used to either summon Mephisto or use his powers, would certainly fall under Doctor Strange’s purview. Since we already know that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;plays into &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, &lt;/em&gt;this is one way to go about it. Also, here’s a quick screenshot from the episode that features a devil caricature etched into Agatha’s house. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jujxBR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the mephisto tease… insane &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WandaVision?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WandaVision&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/kgKWjJYxXV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kgKWjJYxXV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— kian (@maximoffles) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maximoffles/status/1362684618735030273?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmng6f"&gt;The other theory I’ve seen floating around — one that makes less sense to me — is that said book is actually the &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Darkhold#cite_note-1"&gt;Darkhold from &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Look, anything is possible. The Darkhold is a supernatural text that contains ancient and nefarious curses, making its appearance and use by Agatha certainly a possibility. Plus, &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. &lt;/em&gt;has interwoven with the MCU in the past. I just can’t see the reasoning for bringing a book with heavy &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D &lt;/em&gt;ties into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe as it stands at this point in time, but I’m willing to be proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjQKqD"&gt;So if it is Mephisto, the bigger question is whether his role is unique to &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;and as a character that sets up a larger cosmic universe that &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, The Eternals, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;will explore, or something even bigger? Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;and bigger things, let’s address the other massive reveal in this week’s episode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BvH2MuULpVTYx0DMEZQmaMEmTDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314868/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.33.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ff6LXd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome, Spectrum! (Or maybe Photon, Pulsar, or... Captain Marvel?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EpvAFv"&gt;Monica! Freaking! Rambeau! Easily the character with one of the best on-screen superhero introduction moments, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;finally gave us our first look at Monica’s extraordinary new identity. We just have to figure out which identity it is. Buckle up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JYiSD"&gt;It should come as no surprise to comic readers that Monica Rambeau finally took on her role as a superhero. In the comics, she actually portrays a version of Captain Marvel for a period of time within the Avengers before taking on the name more commonly associated with her character, Spectrum. The rebranding is important for a couple of reasons, but one in particular is that it effectively coincides with Thanos’ attack on Earth in the comics. With many of the Avengers up in space, Spectrum was one of the few based in New York left to fight one of the Mad Titan’s children, Proxima Midnight. As part of the Mighty Avengers, Spectrum teams up with Blue Marvel (otherwise known as Adam Brashear) who saves her life after she’s poisoned by Midnight Proxima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3ROnb"&gt;This is a lot of back detail for an event that already happened and played out differently (as far as we know) in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but Adam Brashear’s name might sound familiar to the avid theorists. Adam Brashear is a superhero, but he’s also an engineer and theoretical physicist who has some expertise working with aerospace equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPknDx"&gt;When Monica suggested she knew the perfect aerospace engineer who could help with solving the energy force shielding the Hex, people naturally assumed it was Reed Richards. Instead, Monica initially revealed it to be a character named Major Goodner. Much like Agatha Harkness and the feeling that something else is just around the corner, I don’t think it ends with Major Goodner. I also don’t think it’s likely that Reed Richards will pop up in a finale of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, although — like the Darkforce situation — anything is possible. Considering Monica Rambeau and Adam Brashear end up as a couple, and he’s an aerospace engineer who can work with energy forces, I’m waiting to see him appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sAHwIP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Monica! Freaking! Rambeau!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUB3GB"&gt;If anything, at least that will let us know Monica is Spectrum — maybe. It does, however, set up a role for Monica Rambeau in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, Monica has a complicated relationship with Carol Danvers, a person she looked up to as the wickedly cool aunt in the first &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;. With new extraordinary powers, a desire to defend the world from existential threats, and a personal connection to Captain Marvel that is ready to be explored, expect more from Spectrum in the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Ia2H"&gt;Speaking of cool superhero team-ups I want to see, the more we see of Tommy and Billy’s powers, the more excited I am for what &lt;em&gt;seems to be &lt;/em&gt;an inevitable Young Avengers arc. Speed and Wiccan are making their way in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167550/hawkeye-premiere-date-marvel-disney-plus-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld-wandavision"&gt;introduce Kate Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/falcon-winter-soldier-marvel-comics-patriot-explained/"&gt;rumored to introduce Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, Cassie Lang already exists in the &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man &lt;/em&gt;universe, and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel &lt;/em&gt;is just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmvQi6"&gt;Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige also hasn’t shied away from telling people that Young Avengers will play a &lt;a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/marvels-kevin-feige-admits-studio-is-planting-seeds-for-young-avengers-to-appear-in-mcu"&gt;role in the MCU’s fourth phase&lt;/a&gt;. I’m just excited for my teen superheroes to get their time to shine, however that may be in the end. Give them all a show and then bring them together for a Young Avengers on Disney Plus — like the time Marvel TV gave us &lt;em&gt;Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist &lt;/em&gt;before releasing &lt;em&gt;The Defenders — &lt;/em&gt;but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IWEgYA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A commercial is never just a commercial &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ep0Ztn"&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s most fun traits is the seemingly innocuous but never truly innocent commercials. This week’s commercial focuses on an antidepressant of sorts called Nexus. The pill allows people to remain rooted in reality — or a reality of their choice. The wink-wink to Wanda’s current fictional world aside, Nexus also connects to Marvel’s Nexus beings, a breed of unique and powerful beings that are anchors within the multiverse. They are keystones to everything. In the current Marvel-616 comics continuity storyline, Wanda is one of those Nexus beings. Not only does that make her stability crucial to all of mankind (this is your periodic reminder to read &lt;em&gt;House of M &lt;/em&gt;if you haven’t yet), but it also makes her situation especially important to Doctor Strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmHIa4"&gt;Since we know Marvel Studios is going to greatly explore the multiverse in at least two prominent movies, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;/em&gt;, the commercial suggests that whatever happens with Wanda, Agatha, and whoever else in the final episodes will likely intersect with the events of those films. Remember, this was Marvel Studios and Disney’s vision all along for the version of the MCU that exists on Disney Plus — movies will play into TV shows, and TV shows will play into movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukTTmF"&gt;What’s increasingly obvious is &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/998747/9358?subId1=WandaVisionSeventhEpisode021921&amp;amp;sharedid=Verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fwandavision%2F4SrN28ZjDLwH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;still has a lot of story to tell, even with just two episodes left. The countdown begins until the eighth episode. Only about 160 hours left at the time of this writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkVOT6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends, and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 43 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;In California, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run Massachusetts site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There is also a site that aggregates the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. And &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nhHjOx"&gt;By the way, if you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reservation Of The Anticovid Vaccine For Over Eighty In Apulian Pharmacies" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4leCSmB_jTd6jhw7V_SvQQsfQ8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299704/1231117569.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Davide Pischettola / NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, because of low supplies of vaccine, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1K6i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 10:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include a mention of webpage change monitoring tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jkqbm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 11AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include another Massachusetts site and two general vaccination finding sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQk0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MrQqON"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular titles on the Nintendo Switch right now. But if you’re interested in experiencing one of Nintendo’s popular franchises in other media forms, an official manga based on the latest entry is getting an English translation this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0oH8Q"&gt;Viz Media announced that the first volume, titled &lt;em&gt;Deserted Island Diary,&lt;/em&gt; will release in the West on September 14th. The manga will focus on what the villagers residing on a deserted island are up to. The manga was originally released in Japan in 2020 and currently has &lt;a href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/books/volume/49514"&gt;two volumes&lt;/a&gt; available. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; also inspired &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7MLd2fJfcs"&gt;a separate manga series&lt;/a&gt;, with the first chapter debuting in the February 2020 issue of &lt;em&gt;Ciao&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wZ77v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This year is important for the ‘Animal Crossing’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series as the original game celebrates its 20th anniversary&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zot7m8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to the manga form, as previous games in the series like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FJAPAN-manga-LOT-Animal-Crossing-New-Leaf-Tobidase-Doubutsu-no-Mori-vol-1-2-%2F313065605706&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289384%2Fanimal-crossing-manga-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FAnimal-Crossing-manga-Oideyo-Doubutsu-no-Mori-Shiawase-Tsuushin-Japan-Comic-%2F173875876031&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289384%2Fanimal-crossing-manga-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also received manga adaptations. Last year, Nintendo also shared a four-panel comic strip on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1235263744948592640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1235263744948592640%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fcomics%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289463%2Fanimal-crossing-new-horizons-manga-deserted-island-diary"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlLZAg"&gt;This year is important for the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;series, as the original game celebrates its 20th anniversary. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; has always been one of Nintendo’s more popular franchises. Its latest installment, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, has been met with critical acclaim, and the entry has provided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;a sense of escapism&lt;/a&gt; for many players during lockdowns caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;
