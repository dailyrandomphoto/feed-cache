    <title>Twitter is testing a newsletter subscription button on profile pages</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YX1O1b"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371221524189186?s=20"&gt;testing a feature&lt;/a&gt; that makes it even more enticing to use its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;recently acquired Revue newsletter platform&lt;/a&gt;: the ability to subscribe to a newsletter directly from a Twitter profile, without having to follow a link to a separate website. The feature &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/newsletter-subscribe"&gt;can be enabled by all Revue newsletter writers&lt;/a&gt;, but the button is initially only being shown to a test group of Twitter users on Android and the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0lE99"&gt;The subscribe button has to be turned on in Revue’s settings before it can show up on Twitter. Visually, the new button and newsletter card appear underneath your Twitter bio almost like a pinned tweet, populated with the title of your Revue newsletter, a photo, a short description, and the actual subscribe button. Tapping the button pulls up a dialog box reminding you what you’re getting in to (this person you follow on Twitter will now have your email) and lets you read a sample issue of the newsletter and then subscribe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xc6Ti7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s here  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we’re starting to test a feature that allows people to subscribe to your Revue newsletter directly from your Twitter profile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's available to all Revue creators immediately. To start though, your newsletters will show only for a test group on Twitter. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YDa1aOGeLM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YDa1aOGeLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Revue (@revue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/revue/status/1428371221524189186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DuVGPX"&gt;It’s a super simple feature, but possibly a very meaningful one for someone considering starting a newsletter — or transitioning to Twitter’s platform. While writing a newsletter can theoretically be successfully done by anyone, financially successful newsletters are often written by people with an established writing career, an established following, or both. Twitter’s now made it dramatically easier to convert a following into subscribers with a few taps. That’s a lot less clunky than having a Substack link in your profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qhK0p"&gt;Easy newsletter subscriptions are just the latest offering in Twitter’s rapidly expanding suite of features, several of which are also hosted on the profile page. The company began experimenting with collecting direct payments with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;a Tip Jar feature in May&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also enabled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597576/twitter-shopping-module-pilot-gamestop-arden-cove-brands"&gt;a shopping “carousel”  for select brands&lt;/a&gt; that lets you buy products without leaving Twitter. The profile page is a space often used by creators to link to competing newsletter and subscription products, but if Twitter gets its way, you might never leave its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V2mO7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer Hammerhead True Wireless (2021) review: ANC with a colorful light show</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Razer did the Razer thing and put RGB lighting on its latest earbuds&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KlnqWU"&gt;Razer is suddenly becoming a seasoned earbuds brand: the new $130 Hammerhead earbuds are the company’s third pair of true wireless buds. They follow the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937068/razer-truly-wireless-headphones-hammerhead-bluetooth-5-earbuds-android-gaming-mode-price"&gt;original Hammerheads released in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22272549/razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-pro-review-specs-price"&gt;I reviewed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The latest set is more “Pro” than not in both looks and features: they offer active noise cancellation, a low-latency gaming mode, and have switched to a in-ear design with silicone tips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEX0we"&gt;But these days (and at this price), those features are no longer enough to stand out from a hugely crowded field. So Razer decided to add something to its new earbuds that’s impossible to miss: RGB lighting. Just like many of the company’s laptops and gaming accessories, the 2021 Hammerhead True Wireless include Razer’s full Chroma RGB system, which lets you pick from 16.8 million colors and a variety of flashy effects that shine through the snake logo on each earbud. It makes for what Razer calls “the ultimate wireless earbud flex.” But it’s a flex that only other people will see: it’s not like you’ll ever notice the RGB glow when you’re wearing the earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z8Bcs5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10709325"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0h52yq"&gt;By default when first paired with your phone, the Hammerhead True Wireless buds use a “spectrum” effect that smoothly transitions through a variety of colors. If you want to switch up the lighting, you’ll need to install the Razer Chroma RGB app for Android and iOS — separate from the Razer Audio app that’s used for EQ adjustments and customizing the touch controls. Two apps for a single pair of earbuds? Really? Surely Razer could just replicate the RGB functionality in the main audio app to reduce clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pNE3D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio meter:&lt;/strong&gt; the RGB lighting reacts to the music being played. You can choose to have this effect work with a single color — where it honestly just looks like the light is on the fritz — or rapidly cycle through an endless array of different hues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdgXwx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breathing:&lt;/strong&gt; a slow pulsating effect where the RGB lighting repeatedly brightens and dims. In this mode, you can set two different colors to switch between with each “breath” or have the earbuds pick a different color every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnICIv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spectrum:&lt;/strong&gt; the earbuds smoothly switch between a wide range of different colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bup63"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Static:&lt;/strong&gt; the RGB lighting will stay on whichever color you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bhRxOasBQhockYmATGcrc2rJdzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792489/DSCF4670_Edited_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds now slot into the case vertically, whereas the original Hammerheads laid flat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpsYT"&gt;Out of the box, the lighting is set to 50 percent brightness, which is enough to draw attention — especially if you’re wearing them at night. And let me tell you, those lights will prove very useful should you drop an earbud onto the floor since they’re so easy to spot. Razer says the RGB lighting is optimized for a minimal impact on battery life, but it still takes a toll. With both ANC and the lighting turned off, the Hammerhead True Wireless can hit 6.5 hours of listening time. Using the RGB feature cuts off an entire hour, and the estimate drops to 5.5 hours. Add ANC to the equation and you’re left with only four hours of continuous playback. (With RGB off and ANC enabled, they’ll last up to 4.5 hours.) Those numbers lined up with my experience, and I imagine most people will keep the lights on unless they’re on a long flight or other scenarios where battery life is a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ENoC8RiQow2mxzzdicNVIT-rilo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792450/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_2.52.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RGB lighting does have a detrimental impact on battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KMYXPo"&gt;The Razer Audio app includes equalizer controls: you can pick from presets like “enhanced bass” or “vocal,” but it also gives you full control over the EQ range if you want to adjust every slider to your liking. The app is where you can remap the touch controls, which by default are fairly standard: tap once to play / pause, twice to skip tracks, three times to go back, or press and hold to toggle ANC. But Razer gets a little over-ambitious beyond that. I’m all for customizable controls, but “double tap and hold” is where you start to lose me. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fwh6BfjsUYUNLq7gCVcsor2MX9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792576/app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer audio app includes EQ customization and control remapping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vb1j4W"&gt;Whether it’s user error or imprecise touch sensors, it’s too easy to mess up that gesture and skip to the next song when you didn’t mean to. The earbuds went into pairing mode once or twice when I didn’t get it just right. And by default, that’s how you control volume — something you’ll want to do often! Frustratingly, you can’t assign volume to the simpler hold gesture (or any of the others). There were also times when the touch controls stopped responding until I cased the earbuds and pulled them out again, so Razer has more work to do with firmware updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/554f_oPpcafDrLOsEC5xWpYqKmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792467/DSCF4641_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Depending which RGB mode you choose, the earbuds might be different colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wMKeq8"&gt;Design-wise, the Hammerhead True Wireless are very similar to the company’s pricier Pro model. They’ve got the same overall long-stemmed shape, and their cases are practically identical. (Neither set supports wireless charging.) But there are subtle differences when you look closer: the Pros are more matte, while the lower-cost earbuds are all glossy. Razer includes a deluge of tips with the Pros (including Comply foam tips), but you only get the typical S / M / L trio of silicone options with these. And there’s also a large mic inlet on the Hammerhead Pros for their hybrid ANC, whereas the regular model uses a smaller mic that’s better concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="e4DHYB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10709377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUVrSq"&gt;Like the Pros, the second-gen Hammerhead True Wireless had a solid fit in my ears and felt both lightweight and comfortable. The large tips made for a nice seal and good noise isolation, which helped boost the noise cancellation and made it feel more effective than it otherwise would. Like a lot of earbuds in this price range, Razer will cut out some of the hums and rumbles of everyday life, but they can’t knock out as much of the surrounding world as premium options like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the AirPods Pro. But these earbuds will cancel enough noise to keep you focused on your &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; session at the coffee shop without constant distractions. They’re also rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, making them a feasible option for runs and other workouts. If you’re on an evening jog, having lights in your ears could be yet another visibility measure to help keep you safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Mbuxj5OdJvZId3pvKYdYSwxyzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792478/DSCF4633_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The RGB lighting is quite noticeable even at 50 percent brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6EXDe4"&gt;Gaming mode on the Hammerheads cuts audio latency down to 60ms, which is enough to avoid any sync issues that could quickly pull you out of the action. But when it’s enabled, you’ll need to stay closer to your device than normal for optimal performance; Razer recommends keeping within two feet. The buds have Bluetooth 5.2 and didn’t exhibit any problematic cutouts or other bugs in my time testing them so far. And despite lacking the “THX certification” that the Hammerhead True Wireless Pros have, their sound quality is quite pleasing for the price. They aren’t as detailed or full-bodied as earbuds in the $200-300 tier, and the recent $150 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; outperform them with more dynamic sound. But Razer gave the 10mm drivers a nice, even-handed tuning that spans genres well — and those comprehensive EQ controls always help if you want to tinker. They’re neither brilliant nor bad and are right in that place where $130 earbuds so often land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Am4LTj"&gt;The Razer Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds aren’t going to be a fit for everyone’s taste: I’m perfectly happy with low-key earbuds that don’t emit a light show whenever I’m wearing them. But by adding RGB lights to its latest earbuds, Razer is doing the obvious Razer thing, and it’s a unique trick that might appeal to some of the company’s diehard fans. I’d sooner recommend something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; to people looking for an everyday, under-$150 pair of wireless earbuds. But those won’t get people looking at you quite the same way that these do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loBwqS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Epgge"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP Pavilion Aero 13 review: budget Envy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not your typical HP Pavilion&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8HaF8c"&gt;The Pavilion label on the HP Pavilion Aero 13 is misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CStvR"&gt;The rule of thumb with HP’s consumer laptops is: Pavilions are cheap, Envys are midrange, Spectres are expensive. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is much nicer (and a bit more expensive) than your typical budget laptop, with plenty of features — like a 16:10 screen, a 10-hour battery life span, and a mind-blowingly light chassis — that are typically reserved for premium Windows devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAfdjf"&gt;While testing this device, I’ve been having flashbacks to my review of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt; last summer. I remarked that it felt a lot more like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; than an Envy, and that many of the Spectre’s best features appeared to have trickled down. The same appears to have happened here. This Pavilion feels like an Envy — and it’s priced like one, with models &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2FConfigureView%3FurlLangId%3D%26catalogId%3D10051%26langId%3D-1%26storeId%3D10151%26catEntryId%3D3074457345619966818%26quantity%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22632318%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $749.99&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-laptop-13-be0097nr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22632318%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999.99 as tested&lt;/a&gt;). It looks like HP has released the first premium Pavilion, and it’s surprisingly great.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iTQhdb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10709242"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uPkufS"&gt;Perhaps the biggest contributor to the Aero’s excellence is its processor. My model has AMD’s eight-core Ryzen 7 5800U, which is one of the fastest U-series processors (the ones in thin and light laptops) you can buy. Models with this processor start at $869.99. It makes the Aero one of the lightest laptops you can buy with eight cores. (My review unit also has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.) The 5800U is positioned to compete with Intel’s flagship Core i7-1165G7 (which is available in the much more expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-spectre-x360-laptop-14t-ea000-touch-1q881av-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22632318%2Fhp-pavilion-aero-13-2021-amd-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;), but it’s proven itself &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-7-5800U-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.510374.0.html"&gt;significantly faster&lt;/a&gt; in multicore performance. The Aero is also available with a six-core Ryzen 5 5600U, which we wouldn’t expect to be a big step down in performance. The entire Ryzen 5000 line is fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki05Zt"&gt;Having raved about the 1165G7-powered Spectre x360 14 not too long ago, I think the Aero was about on par with that machine in everyday use. It blew through my typical workload of around a dozen Chrome tabs with Slacking, Spotify streaming, and Zoom calls over top with no issues. But the battery life — AMD’s true strength — is the real standout here. I averaged 10 hours and 49 minutes of continuous work with the screen around medium brightness. That’s much longer than we saw from last year’s Envy x360 13, and even a bit better than the Spectre x360 14. I also didn’t see any difference in quality on the Battery Saver profile — most people should be fine using that for some extra juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 seen from the right, half open, on a red picnic table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/msWLm_GmmE957RdBWX325wwwxP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785985/mchin_191108_47150006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-A ports have little covers on the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzitOWHeVcUucSASLufsZVEAs70=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785986/mchin_191108_47150007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No privacy shutter or on / off switch for the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="geNm9u"&gt;AMD’s Radeon graphics did a decent job with gaming as well, though the company isn’t as dominant over Intel in this area. I was able to run &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, on native resolution, at an average of 66fps on medium and 52fps on high at the screen’s native resolution, or 80fps and 58fps respectively at 1080p. Those results are fairly comparable to what we saw from last year’s Envy x360 13 with a Ryzen 4000 processor. That’s expected, since there hasn’t been a significant integrated graphics update between those generations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hSzy1"&gt;If you use creative software a lot, though, you may be better served with Intel machines, which take advantage of Intel’s Quick Sync feature for faster encoding and decoding. The Aero took 15 minutes and 44 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second 4K video in Premiere Pro. That’s certainly better than last year’s Envy, which took over an hour, but isn’t a great result among recent machines I’ve used. The past few Core i7 devices we’ve run that test on have completed the task in under nine minutes, and even the ZenBook 13 OLED, powered by the same 5800U processor, was over a minute faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SZpvL9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD’s Radeon graphics did a decent job with gaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ihWnlw"&gt;The Aero also scored a 147 on the Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro, which tests live playback and export performance at 4K and 8K (and the program crashed a few times before I could even get a result). That’s good for a budget laptop (beating, for example, the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=37358"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;), but not exceptional across the board — the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=34801"&gt;Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=16041"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; score better (and it doesn’t approach &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=50554"&gt;Apple’s MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P79Uzc"&gt;The cooling was impressive, though. The Aero’s keyboard never got uncomfortably hot, and I never saw the CPU jump anywhere near concerning temperatures during gaming or benchmark testing. The fans weren’t usually audible, even under heavy loads. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 closed seen from the left on a red picnic table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDd_ykCbbdLJ-IRw5jbXH-stzvA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785987/mchin_191108_47150008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wi-Fi 6 is optional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SEPDaW"&gt;It’s not just the number of cores that makes this laptop exciting — it’s the cores per pound. The Aero 13 HP’s lightest consumer laptop, weighing 2.1 pounds. While that means it’s not the lightest Windows laptop you can buy — as far as I know, that honor still belongs to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22239215/asus-expertbook-b9450-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Asus ExpertBook&lt;/a&gt; — it’s certainly one of the lightest at this price point. I’m used to describing Pavilions as clunky, so that’s a pleasant surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj7lPF"&gt;The downside of the thin frame is that the Aero feels a bit flimsy — which remains a significant differentiator between this device and the very sturdy Envy line. There was noticeable flex in my unit’s screen and across its keyboard deck. On the plus side, the magnesium aluminum chassis didn’t pick up any scratches or fingerprints during my testing period. The hinge is also sturdy, with no screen wobble to be seen, and it’s easy to raise and lower with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmrmhk"&gt;Looks-wise, the Aero is unobtrusive and minimalist. It’s less refined than an Envy, due in part to the plastic bezels around the screen. The silver finish on my test unit is somewhat school-laptop-cart-y, but you can get a few nice-looking hues — pale rose gold, warm gold, and ceramic white — for $20 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qA4vBi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Aero is unobtrusive and minimalist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b4YDjm"&gt;It does have a more modern look than past Pavilions, and part of that is the display. This is HP’s first 13.3-inch laptop with a 16:10 aspect ratio. It has a 90 percent screen-to-body ratio, which is comparable to that of much more premium devices — the Envy x360 has an 88 percent ratio. In other words, the Aero is taller, with smaller bezels, than plenty of more expensive devices, and it provides more vertical screen space without adding much size to the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnbJrK"&gt;The 1920 x 1200 display itself is quite bright, easily surpassing 400 nits at maximum brightness. That makes the Aero’s screen one of the brightest I’ve tested this year. That’s surprising to see on a budget laptop — the Spectre doesn’t even break 300. I could use the device outside in bright sunlight and didn’t see any kind of glare. Colors and contrast were good as well. I would wager this is one of the brightest screens you can get at the Aero’s price point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The HP Pavilion Aero 13 on a red picnic table open, seen from above. The screen displays a black desktop background with a multicolor cloud in the center." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3mZoRLqwnC66HhxPhjJER8ewwB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785988/mchin_191108_47150009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten percent more vertical viewing space than 16:9 models, HP says.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkUZij"&gt;Everything else about the chassis is good, but not quite great. The touchpad — 23 percent larger than the touchpads of previous Pavilions — isn’t my favorite, with a bit of a coarse texture and buttons that require a firm press, but it works. The keyboard is also fine, though backlighting costs $20 extra. It’s fine to type on, but neither as comfortable nor as quiet as the Envy’s keyboard (which is one of my favorites on the market). Like other HP devices, the Aero has a row of hotkeys down the left side including Home, Page Up, Page Down, and End. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66H95c"&gt;There’s no Thunderbolt support — AMD CPU, after all — but you do get two USB Type-A, a USB Type-C, an HDMI, and a headphone / microphone combo jack. It’s convenient to have a USB-A port on each side. The only thing I wish it had was an SD slot, a feature that’s appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375183/hp-pavilion-x360-lte-2020-laptop-review"&gt;older Pavilion models&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CaKnnH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10709254"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V9fN98"&gt;I only hit one real disappointment during my testing period, which was the speakers. The sound quality is not great, and the bass is particularly weak. There was some distortion that wasn’t a huge problem — I could only hear it if I was leaning close to the laptop — but also didn’t go away until the volume was below 50 percent. You can swap between audio presets in Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen’s audio control center for music, movies, and voice, but they didn’t make much of a difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVL4Bz"&gt;And a final note: There’s bloatware. My unit came with all kinds of garbage preinstalled, including multiple McAfee programs, ExpressVPN, and various games. I was getting peppered with popups until I could uninstall everything. While bloatware isn’t as egregious on budget laptops as it is on premium devices (cough cough, Spectre), I’m still frustrated to see it on a device that costs $1,000 (which my unit does). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the HP Pavilion Aero 13 on a red picnic table seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVuX8dPNehQSEwiRjwbbedsdbU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785989/mchin_191108_47150010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’d go for the gold one, myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ2993"&gt;If I were shopping for a device under $800, the base Pavilion Aero 13 is what I’d buy. The main things I see as compromises are the chassis quality, the bad audio, and the lack of backlit keyboard for the base price. If those are issues for you, you can improve upon them for a similar price (depending on discounts) if you go for an Envy instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xCotL1"&gt;But some of the Pavilion’s most exceptional traits — the brightness, the weight, and the battery life — are difficult to beat, even at much higher price points. Despite the Aero’s drawbacks, those things alone make it seem like a no-brainer over budget competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;, which has the same build and audio issues without those standout benefits. And there are plenty of bonus features — the 16:10 screen, the surprisingly quiet fans, and the powerhouse eight-core processor — to ice the cake. All in all, the Pavilion Aero is an appealing package. Despite its moniker, it’s much more Envy than Pavilion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Toyota to reduce production in Japan and North America due to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COVID-19’s Impacts The Automotive Industry" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKcRPUIm_VKxMNIrN1RugevkSFI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748442/1230549913.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Toyota’s supply chain has been disrupted | Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K5Dv2a"&gt;Toyota said Thursday that it would &lt;a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/corporate/35741389.html"&gt;reduce production&lt;/a&gt; in Japan and North America due to a shortage of semiconductor chips, a sign that even the best-run supply chains are being affected by the shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKGkL0"&gt;In Japan, the automaker will reduce production by 40 percent later this month and into September, which will affect most of its production lines, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-succumbs-to-chip-shortage-and-shuts-factories-11629372702"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;; planned reductions in North America will be between 40 and 60 percent in August. The reductions mean Toyota will produce between 60,000 and 90,000 fewer vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1epYY8"&gt;“Due to COVID-19 and unexpected events with our supply chain, Toyota is experiencing additional shortages that will affect production at most of our North American plants,” the company said in a statement. “While the situation remains fluid and complex, our manufacturing and supply chain teams have worked diligently to develop countermeasures to minimize the impact on production.” The company does not expect the disruptions in production to affect staffing levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NG6awS"&gt;“We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused to our customers and suppliers,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xRZbmw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="highcharts-trriauc-0"&gt;Toyota is the latest automaker to alter its production plans because of the semiconductor shortage caused by COVID-19 related slowdowns at chipmakers’ plants. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/vw-says-might-have-cut-production-further-due-chip-shortage-2021-08-19/"&gt;Volkswagen also said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; it may have to cut production because of the chip shortage, and both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/08/gm-cutting-production-at-several-plants-due-to-chip-shortage.html"&gt;Ford and General Motors said&lt;/a&gt; in the spring that they were idling or extending shutdowns at several of their North America plants. Tesla, meanwhile, said in July that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewriting its vehicles’ software&lt;/a&gt; to support alternative chips. But Tesla CEO Elon Musk said during an earnings call that “the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kmf901"&gt;Toyota had been mostly shielded from the chip shortage up to this point; as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;noted in May, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-retreat-from-50-years-of-just-in-time-manufacturing-11620051251?mod=article_inline"&gt;Toyota made adjustments&lt;/a&gt; to its famously efficient supply chain to try to adapt. But with the delta variant of the coronavirus leading to an increase in infections globally, chip production will likely remain slow.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google secretly had a giant gaming vision that includes bringing games to Mac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e0lvTg4_7XY1PRHup94yeOgtro=/0x0:1211x807/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748239/google_gameplan_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaoG72"&gt;Apple’s Mac has long been an afterthought for the video game industry, and few think of Google as a games company — despite running Android, one of the biggest game platforms in the world. But Google had a plan to change those things in October 2020, according to an explicitly confidential 70-page vision document dubbed “Games Futures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RrPgnN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Iraou7"&gt;The “need-to-know” document, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;caught up in the discovery process&lt;/a&gt; when Epic Games hauled Apple into court, reveals a tentative five-year plan to create what Google dubbed “the world’s largest games platform.” Google imagined presenting game developers with a single place they can target gamers across multiple screens including Windows and Mac, as well as smart displays — all tied together by Google services and a “low-cost universal portable game controller” that gamers can pair with any device, even a TV.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZy9GLr6fCUNgghkErs3OX53uB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22791941/google_gameplan_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQrG7E0LzrmFGqhDXNZL7B7op0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22789006/universal_controller_mobile_google.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3OwgTi"&gt;There’s some reason to be skeptical that this document reflects Google’s true direction: “Brought to you by ‘partially funded’ and ‘i have a dream’ productions,’” an early slide reads. And we know that Google lost some of its gaming ambition this February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;when it decided to pull the plug on its original game studios&lt;/a&gt; for Google Stadia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sUaId"&gt;And yet, the heavily redacted document suggests that to start down this path, Google would first bring “emulated, native and streamed games” to Windows, something that no longer sounds far-fetched: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;Microsoft just announced in June that Android apps are coming to Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;, admittedly with Amazon’s Appstore as the initial partner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXm8DU"&gt;If Google is actually going in this direction, you can get a glimpse of what to expect in the full 70-page document embedded below. It includes how Google would try to establish its Play Games brand as an “indie game destination,” bring roughly 100 of “the best of Android mobile games” to PC, require developers to support controllers and multiple platforms, and mandate minimum prices so it can attract “super-premium” games to the platform. There’s a lot that hasn’t been redacted, and it’s ambitious stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AgOw0J"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21044018-2025-2021-google-vision-game-plan-multiplatform/?embed=1&amp;amp;responsive=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="2025-2021-google-vision-game-plan-multiplatform (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="920" style="border: 1px solid #aaa; width: 100%; height: 800px; height: calc(100vh - 100px);" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPcOJB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSimNR"&gt;And if you’d like more where that came from, you can find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;our whole list of the best emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gK6mbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMJaps"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUwYyq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBHoBD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Foundation trailer has some serious ‘Game of Thrones but in space’ energy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htOt2NDjRXJQdtwzpsiCqOGmHiw=/0x32:1828x1251/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69748186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_19_at_8.52.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="miQG7D"&gt;Apple has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4QYV5GTz7c"&gt;a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, its upcoming epic sci-fi show for Apple TV Plus based on Isaac Asimov’s series of novels, and I’m getting some serious “&lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;but in space”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;energy from it. There are vast (space) vistas, a sweeping soundtrack, numerous shots of people making very serious faces, and dramatic proclamations that wouldn’t be out of place in an early episode of &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B82vBj"&gt;“Wars will be endless.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OZiHUh"&gt;“Martyrs tend to have a long half-life.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DRso2D"&gt;“Change is frightening. Especially to those in power.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DDrqms"&gt;And you know what? That’s fine with me. For me, nothing has replicated the excellence of the first few seasons of &lt;em&gt;Game of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Thrones. &lt;/em&gt;Their gripping action, shocking twists, and captivating power struggles made every episode feel important, and I eagerly anticipated each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RovptT"&gt;Based on this trailer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553852/foundation-trailer-apple-tv-plus-premier-date"&gt;and the last one&lt;/a&gt;, Apple seems to be going for a similar vibe with &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;, and I’m looking forward to watching the show for myself to see if it recaptures that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; magic. (If you’re looking for a short explainer about the &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; novels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223728/apple-foundation-trilogy-isaac-asimov-tv-show-david-goyer-josh-friedman"&gt;we’ve got one in this article&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="918P0x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; premieres on Apple TV Plus on September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A natural experiment in Vermont helped show the impacts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="81dPMw"&gt;In late October 2020, the University of Vermont Health Network was hit by a ransomware attack. The system couldn’t access electronic health records for &lt;a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/uvm-health-brings-ehr-back-online-one-month-after-ransomware-attack"&gt;nearly a month&lt;/a&gt;. Every computer at UVM Medical Center was infected with malware. Hospitals in the network &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/cyberattack-uvm-health-network/161059/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy and mammogram appointments, just as COVID-19 cases in the United States started to tick upward in what would become an enormous winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn4juj"&gt;Intuitively, cyberattacks on hospitals seem like they’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;dangerous for patients&lt;/a&gt;. Shutting down computer systems shuts off access to patient scans, can lock physicians out of tools they need to provide care, and creates backlogs in the operating systems. But despite years of attacks, there’s very little data on whether those disruptions actually caused harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RRyU4"&gt;The specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, gave experts an opening to see what the UVM attack meant for patient care. Because hospital systems were already strained caring for COVID-19 patients, any additional stressors — like a ransomware attack — could be seen more clearly. So, when a team at the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) scrutinized the data, they were able to show that patients did worse in hospitals navigating a cyberware attack than in hospitals that didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YdWeeD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIVMQx"&gt;The findings, which are still unpublished, should help push back on any groups hesitant to say that cyberattacks are dangerous for patients, says Josh Corman, a senior adviser to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568397/covid-vaccine-cybersecurity-cisa-task-force"&gt;CISA&lt;/a&gt;, the federal agency that advises on government and private sector cybersecurity issues. “We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vZ7R8Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAnHti"&gt;Data in the field is so thin that experts turn to marathons to make the argument that cyberattacks will harm patients. They often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;point to&lt;/a&gt; one particular bit of research: &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1614073"&gt;a 2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that looked at emergency care during marathons in the United States. The study found people who had heart attacks during a marathon were at higher risk of death within a month than people who had heart attacks on other days, likely because it took longer for them to get the care they needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIKw6G"&gt;It’s not a perfect analogy, but like marathons (which close roads and cause delays for ambulances), ransomware attacks can force hospitals to divert ambulances or delay treatments. It’s one of the clearer pieces of evidence available. It has been hard to get a good picture of the same phenomenon during ransomware attacks because the numbers tend to be so small, says Mark Jarrett, chief quality officer at Northwell Health in New York. “You really need an approach that looks at data across the country, so you can get a large enough denominator that you’ll be able to get a numerator that really means something,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9ecZ3"&gt;Hospitals also tend to be tight-lipped about ransomware attacks. They &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/business/2019/12/hackensack-meridian-hospital-chain-confirms-ransomware-attack-last-week.html"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21482304/ransomware-outage-hospital-chain-cybersecurity"&gt;go days&lt;/a&gt; before announcing that systems are down because of a cyberattack, and often &lt;a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/data-breaches/news/21153617/six-weeks-later-new-yorks-samaritan-health-still-recovering-from-malware-attack"&gt;don’t share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/scripps-health-still-grappling-with-impact-of-may-1-ransomware-attack/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.villages-news.com/2021/06/03/new-coo-takes-over-as-ransomware-attack-cripples-the-villages-hospital/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; about the impact an attack is actually having on day-to-day operations. It would likely be a challenge to convince an organization to agree to any investigation into the impact of an attack on its patient care, says Sung Choi, assistant professor at the University of Central Florida department of health management and informatics who studies healthcare cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hcrHHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVDvqQ"&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p3bIv"&gt;There hasn’t even been a close analysis of the potential health harms from the 2017 WannaCry cyberattack, which downed computers across the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and threw the system into chaos, Corman says. Just looking at stroke patients should give a sense of what the harm might have been, he says — if people having a stroke don’t make it to a health facility that can handle the emergency quickly, they’re more likely to have a bad outcome. During a few days of the WannaCry attack, there were no stroke centers open in London. “The official line is that no one died. It strains credulity,” he says. “There’s such a palpable, visceral reluctance to admit that we’ve lost lives because of cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aODhm8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrDHod"&gt;The pandemic gave Corman and his team at CISA an opening to get a clearer picture of the harm caused by ransomware attacks. The work started with its analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html"&gt;excess death&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Excess deaths, which count the number of deaths above normal during a given time of the year, help outline the true toll of an event like a COVID-19 outbreak — it helps show COVID-19 deaths that may have not been counted in the official toll, and how many people may have died because of disruptions in their care during the chaos of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzAEdB"&gt;The team was interested in trying to figure out ways to predict when there might be excess deaths regionally or nationally. Normally, when hospitals get overburdened because of a local emergency, they’re able to divert ambulances, reschedule surgeries, and lean on the other healthcare resources in the community. There’s slack in the system to make that possible. Eventually, they might reach a point where they weren’t able to provide adequate care to the people they were treating, but it would take a long time to reach that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgwxX8"&gt;But during COVID-19 outbreaks, every hospital was under stress. “No one could absorb anything,” Corman says. “Regions could shift through this more quickly.” They’d reach a point where there were too many patients to handle faster than normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnmmnZ"&gt;In their analysis, the CISA team figured out that once an area had a certain percentage of intensive care unit beds filled, they were more likely to start to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later. It was an inflection point — a strong indicator that the area was approaching a capacity issue that would tip over into higher death rates, Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zDLhDC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was a natural experiment in the state”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIxQB"&gt;With that metric in mind, the CISA team looked at the excess death data in the state of Vermont during the UVM ransomware attack. “It was a natural experiment in the state,” Corman says. They found that during the same time period, with the pandemic going on in the background, hospitals affected by the ransomware attack reached that inflection point earlier than unaffected hospitals and remained there longer. “You’re reaching that danger zone where you’re going to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later more quickly,” he says. “Water is wet, fire is hot, and we can now tell that cyber disruption introduces degraded or delayed patient care.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX6DWB"&gt;Data scientists working on the project also think Vermont was the best-case scenario, Corman says — in other states with poorer overall health, the effect might be more dramatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNtGt"&gt;The UVM Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w48rAi"&gt;The pandemic created an environment where the CISA team was able to see the impact of ransomware more easily — excess deaths were already so high that the trends and patterns were easy to pick out. The same patterns, though, likely hold true outside of the pandemic, Corman says. A ransomware attack puts stress on a hospital system, delaying care, which could lead to bad outcomes. The impact may be less dramatic when there isn’t another emergency, but experts could use the same framework to scrutinize ransomware attacks at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vpkpqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yhVD38"&gt;The CISA analysis is still ongoing and circulating through the federal government, and Corman isn’t sure when the final conclusions will be published. But having a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action, Northwell Health’s Jarrett says. “Patient safety should always be driven by data, so having the data will make a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1A00a"&gt;Data from CISA could be a good first step. Jarrett hopes there could also be analysis of harm to patients who don’t necessarily die, but who have worse health outcomes because of delays in their care. “Not everyone dies, thankfully,” he says. But a heart attack patient who isn’t seen quickly enough could have permanent damage. “Your health going forward is not going to be the same level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1zofjk"&gt;Any hospital facing down a ransomware attack should do their own analysis of what went wrong and what the implications were for patients, Jarrett says. “Clinicians in general tend to think of this as an information technology issue, and it really isn’t. It’s a patient safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BvuW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gp7w1B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SycXJmpiUoH2WDxxj3-g3fucw3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747985/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auMO0T"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045875-facebook-revised-ftc-complaint"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed by the court in June&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9MNw"&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s durable monopoly power in social networking services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF60pB"&gt;Facebook has until October 4th to issue a legal response to the complaint. In a post on Twitter, Facebook’s corporate account said the company was reviewing the complaint and “will have more to say soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BV6VIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oW3sSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;First filed in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleges that Facebook’s acquisitions of competing networks gave it monopoly power over social network services in the US. But the following June, the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the commission had failed to provide sufficient evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in social networks. However, the court gave the FTC an opportunity to file an amended complaint that addressed the concerns, eventually setting the deadline &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ftc-asks-more-time-file-amended-complaint-facebook-case-2021-07-23/"&gt;for August 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udBnmO"&gt;Together with the amended complaint, the FTC also made clear that chair Lina Khan will continue to play an active role in the case. In July, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;called on Khan&lt;/a&gt; to recuse herself from the agency’s lawsuit against the company based on her, based on her legal scholarship. “For the entirety of her professional career, Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws,” the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUFGhK"&gt;That effort appears to have been unsuccessful. “As the case will be prosecuted before a federal judge, the appropriate constitutional due process protections will be provided to the company,” the agency said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428380607957045250?s=20"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufWtUE"&gt;In particular, the new complaint contains a more rigorous definition of personal social networks, the market in which Facebook holds the alleged monopoly. The new complaint explicitly distinguishes Facebook from services like TikTok, which broadcast content, but do not provide an explicitly social space. The FTC’s definition also excludes services like Twitter and Reddit that share information among communities with specific interests but “do not focus on connecting friends and family.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa7VJ5"&gt;The complaint cites a number of internal messages to establish that Facebook understands this difference, although the specific content of the messages is redacted in the public version of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc6gfc"&gt;“Facebook... has been the dominant provider of such services since at least 2011,” the complaint concludes. “Further, Facebook Blue and Instagram are the two largest personal social networking services in the United States.” By the FTC’s definition, Facebook’s only significant competitor in the space is Snapchat, although defunct providers include Friendster, Myspace, Google+, and Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT9H6J"&gt;Once that market is defined, the complaint relies heavily on attention metrics to establish Facebook’s dominance — particularly monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs) and time spent on-site — citing similar cases in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom that have based their claims on those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHeB7L"&gt;One weakness of this approach is that both Facebook and Instagram can serve multiple functions, raising the possibility that some of the metrics are in fact reflecting use of Facebook as a photo-sharing service, messaging platform, or other non-social purpose. But the FTC claims Facebook’s advantage by those metrics is so dominant as to swamp any alternative uses of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORVYi6"&gt;“Even if one were to assume, &lt;em&gt;arguendo&lt;/em&gt;, that half of the time that U.S. users spend on Facebook Blue and Instagram was not in fact spent using personal social networking services,” the FTC reasons, “Facebook would still have maintained a dominant share of the U.S. personal social networking market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1KYyQk"&gt;In a particularly striking turn, the new complaint also makes the case that Facebook’s continued success in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal (and associated settlements) show’s how implacable the company has become. “Facebook’s ability to harm users by decreasing product quality, without losing significant user engagement, indicates that Facebook has market power,” the complaint reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSoJ9M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cG1Uvq"&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFPgb1hWmFA6kP1Emyr-uc25Ov0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747879/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnSUn"&gt;Today is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"&gt;Tesla’s AI Day&lt;/a&gt;, a sequel of sorts to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions"&gt;Autonomy Day&lt;/a&gt; event held in 2019. The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA, &lt;a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"&gt;will be livestreamed for the public&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5PM PT / 8PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 5:30PM PT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O23w6E"&gt;We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’ll get a keynote address by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in the Model S Plaid, and “more.” Musk has also tweeted that the “sole goal” of the event is to lure experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YriMOi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has been holding events to highlight certain technologies that the company views as essential to its future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZD9Yb"&gt;Tesla usually holds around two public events a year. This year, we got the Tesla Model S Plaid launch event in June, and now AI Day. Over the past few years, Tesla has been holding events, not to unveil new products, but to highlight certain technologies that the company views as crucial to its future development. Last year, Tesla held its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Battery Day event&lt;/a&gt;, at which it discussed plans to drive down the cost of battery development with the goal of producing a $25,000 electric car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tfSJ58"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Tesla’s AI day event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywbAs5"&gt;AI Day is expected to pick up on the themes first introduced during Autonomy Day, which include the manufacturing of Tesla’s own silicon computer chips to power it’s Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXcb56"&gt;This AI Day comes at an awkward time for the company. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; for the nearly dozen incidents in which its cars crashed into emergency vehicles. Two Democratic senators also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s marketing practices for potentially misleading information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battery power capacity in the US grew big time in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Cooperative Connexus Energy Builds Minnesota’s First Large-Scale Energy Storage System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVor0NaPIkGzDpZ47Cxa1cUOFLs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747812/1031531618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A worker installs solar panel at the Connexus Energy Athens Township solar-plus-storage project site in Athens Township, Minnesota, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018.  | Ari Lindquist/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qibmO"&gt;2020 was a big year for big batteries in the US, which is crucial for getting grids to run on more renewable energy. Power capacity — a measure of how much power a battery can instantly discharge — for large-scale batteries grew at an unprecedented pace in the US last year, according to an annual &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HmkjbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcHGs2"&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018 for the biggest growth in power capacity in the US with 489MW of large-scale battery storage added. That’s more than twice what was added in 2018. By the end of last year, there was 1,523MW of large-scale battery power capacity in the US. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.sunpower.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcs-solar-star-projects-fact-sheet_0.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632172%2Flarge-battery-power-capacity-us-grew-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest solar farm in the US&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of 579MW and can generate enough electricity for about 255,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao0swK"&gt;That’s all good news for renewable energy, but way more batteries are needed to clean up the electricity grid. “It’s great that it’s growing. But by the scale of the grid, it’s still a pretty small drop in the bucket,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. For perspective, Ceder says, the total battery power capacity in the US at the end of 2020 is still “no bigger than one or two big power plants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4dA3T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Still a pretty small drop in the bucket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIFEK"&gt;Batteries store renewable energy so it can be used when winds lull and sunlight dims. They’re also a clean &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KQEt5QqPXU"&gt;alternative to fossil-fueled “peaker plants”&lt;/a&gt; that come online periodically to provide extra juice when there’s high demand. Big batteries can also step in when a disaster knocks another power source offline. So on top of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions, they can make the grid more reliable and resilient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYDsrm"&gt;Electricity is currently responsible for a quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions in the US&lt;/a&gt;. But a clean grid could tackle emissions from other sectors like transportation and heating as cars, homes, and buildings go all-electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e868RZ"&gt;The Biden administration has set a target of making the power sector “carbon pollution-free” by 2035, in an effort to slow down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;already catastrophic effects&lt;/a&gt; of climate change. That can be achieved by turning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Or the goal could potentially be met through a combination of renewables plus more controversial carbon-free energy from nuclear plants and fossil-fueled power plants paired with technology that captures carbon dioxide from their emissions. But with concerns about the cost, safety, and pollution from nuclear energy and carbon capture strategies, many environmental advocates hope batteries can ensure that there’s a bigger proportion of renewable energy feeding the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="10g4JL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPbtt7"&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled 72 percent since 2015, the EIA found, which helps explain why the vast majority of large-scale battery storage power capacity available today only came online within the past six years. Electric vehicles have helped drive down lithium-ion battery costs in the power sector, according to Ceder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcJ5mf"&gt;As costs fall, battery power capacity is forecast to grow quickly in the coming years. There’s 10,000MW of large-scale battery storage on the way from now until 2023, according to what utilities have reported to the EIA. That’s ten times the capacity there was in 2019, and most of it will be paired with solar power generators.&lt;/p&gt;
