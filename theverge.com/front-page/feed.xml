    <title>Samsung Display promises thinner laptop bezels with unproven under-screen webcams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwyVrQo9wzMU5iT19i6XYToNWlw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666096/msedge_rwEweZw7ip.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The technology makes for smaller bezels, without having to relocate the laptop’s webcam.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://weibointl.api.weibo.com/share/195887625.html" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Display&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mUHESj"&gt;Samsung Display has released a teaser for its under-screen camera technology meant for laptops, dubbed “Samsung Blade Bezel,” &lt;a href="http://weibointl.api.weibo.com/share/195887625.html"&gt;on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt;. It promises that its “UPC” (Under Panel Camera) tech can make a laptop’s bezels smaller without having to relocate its webcam, while also making the OLED display itself be both thinner and lighter. There’s no mention of the impact of the technology on the webcam’s image quality, however, which has become increasingly important in the age of social distancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvmR21"&gt;We saw the first smartphone with an under-display selfie camera release commercially last year. However, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;ZTE Axon 20 5G’s&lt;/a&gt; implementation of the feature simply wasn’t very good. The quality of its selfie camera photos was poor, and the portion of the display that covered the camera suffered from much lower resolution than the rest of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTQogr"&gt;This isn’t the first time we’ve heard about Samsung Display’s under-panel camera plans. Previously, however, attention has focused on its use in smartphones, where manufacturers have obsessed over reducing bezel size in recent years. Back in 2018, Samsung Display mentioned under-display camera technology &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-display-under-display-camera/"&gt;during a presentation&lt;/a&gt; about the future of phone design, and the following year an executive said the technology could be ready for use in smartphones “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265265/samsung-all-display-phone-under-screen-selfie-camera-no-cutout"&gt;in the next 1-2 years.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sKrJBr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wow ⊙∀⊙! Samsung Display reveals its under-Display camera technology for the first time, which will be used for OLED notebook screens first &lt;a href="https://t.co/Fu4Ublvsru"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fu4Ublvsru&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1349591727854682112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Cbicw"&gt;Now, it seems, the technology is also headed to laptops, where it could allow for smaller bezels without having to relocate the webcam to below the screen. That’s the approach taken by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17396818/huawei-matebook-x-pro-laptop-review-specs-price"&gt;Huawei’s MateBook X Pro&lt;/a&gt; which has small screen bezels thanks to a webcam that’s built into its keyboard. Unfortunately, this placement means the webcam is directed at you from a very low angle, when ideally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21202907/zoom-tips-video-call-lighting-audio-look-your-best"&gt;you want it to be positioned at eye-level&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; has a small bezel that’s still big enough for a webcam, but the camera’s quality isn’t great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCgcpl"&gt;While the technology could make for better-looking laptops, it’s unlikely to do much for the image quality of built-in webcams themselves which continue to suffer from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daqPLDDAntA"&gt;stubbornly low-quality&lt;/a&gt; despite their sudden importance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;in the age of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, laptops with better webcams, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20932406/microsoft-surface-laptop-3-13-5-inch-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Surface Laptop 3&lt;/a&gt;, tend to have larger bezels needed to house beefier imaging components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwAfiP"&gt;Samsung Display provides panels to a variety of different manufacturers. That means we could see Samsung Blade Bezel technology appear in laptops across the industry, rather than being confined to Samsung’s own devices. Today’s teaser doesn’t mention when the first laptop with the technology could release, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaeCLU"&gt;As for when an under-display camera could appear in Samsung’s smartphones, a recent &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=8012"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;suggested that it might make its debut in the company’s third-generation Fold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest is getting multi-user support soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB63rmJnH3-_dNuYqomdQTdw0n8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68666018/akrales_200904_4160_0390.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RZggSU"&gt;Oculus Quest headsets will soon support multiple users, Facebook has &lt;a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/multi-user-accounts-and-app-sharing-coming-soon/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality will allow Quest owners to set secondary accounts on their headsets, which will allow other people to log in and access content shared by the primary user while maintaining separate save data and achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YRqzWp"&gt;The primary account holder will be able to add three secondary accounts and share apps on a single device, though Facebook says you’ll later be able to share purchases across three headsets; the company may also adjust these parameters based on feedback. Apps will be automatically opted-in to the sharing functionality, but developers can opt out before February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jRkpbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Facebook’s ‘one identity’ rule has to change for&amp;amp;nbsp;VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22221251/facebook-reality-labs-boz-andrew-bosworth-interview-privacy-moderation-horizon-ar-vr"},{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S7Y4Kj"&gt;The Quest 2’s Facebook account requirement has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt;, and unsurprisingly nothing changes here — secondary account users will have to log in with a Facebook account of their own. For households that already have multiple Quest users, though, the features should make life easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vn2e2q"&gt;Facebook says the functionality will come to the Quest 2 next month in experimental form, meaning you can switch it on with a toggle in the settings menu before it gets released to all Quest headsets, including the original model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Nintendo World opening delayed due to Osaka state of emergency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9teXrkJIcY62hIDrM7vxlf2Gnao=/0x0:2756x1837/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665821/image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mrvm20"&gt;Universal Studios Japan has &lt;a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/company/news/2021/0114.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Super Nintendo World will not be opening next month as planned. The Nintendo-themed zone of the Osaka park was supposed to open on February 4th after its launch was delayed from last year, but with Osaka being placed under a state of emergency declaration yesterday until at least February 7th, that’s no longer going to happen. USJ says it will announce a new opening date once the state of emergency has been lifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrjCh"&gt;The state of emergency in Japan was initially issued for Tokyo and its surrounding areas, but yesterday the order was expanded to cover a total of 11 prefectures, Osaka included. The countermeasures aren’t particularly strong compared to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions elsewhere — people are discouraged from making non-essential trips outside, and establishments like restaurants and movie theaters are asked to close earlier in the evening — but it obviously still is not the ideal time to open a theme park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exjDr0"&gt;Super Nintendo World is an important project for Nintendo, representing the most ambitious attempt yet to expand its IP into new business opportunities. The park was initially set to open in time for the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, which themselves remain in serious doubt. When it does eventually open, it’ll feature attractions like an AR-powered &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt; rollercoaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is working on a fix for Pixel 4A 5G touchscreen woes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WA4VgG46-A0OT6SNdczAkoyuvQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665252/akrales_201013_4137_0289.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Pixel 4a 5G’s 6.2-inch touchscreen has been acting up for some users. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUco78"&gt;Google says it’s aware of a problem with Pixel 4A 5G touchscreens and is working on a fix. Some devices are failing to respond consistently to taps on the lower part of the screen, which is particularly impacting folks who have opted for three-button navigation rather than swipes. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/12/pixel-4a-5g-touchscreen-issue-can-make-navigation-buttons-hard-to-use/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; spotted complaints&lt;/a&gt; from 4A 5G owners experiencing the issue, which seems to have cropped up after the December security patch was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrWHuU"&gt;Google’s response comes courtesy of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87628791?hl=en"&gt;a Pixel support forum post&lt;/a&gt;. The company says it will address the problem ”in an upcoming software update”, but it’s looking like that will be at least a couple more weeks away since &lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports January’s security patch didn’t address it. In the meantime, Google advises users to work around the issue with some specific instructions on tapping navigation controls: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oR34Vr"&gt;1. When tapping icons on the edge of the screen, tap the center of the button or the side of the button/icon furthest away from the edge of the display.&lt;br&gt;2. When tapping icons, including the navigation buttons on the bottom of your screen, use the tip of your finger or thumb instead. This will help improve touch recognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SjP3BP"&gt;It’s not an easy task to try and consciously change the way you do something like tap a button on your phone screen, so hopefully Pixel 4A 5G users will only have to attempt these awkward workarounds for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qGgly1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 4A 5G review: more than just a bigger budget phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zwGZTa"&gt;Google’s January patch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22214270/google-pixel-january-update-5-system-sounds-loud-issue"&gt;did address a raft of other Pixel 4A 5G bugs&lt;/a&gt; and quirks with the security update. So while the touchscreen issue persists, at least an audio bug that was causing crackling sounds in some situations is no longer a problem. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hack together your own e-paper smartwatch with this $50 open-source kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the Watchy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_vC6URRWgZB1haQgBPgS9c0xbk=/1x0:2401x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665156/2020_12_18T19_22_27.654Z_P1010103_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SQFMI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjh39e"&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4R3hODnTGo&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;be like Steve Wozniak&lt;/a&gt; and have your own custom-made, geeky watch, Squarofumi (stylized SQFMI) may have the product for you: an open-source, Arduino-powered smartwatch with a 1.54-inch e-paper screen (&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-watchy-is-an-open-source-smartwatch-for-those-who-m-1846050151?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;amp;utm_content=gizmodo"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com"&gt;It’s called the Watchy&lt;/a&gt;, and both the hardware and software are completely customizable. You can, however, use it right out of the box, as the PCB acts as the body and has points to attach a watch strap. And to top it all off, it’s only $50, on sale for $45 at time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U63Loq"&gt;The SQFMI site has sections for watch faces and cases, but at the moment they both only say “Coming Soon,” so if you're thinking about this watch, you’ll definitely want to make sure you’re ready for a DIY project. Oh, and there’s also the fact that the watch doesn’t come assembled — you have to put it together yourself, hooking the 200x200 display, PCB, and 200mAh battery together. There’s Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, a 3-axis accelerometer and four buttons that can be used for navigation, or whatever other functions you can dream up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wow4gSHfxWt2ZpyLX1Kak4ER7Ik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22234330/2020_12_05T19_21_11.065Z_watchy_outline.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graphic: SQFMI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Watchy has hardware that DIYers may be familiar with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0rvQhU"&gt;If having to put together the hardware yourself doesn’t intimidate you, there’s one last thing to note: while the watch does come with pre-loaded software, if you want to make any changes to the watch face you’ll have to download the Arduino IDE and program them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEE7Qp"&gt;While some people may be turned off by all the work required to get the watch working, to certain people the build-it-yourself approach means that they’ll be able to get exactly what they want. If you want a watch with a case that looks like an iPod or Game Boy, with an interface to match, you can 3D print a case and code the watch face yourself. It’s the type of freedom you’re not likely to get from most commercial smartwatches, though Tizen and Wear OS watches do offer downloadable watch faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWXg1P"&gt;The battery life SQFMI estimates depends on your use case — it says if you’re just keeping time you should get five to seven days, but if you’re fetching data frequently you may only see two to three. Its open-source nature, however, means that you could always fit a larger battery into it, or try and make some software optimizations if there are features you’re willing to cut.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZfQWo8ftqclLna8pnidcRgsUdOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22234329/2020_12_18T19_22_01.957Z_P1010095.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: SQFMI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch uses a ESP32 SOC, which can be programmed with Arduino and MicroPython.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vZLy3P"&gt;If you’re looking for this kind of coding/DIY project, the &lt;a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/sqfmi/watchy/#product-description"&gt;Watchy is being sold on Tindie&lt;/a&gt;. I’d just recommend you look at SQFMI’s website to make sure that &lt;a href="https://watchy.sqfmi.com/docs/getting-started"&gt;the amount of documentation available&lt;/a&gt; is enough for you to get started.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says a new video from Trump doesn’t break the rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTPWOsI2lIVhiXoNHroQvlP86Tk=/7x0:598x394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68665026/trump_twitter_white_house.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R0R1IC"&gt;On January 8th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter permanently banned President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, and proceeded to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221683/trump-tried-to-evade-his-ban-with-potus-but-those-tweets-were-instantly-deleted"&gt;play whack-a-mole&lt;/a&gt; as he attempted to dodge that ban by using different Twitter accounts, each of which Twitter suspended in turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvUiRg"&gt;And yet less than a week later, a Trump video has been posted on the official @WhiteHouse account delivering &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1349492130578919425"&gt;a new video speech&lt;/a&gt;. The speech is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; inflammatory — quite the opposite. It features Trump denouncing violence, lawbreaking, and vandalism. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98Kmv6Yi6icywEkRfAgFk44IwZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22234255/white_house_twitter_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="akZvjJ"&gt;It contains messages many might have hoped Trump would issue immediately during or perhaps even before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;the attack on the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt;, to avoid the violence and the five deaths that occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20zNVn"&gt;Still, it’s very strange to see Trump’s face in a new Twitter video, considering such a video was one of the inciting incidents that got Trump kicked off the platform. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217697/twitter-trump-facebook-restrict-violence-tweet-video-capitol-riot-maga"&gt;Twitter initially removed that video due to a “risk of violence”&lt;/a&gt; before deciding it was too risky to allow Trump to retain an account at all... and yet he’s now able to publish a video speech to Twitter from a different account. When Twitter banned Trump, the company told us it would try to limit the use of even government accounts like @WhiteHouse if Trump tried to use them to evade his ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbyVIA"&gt;But Twitter told NBC reporter Dylan Byers that this doesn’t constitute a ban evasion at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mFH5Fl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“…  demonstrably engage in ban evasion or share content that otherwise violates the Twitter Rules.” (2/2)&lt;/p&gt;— Dylan Byers (@DylanByers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DylanByers/status/1349508462842060800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9soBpl"&gt;When we asked how this doesn’t count as ban evasion, Twitter declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey defends Twitter’s Trump ban, then enthuses about bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tech CEO’s Testify Remotely Before Senate Judiciary" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQFIV08KOeIpr6tFcBQc4cLZtI0=/143x0:3323x2120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664984/1229659186.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hannah McKay-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SFoDkm"&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, in a series of Tweets, explained that he felt banning US President Donald Trump’s account was the right move for the social network. “Offline harm as a result of online speech is demonstrably real, and what drives our policy and enforcement above all,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="asdaR4"&gt;Dorsey blamed Twitter’s failure “to promote healthy conversation,” acknowledged that Twitter needs to “look critically at inconsistencies of our policy and enforcement,” and said that social platforms needed more transparency around moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl97m9"&gt;Then, Dorsey plugged an effort to build a decentralized standard for social media he began in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;2019 when he sought to hire five engineers&lt;/a&gt; to work on it. That’s how, eight tweets into a thread on why his company banned Donald Trump, the CEO of Twitter managed to change the subject to his passion for bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZZ5OlB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The reason I have so much passion for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; is largely because of the model it demonstrates: a foundational internet technology that is not controlled or influenced by any single individual or entity. This is what the internet wants to be, and over time, more of it will be.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510779033174016?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G0b0bA"&gt;Five days ago, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;permanently banned Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt; “due to the risk of further incitement of violence,” the company said in a statement. The ban was instated two days after the president incited a mob broke into the US Capitol to disrupt Congress, which was certifying Joe Biden’s election win. When Twitter banned him, they said two of his tweets incited more violence. Trump was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;banned indefinitely &lt;/a&gt;by Facebook that day. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22218757/youtube-trump-account-video-deleted-uploads-suspension-indefinite"&gt;YouTube suspended his account&lt;/a&gt;. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230001/snapchat-trump-ban-permanently-account-january-20th-innaguration-snap"&gt;the president was banned from Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60OKiB"&gt;Banning the RealDonaldTrump Twitter account had “real and significant ramifications,” Dorsey wrote. Dorsey said that the widespread suspension of the president by many platforms challenged the notion that if people didn’t like Twitter’s rules, they could simply go somewhere else. And though the president can issue a press release or call a press conference whenever he wishes — or simply go on television — Dorsey expressed concern that the enforcement actions might “erode a free and open global internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyOuZB"&gt;And that was when bitcoin came up. Dorsey is also CEO of Square, an internet payment company, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;bought $50 million of bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; as part of a bet on cryptocurrency. Square has accepted bitcoin since 2014. According to Dorsey, bitcoin provides a model for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;decentralized model for social media&lt;/a&gt;. Dorsey did not elaborate on how such a network might address Twitter’s failures in moderation, creating healthy conversations, or provide for more consistent policy enforcment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c47LTx"&gt;“It’s important that we acknowledge this is a time of great uncertainty and struggle for so many around the world,” Dorsey wrote on Twitter.  “Our goal in this moment is to disarm as much as we can, and ensure we are all building towards a greater common understanding, and a more peaceful existence on earth. I believe the internet and global public conversation is our best and most relevant method of achieving this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PNd7H"&gt;Although Jack Dorsey first proposed the decentralized social media standard he calls “bluesky” in December 2019, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510782417920001"&gt;today he wrote that Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is still “in the process of interviewing and hiring folks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will permanently terminate Trump’s account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Arrives In Texas For Border Visit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTKjPnnOhpZs-lxj2Bok4IiNALA=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664932/1230553573.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Go Nakamura/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EmHsfK"&gt;Snapchat will permanently terminate President Trump’s account, Snap announced on Wednesday. Snap had indefinitely suspended Trump’s account last week after he incited a pro-Trump mob to attack the US Capitol, and it has now made the decision to make that suspension permanent. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-snapchat-will-permanently-ban-trumps-account-05419dd3-fed6-4614-9ed0-c2d606ef0e62.html"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLigXL"&gt;“Last week we announced an indefinite suspension of President Trump’s Snapchat account, and have been assessing what long term action is in the best interest of our Snapchat community,” Snap said in a statement shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In the interest of public safety, and based on his attempts to spread misinformation, hate speech, and incite violence, which are clear violations of our guidelines, we have made the decision to permanently terminate his account.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdWY7m"&gt;Trump had attempted to violate Snapchat’s polices dozens of times, Snap tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company had also sent warnings to his team about content that violated the rules. The permanent ban officially goes into effect on January 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKD8xD"&gt;The recent actions aren’t the only moves Snap has made to restrict Trump’s account — the company stopped promoting Trump’s account in its Discover tab back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21279280/snapchat-snap-remove-trump-account-discover-promotion-incite-violence-twitter"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; following tweets Trump posted in response to Black Lives Matter protests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cve2m7"&gt;Snapchat joins &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;Twitter in permanently banning Trump&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook has indefinitely banned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Trump’s account&lt;/a&gt;, and Shopify has taken down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fistful of Samsung Galaxy S21 phones is perhaps the ultimate leak  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of a person purportedly holding three Samsung phones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEWMfFPMZgHBrxzC6_GgE115vMo=/0x481:1150x1248/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664608/Ero0eYGXUAIs5en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: @We_The_Techies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuglGL"&gt;You’ve seen the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uwmw_o6_3LQ"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187074/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaked-colors-plus-ultra"&gt;leaked renders&lt;/a&gt;. Now, only a day before the launch, you can see what the entire Galaxy S21 lineup looks like in a real person’s hand, thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/We_The_Techies/status/1349448741640613889?s=20"&gt;Twitter user Mr.Techie&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-family-1192643/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKoTzc"&gt;The images also provide a good size comparison between the rumored regular, Plus, and Ultra variants of the phone. We also get to see at least three of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227941/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-brown-zune-unpacked-2021"&gt;the colors&lt;/a&gt;, and in my opinion the purple is looking &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; nice, but does seem to continue the trend of collecting fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zkfrB3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Samsung sent &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MrTTechie?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MrTTechie&lt;/a&gt; a few demos ahead of tomorrow’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unpacked2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unpacked2021&lt;/a&gt; event.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgBJ7u"&gt;Mr.Techie also mentions that the S21 Ultra is on the thick side, though given its dark color it can be a bit hard to compare with the other phone he’s holding in the image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/13/22229034/samsung-galaxy-s21-leaks-news-rumors-stylus-ultra-plus-carrying-case-video-trailer-specs"&gt;Given the rumored specs&lt;/a&gt;, that may not be too much of a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LU4b7R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/S21Ultra?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#S21Ultra&lt;/a&gt; is THICKKKK  I haven't held such a thick flagship in years.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e45mu"&gt;These leaks are coming in just under the wire, as the launch event is happening tomorrow. If these pictures don’t quite satisfy your curiosity, you can check &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22220913/samsung-unpacked-event-date-time-galaxy-s21-phones-earbuds"&gt;out our article about what to expect at the event&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, it’s hard to imagine how anything more about these phones could be leaked, short of them showing up at people’s doorsteps tomorrow morning before the reveal. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla asked to recall 158,000 cars for failing displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/REWMOTn5-CRwadpgWvXTS2aZPkk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68664472/twarren_170912_1995_0032.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lee Quinones&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wIa3Lf"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has asked Tesla to recall some 158,000 Model S and Model X vehicles that could suffer from failing display consoles, according to a &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2020/INRM-EA20003-11321.pdf"&gt;letter published by the agency on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The failures of the so-called “media control units” in these vehicles can sever the owner’s access to their vehicle’s backup camera, climate controls, and Tesla’s Autopilot driver assistance system, increasing the risk of a crash, the safety agency says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nGM7m"&gt;The problem at the heart of the defect that NHTSA wants Tesla to fix involves worn-out flash memory chips used in the displays of 2012-2018 Model S sedans and 2016-2018 Model X SUVs. Each time an owner turns on one of these Teslas, it eats away at the total capacity of the the 8GB eMMC NAND flash memory chip onboard the NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor that powers the displays. When that capacity is reached — usually about five to six years later, the agency says — the displays become bricked. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvgxqp/worn-out-flash-memory-is-suddenly-bricking-tesla-cars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt; on the issue in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGlbcL"&gt;Tesla confirmed to NHTSA that all units with this chip “will inevitably fail,” according to the agency, and also provided a statistical model showing projected weekly repairs lasting from 2020 to 2028, with the most failures happening in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L2YguS"&gt;NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301676/tesla-nhtsa-touchscreen-failure-investigation-model-s"&gt;opened a formal investigation into the problem last June&lt;/a&gt;, and said Wednesday that the probe is still ongoing despite the request that Tesla recall the vehicles. It’s unclear if Tesla will comply. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxdVRP"&gt;In the letter, NHTSA acknowledges that Tesla has issued over-the-air software updates meant to mitigate the failures, but the agency believes those don’t go far enough — especially because the problem cuts access to the backup camera, which is now a federally mandated feature. “[T]hese updates are procedurally and substantively insufficient,” the agency writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sll7M"&gt;While Tesla popularized the use of large touchscreen displays in cars, it had more than one problem with these earlier models. Beyond the flash memory issue at the heart of NHTSA’s recall request, early Tesla displays also suffered from bubbling and yellow banding since &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/27989/teslas-screen-saga-shows-why-automotive-grade-matters"&gt;they were not up to typical automotive standards&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
