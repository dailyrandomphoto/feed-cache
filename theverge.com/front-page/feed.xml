    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Volvo’s first EV is an impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity and electric performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4rUWG8"&gt;There’s been an avalanche of new electric vehicles announced in the past year and a half, ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;luxurious&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502032/volkswagen-id4-electric-suv-first-drive-vw"&gt;practical&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;garish&lt;/a&gt;. So you’d be forgiven if you forgot about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915841/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-suv-specs-miles-range-reveal"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, a great compact SUV with a terrible name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vizyM6"&gt;I won’t judge Volvo too harshly for its name choice. The Swedish automaker wanted to convey the simple message that this was a familiar vehicle with a new powertrain. And “XC40 Recharge” certainly gets that point across. That said, it’s an uninspiring name for what is arguably a fantastic EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rBLTxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;an uninspiring name for what is arguably a fantastic EV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k0fzF4"&gt;I got a chance to drive Volvo’s first all-electric vehicle around northwestern New Jersey for around two hours on a recent Friday. The roads were freshly plowed, the sky was a cloudless blue, and the XC40 Recharge was an able and attractive partner for my jaunt through the snowy woods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t3jfK"&gt;I already had an inkling of what to expect with the XC40 Recharge, having driven its sister EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, earlier in the year. Like the Polestar 2, the XC40 Recharge is built on Volvo’s Compact Modular Architecture (CMA), an advanced vehicle platform co-developed within the Geely Group, Volvo’s parent company, which already powers the plug-in hybrid version of the XC40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLK4EK"&gt;The XC40 Recharge also comes with Android Automotive, the native version of Google’s Android Auto operating system. This voice-activated system can control everything from navigation (“Hey Google, take me home”) to music (“Hey Google, play some Swedish death metal”) to heating and air conditioning (“Hey Google, turn on my seat warmer”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM0UczG6kXBbHHJvuKfz8WefiBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189074/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Q8E1sVY4FcdwuQorla8FoFVZdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189077/ahawkins_201221_4352_6480.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pm8wKL"&gt;Having already driven the Polestar 2, I was familiar with Android Automotive. But it was no less revelatory than the first time. There’s something immensely satisfying about using my voice to control all the in-car minutiae rather than fumble around on a touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIRKnF"&gt;It’s also uniquely tailored to running the infotainment system in an electric vehicle. When you ask Google to navigate you to a certain location, the Android-powered operating system will take into account your battery levels and incorporate charging stations that are available along the way. That should go a long way toward quelling any range anxiety you may have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7bCU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s something immensely satisfying about using my voice to control all the in-car minutiae&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9tg6bB"&gt;From the outside, the XC40 Recharge looks (surprise!) exactly like the gas-powered XC40, but with a smooth grille and no tailpipes. There are familiar touches, like the “Thor’s hammer” front headlights that are common across Volvo’s lineup. But the XC40 Recharge is delightfully nondescript. It looks like a typical Volvo with a few futuristic flourishes. I received no second glances from passersby and was able to blend into my environment, which typically isn’t the case with a new EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM0Tz2"&gt;The XC40 Recharge has a key — a chunky-looking fob that fortunately is immediately made irrelevant because this is a car that can be turned on using only your phone. Once seated, you only need to close the door, press the brake pedal, and click the gear shift to the desired direction in order to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSVQfv"&gt;The 400-volt battery, made by South Korea’s LG Chem and located in the floor of the vehicle, has the capacity of 78kWh (75kWh of which is usable) — on par with other electric crossovers like the Tesla Model Y and the Volkswagen ID 4. But the XC40 Recharge will only get a little more than 200 miles of range per charge, which is significantly less than those other compact SUV EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhDPcX"&gt;I didn’t have enough time with the car to test out the range nor the charging experience, but Volvo says drivers can expect to get a lot of power pumped back into the battery thanks to the XC40 Recharge’s regenerative brakes, especially while using one-pedal driving. The battery charges to 80 percent of its capacity in 40 minutes on a DC fast-charger system, the automaker claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p9w564eEFNYSTiO75nBgXdsZcbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189079/ahawkins_201221_4352_6489.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8-H4VurqgRLRYRDOHG87VHYqG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189078/ahawkins_201221_4352_6484.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJlohv"&gt;It’s surprisingly sporty for a compact SUV. The two 150kW motors in the front and rear axle put out 402 horsepower, 486 foot-pounds, and 330 Newton-meters of torque, giving the XC40 Recharge that familiar zippiness down any straightaway. It will do 0 to 60mph in 4.7 seconds, a couple of tenths slower than the Polestar 2. I actually found the acceleration to be more impressive than the 333 hp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175017/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-first-drive-specs-review"&gt;Ford Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, which I had the chance to drive only a few days prior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrwumH"&gt;What a world to live in, where an electric Volvo somehow feels more powerful than an EV named after Ford’s iconic pony car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0cR43"&gt;Unlike the Mach-E, though, Volvo only has one driving mode, which speaks to the commitment to simplicity. If one-pedal driving isn’t to your liking, you can toggle through a couple of screens to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfUyfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What a world to live in, where an electric Volvo somehow feels more powerful than an EV named after Ford’s iconic pony car!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd6YbT"&gt;Inside, the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel comes in three modes, including a minimalist “calm” mode with only crucial information, “navi” for full-screen maps and navigation, and “car centric” for help using the car’s driver assist function. The ability to view full-screen maps in the “navi” setting is a definite upgrade over previous Volvo vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJzvMr"&gt;I appreciated Volvo’s decision to eschew the oversized main touchscreen in favor of a more modest 9.3-inch display. The screen is divided into four quadrants, or “tiles,” which is similar to other Volvos running the automaker’s Sensus operating system. The difference here is the XC40 Recharge’s display is powered internally by Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6BIgf"&gt;Again, shouts to Volvo for having the prescience to team up with Google for its first electric vehicles. The inclusion of Android Automotive gives the XC40 Recharge a definite advantage over other electric crossovers in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D46pVKE1aNNTbAr4tMHTpc0lcXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189082/ahawkins_201221_4352_6522.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orIXST"&gt;Not only is it easy to use, but it should reduce driver distraction as well. Being able to toggle between the directions, temperature, and Spotify while keeping my eyes on a road made me a better driver and reduced the likelihood that I’d swerve or let my attention wander. Smartphones and digital infotainment systems that invite a lot of scrolling or tapping are obvious distractions, and tech companies need to come up with better ways to mitigate that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMaiPC"&gt;It’s also demonstrably better than non-native Android Auto, which just mirrors your smartphone’s display on the main infotainment screen. &lt;a href="https://www.iamroadsmart.com/campaign-pages/end-customer-campaigns/infotainment"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that despite their simplified controls, drivers who are using Android Auto to select music are more distracted than drivers under the influence of marijuana or alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eqtgl7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an extension of Volvo’s reputation for safety&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vbySg"&gt;It’s an extension of Volvo’s reputation for safety, which encompasses other aspects of the XC40 Recharge’s design. The battery pack, for example, is encased in a neon orange aluminum case that Volvo is calling “a safety cage.” Embedded in the middle of the car’s body, the safety cage creates a built-in crumple zone around the battery. Leave it to Volvo to put as much thought into keeping passengers safe as it does its drivetrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ymwEfe"&gt;Volvo kicked off production of the XC40 Recharge in October, almost a full year after the vehicle was first introduced, and customers will start taking delivery before the end of the year. Volvo’s suggested price is $53,990 (not including the $7,500 federal tax credit), which isn’t cheap, but feels right for the XC40 Recharge’s impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop will reportedly accept Cyberpunk 2077 returns, even if you’ve opened the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zE5JUuAHYKPvpTJ88MBTYBedKdQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567225/Cyberpunk2077_Power_in_your_hands_RGB_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mphfBE"&gt;GameStop reportedly sent a memo to employees telling them to accept returns of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, even in the event the physical game box has already been opened, according &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/source-gamestop-now-accepting-returns-of-defective-c-1845930739"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patrickklepek/status/1341134244437962753"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; reporter Patrick Klepek&lt;/a&gt;. GameStop’s &lt;a href="https://care.gamestop.com/store-return-policy"&gt;return policy&lt;/a&gt; typically doesn’t let you return opened games, but GameStop seems to be making an exception for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; after its buggy launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR4sbw"&gt;You can return PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of game within 30 days of purchase to get a refund, reports &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;. GameStop didn’t reply to a request for comment, but employees at GameStops in Chicago and Houston confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone that their stores were accepting returns of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g310zr"&gt;Other retailers have also offered refunds of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. Best Buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189238/best-buy-cyberpunk-2077-returns-cd-projekt-red-refund-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;accepted physical returns&lt;/a&gt; of the game until December 21st, and the game’s developer, CD Projekt Red, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189322/cyberpunk-2077-refund-cd-projekt-red-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;promised refunds&lt;/a&gt; for retail copies of the game “out of our own pocket if necessary” if players submitted a refund request by December 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcnHmE"&gt;Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;offering refunds&lt;/a&gt; of the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; bought through the PlayStation Store, and it has even taken the extraordinary step of delisting it “until further notice.” Microsoft is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;offering refunds&lt;/a&gt; of digital copies of the game from the Microsoft Store, though players can still buy it. However, there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189918/cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-store-listing-warning-label"&gt;is a warning&lt;/a&gt; on the game’s listing noting that players “may experience performance issues” on Xbox One until the game is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Toss a Coin to your Witcher’ is even catchier broken down into different languages </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Witcher" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NsZ4hChfh5X4nwO4y5oCcB0cKD4=/0x3:6016x4014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567072/GRADED_Witcher_101_Unit_04997_RT.f3gcqwb7f.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k6v6rS"&gt;Remember this time last year, when everyday didn’t bring with it a new horror and people just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;wanted to talk about &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Well, now a new video from Netflix is trying to bring back some of that energy, piecing together lyrics from the show’s breakout song, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/12/30/21042791/netflix-toss-a-coin-to-your-witcher-song-hit-streaming-spotify-apple-music-why"&gt;“Toss a Coin to your Witcher,”&lt;/a&gt; all sung in different languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7SqkW"&gt;In the video, the song jumps between languages, starting with English before leading into Polish, Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and more. It’s incredibly charming, with all the different Jaskiers coming together to remind various townspeople and locals to toss a coin to their Witcher. It’s the holiday season; not tipping at least 20 percent, especially in areas with heavy snowfall and grotesque monsters that demand a Witcher to slay them, is simply unacceptable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajH5mo"&gt;Look, I’m a sucker for these types of videos. Remember when Disney released a version of “Into the Unknown” from &lt;em&gt;Frozen 2 &lt;/em&gt;that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/13/21020823/frozen-2-into-the-unknown-languages-multilingual-versions"&gt;consisted of 29 different languages&lt;/a&gt;? So much better than the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp-CVYGEsjg"&gt;Panic! At The Disco cover&lt;/a&gt; (which I, unfortunately, also loved because I’m a sucker for a pop punk band that inspires nostalgia). Disney also brought a number of different actresses to the 2020 Oscars to perform “Into the Unknown” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWtEPuP1YH4"&gt;alongside star Idina Menzel&lt;/a&gt; in their own languages, and it was wonderful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biwUhb"&gt;There is one warning I should include, though: if you listen to the version of “Toss a Coin to your Witcher” above, be prepared to have it stuck in your head all day. I’m currently listening to my favorite version of the song that was released last December! I’ll share it below as a holiday treat for us all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W7NKWE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDtu2r8mYIw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePzJM3"&gt;If you’ve ever wondered how profanity actually became profane, Nicolas Cage is here to help you out. The actor is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zySHepF04c&amp;amp;t=45s"&gt;no stranger to swearing&lt;/a&gt;, but in Netflix’s upcoming show &lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words &lt;/em&gt;he’ll be doing it in a more educational way. Though, if the trailer’s indicative of what the show is going to be like, it’ll still be&lt;em&gt; very&lt;/em&gt; entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzUPZv"&gt;It opens with Cage standing up and just screaming “fuck,” likely a reference to him doing pretty much &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve88BGz0nPc"&gt;the exact same thing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Deadfall&lt;/em&gt;. It only gets better from there, explaining that apparently the word is an acronym (standing for Fornication Under Consent of the King), and delving into how swear words are understood by the people using and hearing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N7g8Fg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The show will include celebrity interviews and, of course, a lot of swearing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLyUKd"&gt;As someone who’s always been interested in how regular words came to be (TED-Ed has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWbu2Kh1S6Q&amp;amp;list=PLJicmE8fK0EjR_iVOzgiJfvRuDPqKlPQt"&gt;great series called &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of Vernacular&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;if that’s an interest you share), it’s exciting to see a bigger production that goes into the etymology and social implications of swearing. Especially since it seems like it will also be going into the backlash to swearing — the trailer includes a part talking about those Parental Advisory stickers from back when CDs were a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyj8tl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only production Nicolas Cage has been involved with recently — if you can think back to the beginning of this decade-long year, you may remember Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;taking the internet by storm&lt;/a&gt;. Well, there’s going to be a scripted dramatized adaptation of it coming to Amazon, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amazon-lands-nicolas-cage-led-joe-exotic-drama"&gt;of course Cage will be playing Joe Exotic&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, it’s unclear when that will be coming out, but I don’t think it’s the kind of show that will fly under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4sZMN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;though&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is coming to Netflix on January 5th. It &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/nicolas-cage-history-of-swear-words-netflix-1234849387/"&gt;will be six episodes long&lt;/a&gt; and include Cage interviewing various celebrities and etymologists (people who study words), including Open Mike Eagle, Nick Offerman, and Sarah Silverman. It will also, of course, include a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbI0pX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now play Microsoft’s Flight Simulator in VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Flight Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olH1WtD2ptychuiWURMZH1WjXM4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68566403/DayandNight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8y3Wiw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has always been about making you feel like a pilot, but you’ve never been able to experience it in VR — until today. &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/22/microsoft-flight-simulator-virtual-reality-update-available-now/"&gt;With today’s free update&lt;/a&gt;, Asobo Studio has added support for &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-pc-vr-release-date-quest-2-link/"&gt;OpenXR-compatible headsets&lt;/a&gt;, which include Windows Mixed Reality headsets as well as the Valve Index, HTC Vive, and the Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest (if you use &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-link-usb-2-0-tether-quest-charging-cable/"&gt;a Link cable&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6C8NU"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/07/30/microsoft-flight-simulator-steam-track-ir-and-vr-support/"&gt;originally announced&lt;/a&gt; that the VR feature would be coming first to the HP Reverb G2. This latest update includes support for most Windows Mixed Reality headsets, Oculus, Valve, and HTC headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLpIGR"&gt;Before, if you wanted to feel like you were &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; in an airplane while playing &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, it would take a lot of computer monitors and some carpentry skills. Even then, you could only make your surroundings look like the cockpit of a single model of airplane. Now all you’ll need is a VR headset — oh, and a powerful computer to run it at a resolution that’s passable for screens an inch from your eyes. When Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499518/microsoft-flight-simulator-vr-closed-open-beta-test-sign-up"&gt;ran a beta test of the feature&lt;/a&gt;, an i5-8400 or Ryzen 5 1500X paired with a GTX 1080 &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-vr-support-closed-beta/"&gt;were listed as the &lt;em&gt;minimum &lt;/em&gt;specs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XdsX6l"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtfx_rF16Yc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVhhlu"&gt;The update is also giving the world &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-snow/"&gt;a winter makeover&lt;/a&gt;, adding snow and ice to the variety of weather conditions in the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403769/hurricane-laura-microsoft-flight-simulator"&gt;real-time weather simulation&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/17/microsoft-flight-simulator-is-fastest-growing-entry-in-the-series-with-over-2-million-players-to-date/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; by the head of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, the game will now “add real-time snow and true-to-life ice coverage to the entire planet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jfKRm"&gt;Currently, flying over the North Pole in the game &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-tips-hacks/index.html"&gt;gets a bit weird&lt;/a&gt;, not least of which because it’s all water with no ice. As you would imagine, in real life that region &lt;a href="https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/noaa-shares-first-new-view-north-pole-earth-day"&gt;is often very icy&lt;/a&gt;, so it’ll be interesting to see if the new weather conditions will make this area more true to life. In fact, let’s go see for ourselves. We’ll be departing as soon as everyone turns their phones off. And the runway clears. And, of course, we’ve got to de-ice the wings now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWXAwT"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out VR, the default keyboard shortcut for turning it on is Ctrl+Tab. If you’re using a customized keyboard mapping, you’ll have to check in the settings, where there will be a new VR tab. There’s a full FAQ &lt;a href="https://forums.flightsimulator.com/t/read-first-vr-faq/336918"&gt;for VR mode on the Flight Simulator forum.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SVQ7IW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft Flight Simulator is coming to next-gen Xbox consoles next summer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168892/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-release-date-announced"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6yjAmM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 22, 12:54 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added a link to the FAQ on the Flight Simulator forum with instructions on how to get into VR mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram creators were promised a $500 sponsorship but ended up with $40 face scrubbers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aE9mTm5jNvytgL9YKCNfxJ1nYfw=/0x400:2400x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68566290/Photo_12_12_2020__15_13_52__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lauren Clitheroe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7P1It"&gt;All of the women tell the same story of how they were scammed. A company called The SkinGlo emailed them with &lt;a href="https://theskinglo.com/pages/partnership-terms-conditions"&gt;a tempting deal&lt;/a&gt;: it was looking for content to fill its Instagram feed, and its team had chosen them to help. In exchange for five photos of them using The SkinGlo’s electric face scrubber — even photos taken just from their phones — they’d receive €450, or about $525 USD. They could even watermark the images and only send over a clean file once they got paid. It seemed like a good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgIHJJ"&gt;There was one small catch, though. The women would have to buy the company’s face scrubber themselves, with a 50 percent off discount code, bringing the total to €40, or about $48.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKlGtP"&gt;Although that stipulation was slightly odd, the company still seemed trustworthy, the women say. It has a &lt;a href="https://theskinglo.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; that’s basic but colorful and clean. Its Instagram page has over 12K followers, and at one point, it was filled with tons of positive comments on its posts. One woman says the page even talked about a partnership with ASOS, a popular apparel retailer, and linked out to its page. Seven women tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they bought the scrubber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BePD0U"&gt;That’s when the company ghosted. After taking and sending photos, none of the women heard from The SkinGlo again. Nothing’s been posted to its account since October, and all comments are disabled. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; messaged seven women who confirmed they weren’t paid, although the scam’s scale is unclear, as is how the company found their accounts. We’ve reached out to The SkinGlo for comment and haven’t heard back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HPIEVo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eXC-JpoyPrk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VYfB2d"&gt;From these seven women, the company made over €200 and sold seven pieces of inventory without having to pay for marketing, advertising, or comped products. All the people behind SkinGlo had to do was send some emails and correspond a few times with the women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNVTsN"&gt;“The fact that they’re asking for payment, it’s just a way to guarantee that they’re getting money in their pockets rather than supporting the creative side of doing the work for them, really,” says Lauren Clitheroe, a photographer who made &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXC-JpoyPrk"&gt;a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt; about what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e3MZL"&gt;This scam did a couple of things right to convince the women to press the buy button. For one, a person claiming to work in The SkinGlo’s PR department emailed everyone instead of relying on DM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BmGysx"&gt;“The email looked very professional,” says Rachel Gross, an online creator who got duped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rCWXG"&gt;The company also sent over a link to a webpage that detailed “partnership terms and conditions” and emailed a contract that didn’t have to be signed. The company told the women that buying the product and letting the team know was equivalent to signing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpD6IO"&gt;“I said, ‘Okay, if there is a contract that makes me feel a lot better because I know it’s a legal thing,’” says Clitheroe. “They have to stand by what they’re saying, or at least so I thought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMUfbl"&gt;Another creator, Kristen McCleary, says her husband read over the contract and flagged some concerning clauses, including one that said the contract was beholden to the laws of Malta. But she figured $50 wasn’t too much to gamble to make over $500. The company eventually ghosted her, without even receiving the photos she took.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z19jwf"&gt;“It was definitely a scam, and I’ve not emailed them,” she said. “And I’m certainly not threatening a lawsuit for 50 bucks in international, Malta law, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; flex-grow: 1; justify-content: center; margin-bottom: 24px;"&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; margin-bottom: 6px; width: 224px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div style=" background-color: #F4F4F4; border-radius: 4px; flex-grow: 0; height: 14px; width: 144px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlhqy7FJ-v/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by 1 Black LA Makeup Artist   ‍  (@itsvagabondbeauty)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nwt2xp"&gt;The scam could have been worse, of course, but the women also lost hours of their time shooting and editing photos, as well as money and pride. Clitheroe says even more so than that, the company preyed on people during an especially tough year, which is unforgivable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nklj2t"&gt;“Myself and my husband, we both lost our jobs at the beginning of this year, right as the pandemic started, so we were struggling a little bit for a few months,” she says. “There will be people in that same boat because of the pandemic, and it’s taking advantage of people in a desperate situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSDwih"&gt;Multiple women have posted about the scam on their accounts, where others then chime in that the same thing happened to them. There are nearly 20 reports on &lt;a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/theskinglo.com"&gt;Trustpilot&lt;/a&gt;, a website that collects user reviews, warning people not to collaborate with the brand. One poster, from yesterday, says they almost agreed to order the product but thought again after reading the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ySbbW"&gt;Gross says seeing the other women who were tricked made her feel slightly better. Generally, though, the takeaway for her is to not be tempted into promoting brands she doesn’t already love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcLa51"&gt;“I promised myself a long time ago that I would not post about products that I don’t like or personally believe in - I will not be bought,” &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIn5nNepAIX/"&gt;she wrote&lt;/a&gt; in a post about the experience. “And I let myself down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZeila"&gt;Although, as she also notes, the scrubber wasn’t so bad and felt nice on her face, and the photos she took didn’t go to waste. She still got a nice post out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Free speech’ Reddit clone Voat says it will shut down on Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NETHERLANDS-ANIMALS-GOAT-FEATURE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ARZQnLSXo44RiJKdSVoioreBeQ=/457x0:5500x3362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68566150/1229693282.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sw00Lq"&gt;Voat, an “anti-censorship” alternative social network that’s been &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/voat-the-alt-right-reddit-is-circling-the-drain.html"&gt;described as the “alt-right Reddit,”&lt;/a&gt; is scheduled to shut down on December 25th. Voat co-founder Justin Chastain &lt;a href="https://archive.is/0kOST"&gt;announced the pending closure&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, saying the site had run out of money after an investor defaulted on their contract in March. “I personally decided to keep Voat up until after the US election of 2020. I’ve been paying the costs out of pocket but now I’m out of money,” Chastain wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jm7sAQ"&gt;Voat was founded in 2014 and hosted Reddit-like forums with minimal moderation. It &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/reddit-users-flee-to-voat-after-harassment-clampdown"&gt;grew rapidly&lt;/a&gt; after Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/10/8761763/reddit-harassment-ban-fat-people-hate-subreddit"&gt;added an anti-harassment policy&lt;/a&gt; and banned five subreddits that it said violated the rules, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/10/reddit-bans-five-subreddits-harrassment-concerns"&gt;including its infamous&lt;/a&gt; r/fatpeoplehate forum. The site set a model for other “censorship-free” alternatives to mainstream web platforms, a category that grew to include Gab, Parler, and the defunct crowdfunding site Hatreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMjJyc"&gt;While these sites often don’t take an explicit political stance, they’ve attracted a largely far-right user base that’s incensed by bigger networks’ crackdowns. Voat also &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a3xmgg/the-epstein-scandal-is-giving-qanon-everything-pizzagate-couldnt"&gt;provided a home&lt;/a&gt; for the QAnon conspiracy movement after it was purged from most other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8QxGuz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Voat had a close brush with death in 2017&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AiDAeB"&gt;However, Voat faced chronic funding and technical problems, as well as denial-of-service attacks and an apparent &lt;a href="https://voat.co/v/Voat/3178819"&gt;warning from law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; about threats made on the site. Chastain warned in 2017 that Voat was &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/voat-the-alt-right-reddit-is-circling-the-drain.html"&gt;likely to shut down&lt;/a&gt;, but a year later, he &lt;a href="https://voat.co/v/announcements/2934082"&gt;announced a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with the unnamed investor, keeping the site online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVKGdh"&gt;Other alternative social networks have struggled to gain traction as well. Gab &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mb8y3x/the-nazi-free-alternative-to-twitter-is-now-home-to-the-biggest-far-right-social-network"&gt;migrated to&lt;/a&gt; the decentralized Mastodon network in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;after a mass shooting&lt;/a&gt; by a Gab user prompted PayPal and GoDaddy to sever ties. Parler experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;massive user influx&lt;/a&gt; after the 2020 presidential election, but its &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8gj5/even-qanon-is-abandoning-parler-the-far-rights-answer-to-twitter"&gt;momentum slowed rapidly&lt;/a&gt;. Voat’s death has been announced before, and it’s possible the site will pull through again — but its demise looks much more likely this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOa4ud"&gt;“Instead of feeling pity or vengeful, I’m instead going to celebrate the fact that Voat stayed up for so long. In my opinion, Voat is and will always be the biggest dysfunctional family on the internet,” Chastain wrote in the farewell post. “I love you all. Every single one of you. I hope you all have a life filled with overflowing joy and happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFRM1t"&gt;Later, after some users speculated that the site had been a sting operation secretly funded by intelligence agencies, Chastain added an addendum. “You guys crack me up, even now you accuse me of being Mossad or a honeypot,” he wrote. “Damned if you do, damned it you don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vimeo is becoming a standalone company after booming during the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="vimeo-live" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s99AMOd26TAnrnsXV1RbLq18ZjA=/43x0:496x302/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68565956/image001.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vimeo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yCHfYB"&gt;Vimeo is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/iac-announces-plan-to-spin-off-vimeo-to-iac-shareholders-301197537.html"&gt;being spun off&lt;/a&gt; into a standalone public company as the video streaming site sees rapid growth brought on by the pandemic. Since shortly after its founding, Vimeo has been owned by IAC, the enormous tech and media holding company behind Angie’s List, Ask, Dotdash (formerly About.com), and, until recently, the dating app juggernaut Match Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJze4E"&gt;IAC expects to complete the spinoff of Vimeo in the second quarter of 2021. “It’s time for Vimeo to spread its wings and become a great independent public company,” Joey Levin, IAC CEO, said in a press release. The spinoff is supposed to help Vimeo raise money to further invest in product and sales capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yvtQYa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vimeo is “focused on making video far easier and more effective than ever before”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VMZggw"&gt;Vimeo, founded in 2004, has long offered what is essentially a more professional alternative to YouTube. The site allows paying members to customize the video player surrounding their films, put password protection on videos, create custom sites, integrate with Google Analytics, and have multiple team members manage an account, among other features more likely to be needed by teams and professionals than individuals. Creators can also offer rentals and purchases of their films through Vimeo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogLaxt"&gt;The site doesn’t focus on video discovery and vitality to the extent that YouTube has, and its free plan comes with significant limitations, so it’s never achieved quite the same scale as its most prominent competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ku0p4I"&gt;Vimeo says it now has 200 million users (though it doesn’t clarify if that number is in total, per month, or something else) and has grown rapidly throughout 2020. “In the last 7 months we’ve welcomed over 30 million new members, seen over 60 million new videos created and uploaded, and powered millions of live events that went digital for the first time — more than the prior 3 years combined,” Vimeo CEO Anjali Sud wrote last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mBLxj"&gt;In November, Vimeo raised $150 million, valuing the company at $2.75 billion, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/22/iac-announces-itll-spin-off-vimeo.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Sud said the funding would help Vimeo build new tools for teams and enterprise users, develop richer live event features, and add integrations with more third-party platforms, alongside the creation of other new tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvrRZQ"&gt;“We’re ready for this next chapter and focused on making video far easier and more effective than ever before,” Sud said in today’s press release.&lt;/p&gt;
