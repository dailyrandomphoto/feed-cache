  &lt;p id="DBH7mo"&gt;The T-Mobile variant of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1600544-REG%2Foneplus_610214661821_7t_t_mobile_smartphone_frosted.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 7T is on sale at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; for $300, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-7t-tmo%3Ffrom%3D7t&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22203289%2Foneplus-7t-sale-deal-b-and-h-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;undercutting OnePlus’s own sale&lt;/a&gt; at $350. This matches the lowest price the phone has ever been, so if you’ve been looking for a flagship-specced phone at a budget price, this deal may be worth checking out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnqpQD"&gt;This being the T-Mobile variant, there are some caveats that B&amp;amp;H lists on its site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WStSqS"&gt;The OnePlus 7T is an unlocked T-Mobile variant. It may be used in other parts of the world; however, LTE access may be limited or unsupported, depending on the network. Please choose your country/carrier above to confirm the network compatibility of this phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGLcV6"&gt;This phone may also be T-Mobile branded and come pre-loaded with T-Mobile firmware and applications. The phone was originally manufactured and locked for T-Mobile, but T-Mobile has since unlocked it for resale. The phone is new and not pre-owned, though the box has been opened in order to unlock the phone. The phone may be used on any compatible carrier; however, certain features like Wi-Fi tethering may not work on other carriers. The phone is also dependent on T-Mobile for software updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Vqxk6w"&gt;If you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540535/amazon-motorola-razr-fingerprint-folding-phones-screen-protection"&gt;don’t like the idea of the phone having previously been opened&lt;/a&gt;, you can also get a fully unlocked version for $350 from B&amp;amp;H, or the T-Mobile locked variant for $350 from OnePlus themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUJkAP"&gt;The 7T &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20881638/oneplus-7t-review-specs-features-price-availability"&gt;was a good deal when it launched&lt;/a&gt; at $599, and has &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-7t-long-term-review-1164176/"&gt;only improved after a year of updates&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth remembering that you’ll be reliant on T-Mobile for those with this version). When compared to the market now, it does lack some features: it doesn’t have 5G, and it’s screen is slower at 90Hz &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"&gt;than its successor’s&lt;/a&gt;, which runs at 120Hz. But if you value savings more than those features, you may want to hop on the deal — it expires this Wednesday, December 31 at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After stumbling with one film universe, DC is trying for two</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/byvHL1FNyf9gBN9ekrhH3xaJoUE=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589439/ww_1984.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9QiVVr"&gt;There are about to be way, way, &lt;em&gt;way &lt;/em&gt;more DC movies — and some will be released as HBO Max exclusives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq0quV"&gt;Following the release of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;last week, DC Films president Walter Hamada &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/business/media/dc-superheroes-movies.html"&gt;sat down with the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to talk about the studio’s more aggressive release strategy. Starting in 2022, DC Films plans to release up to four films theatrically every year, with one or two extra as HBO Max exclusives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9gED9"&gt;Currently, DC releases about one or two movies a year, and seen mixed success. &lt;em&gt;Birds of Prey &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Shazam! &lt;/em&gt;failed to perform well, while &lt;em&gt;Aquaman &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;saw impressive box office return. In 2019, Warner Bros. also saw tremendous success with &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;— a movie not tied into the greater DC universe that nonetheless became an unexpected hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pt8siH"&gt;Under the new strategy, there will be two cinematic universes under the DC banner: the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and the DC Films multiverse. Films like &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;The Batman &lt;/em&gt;will exist as part of DC Films’ multiverse, which will be comprised of individual stories based on DC characters that do not tie into a bigger narrative arc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7ackat"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Under the new strategy, there will be two cinematic universes, essentially, under the DC banner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wrON4y"&gt;Movies like &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman, Shazam!, Aquaman, Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and likely future Superman and Green Lantern movies will fall under the DCEU. Wonder Woman and the gang will have their own stories and then come together in some kind of &lt;em&gt;Justice League &lt;/em&gt;setting again. This means there can be two different Batman (Batmen?) around the same time: Robert Pattinson can have his own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;adventure in Matt Reeves’ &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and Ben Affleck or a new actor can play Bruce Wayne in the DCEU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd46rm"&gt;It’s a familiar concept in comic books, where standalone series like &lt;em&gt;Superman: &lt;/em&gt;Superman: &lt;em&gt;Red Son&lt;/em&gt; can offer a new take on a popular character without affecting overall continuity. And of course, different universes can cross over whenever DC wants, like how Affleck’s Batman might &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299460/michael-keaton-batman-flash-dc-comics-warner-bros"&gt;encounter Michael Keaton’s Batman&lt;/a&gt; in the upcoming Flash movie in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WIMrR"&gt;If you’re confused, it’s understandable. In comics, multiverses play out over several issues and series, so there’s more room to get used to the idea. They also tend to work better on TV because the medium allows for longer-form storytelling that can navigate the intricacies of multiverse mechanics. As Hamada told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, no one “else has ever attempted this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDvhDa"&gt;“But audiences are sophisticated enough to understand it,” Hamada said. “If we make good movies, they will go with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFQOhd"&gt;DC Films also plans to release one or two movies directly onto HBO Max. These are considered to be riskier projects, which may not generate the necessary revenue needed to justify a $200 million production budget and another $100 million on marketing. They will, however, help bolster HBO Max subscribers if they work as intended. &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;notes that Batgirl or Static Shock are possible candidates for the straight-to-streaming treatment, but those aren’t confirmed yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoHWPz"&gt;The studio will also use theatrical releases to launch spinoff TV shows, which will stream on HBO Max. &lt;em&gt;GCPD &lt;/em&gt;will stem from &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, while &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;is a John Cena-led spinoff based on his character of the same name in James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. “With every movie that we’re looking at now, we are thinking, ‘What’s the potential Max spinoff?’” Hamada told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MT2Sdc"&gt;“What’s the potential Max spinoff?” is a fun sentence to read about a film studio’s development plans for the next decade, and Hamada isn’t the only studio executive with that line of thinking. Studio heads Kevin Feige and Kathleen Kennedy are employing the strategy with their respective studios, Marvel and Lucasfilm, over on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pAyFZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With every movie that we’re looking at now, we are thinking, ‘What’s the potential Max spinoff?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FW4zoB"&gt;It’s an ouroboros strategy: a never ending cycle of content based on popular characters and IP company executives think can drive people to theaters, then streaming services, and back again to theaters. Think of Marvel’s strategy: Doctor Strange as a character ties into &lt;em&gt;WandaVision, &lt;/em&gt;which ties back into &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;. The same for Yelena in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(theatrical release)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22151121/marvel-hawkeye-tv-show-cast-black-widow-florence-pugh-disney-plus"&gt;appearing in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(Disney Plus show). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM0L58"&gt;There are a lot of questions about how this will all work. What about Greg Berlanti’s Arrowverse, for example? And all those other DC shows on the CW? Will they just continue existing in their own space the same way DC Universe’s original series (&lt;em&gt;Titans, Doom Patrol, Harley Quinn&lt;/em&gt;) do on HBO Max? What if DC Films decides it wants to make a &lt;em&gt;Batgirl &lt;/em&gt;spinoff — do two &lt;em&gt;Batgirl &lt;/em&gt;TV shows just co-exist alongside each other? Remember when Jeph Loeb created an entire Marvel universe on Netflix, Hulu, and ABC — and then Marvel Studios &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2019/10/marvel-jeph-loeb-exit-kevin-feige-disney-disney-1202766184/"&gt;effectively scrapped all of it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="im037h"&gt;All we know for certain is there are going to be way more DC films and TV shows than what we currently have. Include Marvel’s ramped-up production on Disney Plus series alongside its film slate, and fans will be facing a sea of superhero titles practically every month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New Yorker report on the failed response to COVID-19 in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l9YisI9GDMrz9_UrV_XZcuB9EtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589274/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PM90VC"&gt;There are three moments this year that determined the scale of the COVID-19 catastrophe in the United States, argues &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; staff writer Lawrence Wright in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2021%2F01%2F04%2Fthe-plague-year&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22202867%2Fcoronavirus-response-us-failure-cdc-tests-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sweeping, searing look&lt;/a&gt; at the country’s year spent fighting (and failing) against COVID-19. The magazine is devoting an entire double-issue to cataloguing those missteps and the many other mistakes made by officials that set us on a path towards hundreds of thousands of deaths from the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gG4D7"&gt;The first happened January 3, when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), spoke with his Chinese counterpart about a new respiratory virus. Redfield wanted to send a CDC team to China, but was turned down. Instead, the CDC was kept out of China, and the agency was slow to understand the risk the virus posed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJAEDy"&gt;“Redfield is convinced that, had CDC specialists visited China in early January, they would have learned exactly what the world was facing,” Wright writes. “The new pathogen was a coronavirus, and as such it was thought to be only modestly contagious, like its cousin the SARS virus. This assumption was wrong.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZJqRV"&gt;Next came the problems with the coronavirus test kits developed by the CDC. They didn’t pass quality control checks, but were sent out to labs anyway. The failure meant the US spent the month of February essentially flying blind, with too few tests to know how much coronavirus was already in the country. That had a domino effect on other elements of the early response: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znTQmO"&gt;Without the test kits, contact tracing was stymied; without contact tracing, there was no obstacle in the contagion’s path. America never once had enough reliable tests distributed across the nation, with results available within two days. By contrast, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Fnews-desk%2Fseouls-radical-experiment-in-digital-contact-tracing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22202867%2Fcoronavirus-response-us-failure-cdc-tests-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to universal public insurance and lessons learned from a 2015 outbreak of &lt;em&gt;MERS&lt;/em&gt;, provided free, rapid testing and invested heavily in contact tracing, which was instrumental in shutting down chains of infection. The country has recorded some fifty thousand cases of &lt;em&gt;COVID&lt;/em&gt;. The U.S. now reports more than four times that number per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8GNnYZ"&gt;The third turning point was masks. Research showed that they could help slow the spread of COVID-19, but the CDC was slow to recommend them. By the time the agency said everyone should wear masks, they’d been politicized by President Donald Trump and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xv9na0"&gt;The C.D.C.’s sudden reversal, Redfield admitted to me, was awkward: “When you have to change the message, the second message doesn’t always stick.” Worse, when the President announced the new mask advisory, he stressed, “This is voluntary,” adding, “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="juCd6A"&gt;Wright outlines other failures: Trump’s refusal to direct federal aid to governors, for example, and the hydroxychloroquine debacle. He also touches on the one bright spot — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/12/22158376/covid-vaccine-pfizer-public-health-antivirus"&gt;scientific triumph&lt;/a&gt; of developing vaccines at record speed — but avoids any impulse to make the the scale of that success equal to that of the tragedy. Two authorized vaccines that are extremely effective at preventing COVID-19 within a year is nearly unbelievable, but more than 300,000 people have died from the pandemic and the toll continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDA7ar"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fmagazine%2F2021%2F01%2F04%2Fthe-plague-year&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F28%2F22202867%2Fcoronavirus-response-us-failure-cdc-tests-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s Mi 11 announced with Snapdragon 888 and 120Hz OLED display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAEq6xpraw7ojkKZx2URtoWIbOI=/0x0:678x452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589222/Xaomi_Mi11_series.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tA1G3"&gt;Xiaomi has announced their new flagship for 2021: the Mi 11. The Chinese variant of the phone sports a modified design and upgraded specs that give a good look at the kind of high-end features top Android phones will ship with in the coming year, according to &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16339/xiaomi-announces-mi11-first-snapdragon-888-device"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There’s bound to be some changes to the European and global versions of the Mi 11, but for now this is an early peek into what’s likely to be 2021’s first major Android flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaGmfR"&gt;The changes to the design of the Mi 11 in comparison to the Mi 10 appear minor. From the front, the display is slightly larger at 6.81-inches in comparison to the Mi 10’s 6.67-inch screen. That extra space seems to have come from shrinking the bezels of the device (always welcome), while increasing the height and maintaining the curved sides and hole-punch camera on the front. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M3vWuAnyO7kt4x45XeYG4-LjsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200423/Xaomi_Mi11_frontback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Xaomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xiaomi Mi 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KpmSyt"&gt;What’s more exciting is the 3200x1440 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate on the new OLED display, two features that have fast become must-haves on modern flagships, though of course they’re sorely missed on the latest iPhones. In another notable difference, the Mi 11 will also feature an under-display fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9GMNo"&gt;The back of the Mi 11 holds the more visible changes. The iPhone X-esque vertical camera “pill” of the Mi 10 is gone, and in it’s place is a thin glass “layer cake.” The Mi 11 features three rear cameras: a 108 megapixel main sensor, a five megapixel telephoto, and a 13 megapixel ultra-wide. The Mi 11 also has faster 50W wireless charging (previously on the Mi 10 Pro) to pair with its 4600mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzbC8h"&gt;Moving from the battery to the rest of the internals, the Mi 11 is powered by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and offers either 8GB or 12GB of RAM. Storage starts at 128GB or 256GB, which is unfortunately still generous in the smartphone world. Like most new smartphones, the Mi 11 also has Wi-Fi 6 and support for 5G. Notably missing from the Mi 11 is a charging brick. The CEO of Xiaomi, Lei Jun, confirmed the Mi 11 will follow in Apple and (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197394/samsung-deletes-ads-mocking-apple-charger"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt;) Samsung’s footsteps in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/26/22200610/xiaomi-ceo-phone-no-charger-mocking-apple-iphone"&gt;removing the charging brick from the box&lt;/a&gt; for environmental and cost-saving reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajmHSG"&gt;The Chinese version of the Xiaomi Mi 11 is available for pre-order today, and will start shipping January 1st. The price for the entry level 8GB RAM/128GB of storage model is listed at ¥3999.00 (around $611). Details on the pricing and features of the other versions of the Mi 11 will come at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen teases an electric car-charging robot with eyes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/19vCQWozKjfVdWJt0kyJowA8-Cc=/0x0:1515x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68589113/Large_12884_VolkswagenGroupComponentspreviewsmobilechargingrobot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Volkswagen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIi6M0"&gt;Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1452"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s made a prototype of the electric vehicle charging robot concept it first showed off in &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2019/12/26/vw-electric-vehicle-charging-butler-robot-concept/"&gt;proof-of-concept form in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and that it plans to keep developing the idea. The giant German automaker apparently liked the concept so much that the prototype charging robot looks almost identical to the concept version, complete with blinking digital eyes and R2-D2 noises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hkBii"&gt;The robot — which, shockingly for Volkswagen, doesn’t have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;garish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/6/14832354/volkswagen-sedric-self-driving-van-concept-mobility"&gt;cutesy&lt;/a&gt; name — works simply enough in theory. When you park your electric vehicle in a parking garage, you (or your car) can request to have the battery topped up. The robot unmoors from its docking station, hooks up to one of a dozen or so mobile batteries, which it then drags to your car. The robot plugs the battery in to your car and then returns to its station, ready to field any other charging requests. When your car is done charging (or you return from your errand), the robot collects the battery and brings back to the charging racks, stopping to let other cars and pedestrians pass by along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsVZ6w"&gt;It’s a fun idea, though there are a number of possible points of failure that Volkswagen didn’t address in the press release issued Monday. For one, the charging robot depends on cars being connected to an overall network of some kind (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233085/v2x-vehicle-to-everything-fcc-safety-spectrum-airwaves-wifi"&gt;known in the industry as V2X&lt;/a&gt;, or “vehicle to everything”) in order to communicate with the robot. But that’s an idea that has yet to take hold, and one that is fraught with unglamorous but nevertheless foundational problems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233085/v2x-vehicle-to-everything-fcc-safety-spectrum-airwaves-wifi"&gt;arguing about which standard to use&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Srf9Et"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMC1H__xL3Y?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zT2Zth"&gt;Also, calling this version of the charging robot a “prototype” implies that Volkswagen has got a working version, but the company didn’t actually show it in action as part of Monday’s announcement. Instead, Volkswagen merely released a “first glimpse,” involving just a glossy commercial for the robot and a few photos. Automated charging is an idea that Volkswagen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750154/vw-electrify-america-ev-robot-chargers"&gt;has been toying with for a little while&lt;/a&gt;, and while it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/6/9109027/tesla-model-s-snake-charger-elon-musk"&gt;certainly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/autonomous-robot-electric-car-charge-carl/"&gt;not alone&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the few big companies that seems to be actively engaged in making it happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCpnRq"&gt;Volkswagen is already building out large fast-charging networks in the US (Electrify America) and Europe (Ionity) as part of its larger atonement for the Dieselgate scandal. Something like this robot, then, might seem like a more complimentary charging solution. But fast-charging networks are not really meant for routine use; rather, most electric car owners will do the bulk of their charging at home or in parking structures. So finding a way to make that easier is a worthy goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tLYye"&gt;The charging robot likely won’t be the ultimate solution there, either, even if it winds up working well. Volkswagen is already trialing a different idea in parts of China and in its home city of Wolfsburg, Germany that involves putting batteries inside what looks like a more standard charging station pillar. This allows the charging station to build up a store of energy that can be used to fast-charge electric vehicles, even if the local grid isn’t otherwise capable of doling out that much electricity in one go. Volkswagen said Monday that it is planning a wider launch of these so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/en/news/2020/04/Flexible_quick_charging_stations_launch_in_China.html"&gt;flexible quick-charging stations&lt;/a&gt;” in early 2021. One downside to these stations, though: no blinking eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Detailed Samsung Galaxy S21 specs leak ahead of expected January 14th announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eg5CQ1iygFhoYlnpPISJzJlG8DQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68588992/42240.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Samsung S21 and S21 Plus will likely make a formal debut in a few short weeks | Photo: WinFuture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ax5maI"&gt;We’ll likely see a formal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 announcement on January 14th&lt;/a&gt;, but thanks to a raft of &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120248.html"&gt;detailed specs from &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and an assortment of previous leaks, there won’t be much to speculate about until then. Heck, you can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve"&gt;go ahead and reserve a pre-order&lt;/a&gt; if you like what you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ8Uvu"&gt;This leak confirms some details that have surfaced previously, like the move from displays that curved slightly around the device edges to totally flat panels, and a redesigned camera bump that melds into the edges of the phone. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; manages to identify a few new details though, including a slightly lower 2400 x 1080 screen resolution for both the S21 and S21 Plus, compared to the 3200 x 1440 resolution used by their predecessors. This equates to a pixel density of 421 ppi for the 6.2-inch S21 and 394 ppi for the 6.7-inch S21 Plus. Both will offer 120Hz and 60Hz refresh rates, like their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfKUBO4juUbzMyai4xc9GtzA5CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22200579/41789.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: WinFuture&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The S21 and S21 Plus appear to offer similar rear-facing triple camera arrays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ExzZkY"&gt;While a previous leak provided some detail about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189305/samsung-s21-ultra-spec-leak-cameras"&gt;S21 Ultra’s camera hardware&lt;/a&gt;, this one confirms more information about the cameras on the S21 and S21 Plus. On paper, the main camera module for the new models looks to be the same as the one used by the S20 and S20 Plus: a 12-megapixel 1/1.76-inch sensor and an f/1.8 26mm equivalent lens with optical stabilization. A 12-megapixel ultrawide and 10-megapixel selfie camera appear to be unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkcLSU"&gt;However, the telephoto camera appears to be different. It’s actually slightly &lt;em&gt;smaller&lt;/em&gt; than the sensor used by the S20 devices: 1/1.76-inch compared to 1/1.72-inch. Resolution and pixel size are the same at 64-megapixel and 0.8 microns, respectively. The telephoto camera is optically stabilized and looks to again offer 3x optical zoom thanks to folded optics, with hybrid optical/digital zoom available beyond that. Samsung also looks to have dropped the time-of-flight sensor from S21 Plus, as it did with the Note 20 Ultra, and it looks as though both models will get up to 8K/30p video recording (up from 8K/24p).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FeeUGj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S20 review: just right","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="T5a0UX"&gt;Outside of camera specs, the S21 looks like it will stick with a 4,000 mAh capacity battery while the S21 Plus gets a bigger 4,800 mAh battery. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s specs confirm Samsung’s Exynos 2100 processor for the European version, with the Snapdragon 888 likely to appear in US devices. The S21 and S21 Plus will offer 8GB of RAM and 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. And of course, the two models will include 5G modems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIocHA"&gt;Again, final specs, availability and pricing have not been confirmed by Samsung, but &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; cites prices of €849 for the S21 and €1049 for the S21 Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ow985u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48RDn1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fTjbw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T recovers from multi-state outage after Nashville bombing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Intentional” Explosion Rattles Nashville On Christmas Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTorug-xz_DIIUBjfWbyolXxHg4=/0x64:3885x2654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68588371/1293079213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thaddaeus McAdams/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9ClSY"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T says its services &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;have mostly recovered&lt;/a&gt; from a bombing that caused multi-state internet outages on Christmas. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/26/us/nashville-bomb-explosion.html"&gt;The explosion of an RV in Nashville&lt;/a&gt; injured three people and destroyed a section of the city’s downtown, including “significant damage” to a key AT&amp;amp;T transmission facility. This brought down wireless and wired networks across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alabama — disrupting cell service, some 911 networks, and communications at the Nashville International Airport, which briefly grounded flights as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATeyZA"&gt;The AT&amp;amp;T building, located blocks away from the company’s better-known office tower, provides a regional network connection point in addition to local service. The blast reportedly damaged the building’s structure and facade. Combined with water and fire damage, it disabled backup generators that were supposed to keep AT&amp;amp;T’s network functioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXDvFC"&gt;The result was days of partial service outages, mitigated partly by emergency cell sites. AT&amp;amp;T is also suspending data overage charges across parts of Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, and Missouri over the final five days of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ycvaqx"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T deployed portable cell sites around Nashville while rerouting regional network traffic and attempting to restore the building’s power. It reported on Sunday that it had restored 96 percent of its wireless network, 60 percent of business services, and 86 percent of consumer broadband and entertainment. As of today, “nearly all” consumer service had been restored. However, AT&amp;amp;T is maintaining 11 portable cell sites, and according to the company, it is still limiting power consumption in the building to avoid overloading its generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuhkYP"&gt;“We have begun to turn down portable sites that are no longer needed given the recovery of service,” said CEO Jeff McElfresh &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/pages/disaster_relief/nashville.html"&gt;in a statement on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, “but we will have resources standing by in the region as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYjc2k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/us/anthony-quinn-warner-dead.html"&gt;Federal law enforcement named&lt;/a&gt; 63-year-old Anthony Quinn Warner as the bomber, and they’ve reported that Warner died in the explosion. Although Warner parked his RV close to the AT&amp;amp;T transmission building, investigators haven’t concluded whether he intentionally targeted it, nor have they declared a motive for the attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVQIKs"&gt;Local news outlet &lt;a href="https://www.wsmv.com/news/fbi-agents-investigating-if-5g-paranoia-was-behind-nashville-bombing/article_952f937e-47f9-11eb-b1c3-bfda1689fb18.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSMV&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that law enforcement agents had asked an FBI tipster whether Warner might be motivated by 5G network paranoia — an unfounded conspiracy theory that has led people to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;harass network engineers&lt;/a&gt; working on the tech. But the tipster, a real estate agent who had worked with a “Tony Warner,” said the man had not discussed 5G with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSGiPU"&gt;The FBI &lt;a href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/crime/2020/12/27/downtown-nashville-explosion-terrorism-anthony-warner-motive/4055803001/"&gt;said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that it was “still early in the investigation.” Whatever the motive, the bombing shook a significant section of American internet infrastructure for days — even if it’s now largely recovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 65-inch 4K QLED TV is cheaper than ever at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OCBBnf6y_RQx5Wx7krLcf4_k-KY=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68588234/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThqcmF"&gt;You can pick up Vizio’s 65-inch M-series (model M65Q7-H1) 4K TV &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727833425321972223" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $580 at Best Buy &lt;/a&gt;when you’re signed in with a free My Best Buy account. Otherwise, it’s $600. This model regularly costs $700, and today’s offer is a good one considering its size and specs. Not many TVs at this price point are going to be worth your money, but this one stands out with a QLED panel that offers more accurate contrast and colors than a standard LED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7M1pd"&gt;It also has four HDMI 2.0 ports with support for FreeSync variable refresh rate (up to 60Hz at 4K resolution). Vizio actually advertises HDMI 2.1 support here, but review site &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/m7-series-quantum-2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rtings &lt;/em&gt;tested this model in-depth&lt;/a&gt; and claims that, even after a recent firmware update, all of its ports are limited to HDMI 2.0 bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiqF3k"&gt;Vizio has a large offering of TVs, and the M-series is one rung below its higher-end P-series televisions, which are generally very good. Vizio’s OLED sits atop them all, though if you’re on a budget, the M-series model that’s discounted today is certainly no slouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hfbt2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a9vyT5"&gt;The seemingly neverending deal on Apple’s AirPods Pro is still happening at Woot. Down from around $200 at other retailers, you can snag them for $190. We’ve written about this deal many times already, but in case it’s your first time seeing it, this model has only sold for lower once, during Black Friday weekend at Walmart for $169.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8qrWR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Office apps run great on the iPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fBrSIP"&gt;At Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08R7GQ4X3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 services&lt;/a&gt; for $100 ($40 off), and it includes a $40 gift card to Amazon. This is a family membership, offering Office apps on PC, macOS, and mobile, as well as cloud storage for up to six people for a year. Something to keep in mind: this is an auto-renewing membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE Axon 20 5G teardown shows how the world’s first under-display selfie camera works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SE8iGUcYuaSqb3Dwmvdau7kkTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68587923/DSCF7470.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A2L0tq"&gt;The quest to banish the notch from modern smartphone design has resulted in some pretty clever innovations, the latest of which happens to be the under-display selfie cam on the ZTE Axon 20 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgczhJ"&gt;The 32-megapixel camera hiding underneath the screen didn’t quite impress us in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our review of the device earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, but it is a worthy sidestep to the hole punch or the pop-up selfie cam we’ve seen in past devices. Now, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2J_5JnqQ8Y"&gt;new teardown video from YouTuber JerryRigEverything&lt;/a&gt; gives us a closer look at how exactly the Axon 20’s under-display camera works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8OXmQ"&gt;Beyond being just a generally insightful breakdown of the various components of a modern smartphone, the Axon 20 teardown shows us how ZTE is actually using two screens stacked on top of one another (a small, square, and low-resolution one on top of the selfie cam and the OLED top panel) to let the under-display camera peer out toward the user from beneath the top layer display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yW1AU"&gt;It’s a first-gen device, but it’s undoubtedly a signal of where phone design will go in the future, as companies aim to preserve the edge-to-edge display without compromising on notches and cutouts for things like selfie cams and fingerprint scanners. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYlKus"&gt;The first thing to do when you get a new phone is to log back into all your accounts — email, Facebook, Signal, and so on — to make sure you’re getting all the important notifications you need and messages from friends. But after that, you’ll want to install apps that replace the default tools (like the web browser or weather app) with something better, along with apps that’ll just make your day-to-day usage of the phone a lot more helpful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Es2sv"&gt;Here are our suggestions for where to start when setting up an Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AMlYH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178393/disney-plus-hulu-espn-plus-best-shows-movies-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175140/best-netflix-shows-2020-streaming-recommendations-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; some &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951428"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great sci-fi books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163667/2020-favorite-best-podcasts-tech-culture-apple-google-stitcher-soundcloud-spotify"&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting new podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IFe8Ld"&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Edge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CklyT5_vKOMom2hlb6NAp6LHbmg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175211/edge3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pRixjn"&gt;There was one thing I wanted from a mobile browser this year, and Microsoft Edge had it: access to the tab switcher on the bottom of the screen. Google Chrome and Samsung Internet both require you to to move your hand to the very top corner of the screen when you want to change to another tab. Edge’s placement of the tab switcher at the bottom is far more convenient to reach. It’s also just an all-around solid browser, with built-in tracking prevention options and quick access to features like reading the page aloud and finding text within a given page. (Since I last tested browsers, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefox&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt; has moved its tab switcher to the bottom, too, and it offers tab syncing from mobile to desktop, so it might also be a great alternative to your phone’s built-in, hard-to-handle browser.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nQHdBM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft Edge","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="IM9Rf5"&gt;JustWatch&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="JustWatch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NJKGFErukSqUR5uTgf_VJkAHtA0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175210/justwatch3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;JustWatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8I79ca"&gt;JustWatch isn’t a &lt;em&gt;great &lt;/em&gt;app — it’s really buggy and often very slow — but it is a necessity: the app is basically a TV Guide for streaming services. Want to know where you can watch &lt;em&gt;A Christmas Story&lt;/em&gt;? Type it in, and JustWatch will let you know that it’s available to stream if you’re a DirecTV subscriber, to rent for $3.99 on just about any platform you could want, and to buy as cheaply as $8.99. The app can also recommend shows and movies currently available on the services to which you subscribe. It won’t stop you from spending an hour just looking through all the options, but it’ll save you from bouncing between half a dozen apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yZjDbc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"JustWatch","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.justwatch.justwatch&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="CO8W3w"&gt;RainViewer&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="RainViewer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJH7468qO5KsFIdUfDFNblQZk1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175209/rainviewer3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RainViewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cenvUh"&gt;I tried out at least ten different weather apps this year in search of a replacement for Dark Sky — the single best weather app out there — because it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;pulled from Android&lt;/a&gt; in August after being purchased by Apple. After all that looking, I only found one app that could competently replicate Dark Sky’s game-changing feature: providing accurate minute-to-minute weather forecasts. That app is RainViewer, and while it’s not great as a day-to-day weather app, it’s a must-install as a Dark Sky replacement. I haven’t found it to be quite as trustworthy as Dark Sky, but it reliably informs me when rain is about to start and shows a chart predicting how heavy the rain will be over the coming hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Sd9MUy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"RainViewer","description":"Free from Google Play; $15 / year for premium features","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lucky_apps.RainViewer&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="61ussI"&gt;1Password / LastPass&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="1Password (left) / LastPass (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjB26G8yvDqPvo_SbIyGVvgEtpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19537374/1pwlastpass.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password (left) / LastPass (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jlUh7V"&gt;I must have written this a dozen times on &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by now, and I’ll happily write it again: you should be using a password manager. It’s not really about remembering your passwords so much as it’s about security — I couldn’t tell you what my password is to Facebook, Gmail, my bank account, and so on, because my password manager made up strong, randomized passwords for each of them, and automatically plugs them in when I visit those sites. All I have to remember is my own strong password to unlock the password manager itself. LastPass is a great free alternative, but my personal favorite service is 1Password. I started using the company’s subscription family plan this year, and it’s offered a really simple way for me and my wife to share passwords to joint accounts. Just a heads-up: setting up a password manager for the first time can be a little onerous, but once you’re done, it’s easy going from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gOf0jA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"1Password","description":"Subscriptions from $2.99 / month","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://1password.com/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="IyOLct"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"LastPass","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lastpass.lpandroid"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zrsc7b"&gt;Clue&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Clue" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4sGPJRZLTaLsUISFtTpxTE8WpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19537469/clue2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clue&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4mwXer"&gt;Clue offers an easy way to track your menstrual cycle and predict when your next period will be. The app also lets you track your energy level, sexual activity, and other details that may be associated with your cycle. More importantly, the app has one of the clearer privacy policies out there for a service that’s going to be collecting such personal data. The company says it doesn’t sell users’ data and that “only a few people” within the company can access your information. Some data may be shared anonymously with researchers, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="HgTujz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Clue","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clue.android"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qrSu6Y"&gt;Pocket&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pocket" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYUwDlpPzenGNZIe7YZ53sB7Iw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175208/pocket3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4Of2Eq"&gt;I’ll admit that, in 2020, I found myself doing a lot less waiting around in line, sitting on the train, and just generally killing time by searching for something to read on my phone. But whenever I do need something to read, there’s no better go-to than Pocket. The service lets you archive stories you come across online so that you can get to those long reads later (because, you know, you’ll &lt;em&gt;totally &lt;/em&gt;get to them all later). I come across a ton of stories I want to read during work each day, and Pocket’s the only thing that helps me actually remember to check them out later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H1vFOt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Pocket","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="9nP2Dy"&gt;VSCO&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VSCO " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hkr2eQsO78qJv3qRHgvAmkDft_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175207/vsco3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VSCO &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QPX9ey"&gt;Every year, I write that I have a love / hate relationship with VSCO (enough so that I apparently was annoyed enough to not include VSCO on last year’s version of this list). But I’m back on board with VSCO again, so here we are. VSCO is the best photo filter app out there if you want to create vibey, filmic pictures. The app’s interface is still more confusing than it needs to be, but VSCO is your best bet if you want to quickly take a bland photo and make it pop. The app has a bunch of built-in filters (and a ton of paid, premium ones), and enough basic editing controls to make a picture look like the photo you wanted to take, not the duller version your phone popped out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bGAkA8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"VSCO","description":"Free from Google Play; $20 / year for premium features","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vsco.cam"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VHqjoH"&gt;Files by Google&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Files by Google " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XpdZ3zeMlFP1Cte4SQ4AayqFaVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19537378/files.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Files by Google &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRXHmg"&gt;Files by Google ought to just be built right into Android. If you need to see what’s taking up space on your phone, or find a recent PDF that got lost in your downloads somewhere, Files is the way to go. It offers a simplified file browser for your phone that’s organized around categories like images, videos, and documents, making it easy to find what you need and get rid of what you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Zt3wO7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Files by Google","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fzziNI"&gt;TickTick&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TickTick " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQpj6za-NJnMpp4Qin9H6drQuJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19537398/ticktick.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;TickTick&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wViOx3"&gt;TickTick is the only thing keeping me organized these days. It’s a free to-do app that lets you create a simple list of what’s coming up on your schedule. The app supports natural language event entry, so you can just type in “Coffee meeting Monday at 8AM” and it’ll automatically schedule a reminder for the day and time; if you pay for the premium service, it can sync up with a calendar, too. Companion apps are available on Windows, macOS, iPadOS, and just about everywhere else you could want to sync your to-do list, so you’re set whenever you want to check in on your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PklGyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"TickTick","description":"Free from Google Play; $27.99 / year for premium features","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticktick.task"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Zmh3TI"&gt;Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outlook " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XXwiJcNlq2hxaGz72r5QFm4AGs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22175238/outlook3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Outlook&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="POQCaL"&gt;If you get too many email notifications, Outlook may be able to save you. The app has a “focused” inbox that tries to sort out which emails will actually matter to you, and it can be set to only send you notifications for emails it believes are important. It tends to err on the side of caution, so you may get notified for some emails you don’t care about, but I’ve found it to be a winner overall. I get alerted when important work emails come in, but my phone screen isn’t constantly filled with alerts about all the spam I’m getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="mXOgQl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft Outlook","description":"Free from Google Play","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.outlook&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="M2vnaM"&gt;Pocket Casts&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pocket Casts " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRSMBewo0EJbEnvYMMo6eNVTSrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19537381/pocketcasts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pocket Casts &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2mecR6"&gt;Pocket Casts remains one of the best (and best-looking) apps for listening to podcasts. Its focus on podcast artwork makes the app easy and fun to browse through, and the app’s discovery screen offers a place to find new shows you may want to check out. It also supports adding in RSS feeds directly, so you can listen to subscriber-only shows you might pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ciFtMa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Pocket Casts","description":"Free from Google Play; $10 / year for premium features","label":"Download now","url":"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&amp;amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;amp;gl=US"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
