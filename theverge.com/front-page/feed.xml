    <title>Facebook employees call for company to address concerns of Palestinian censorship</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dk6HOhkiTTQ-3pOxo1EIuWZW6uY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374670/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5TaWJr"&gt;Facebook employees are circulating an internal petition calling for the company to investigate content moderation systems that led many Palestinians and allies to say their voices were being censored, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/19da5f33-1c83-42ae-993e-27529e89e8f7"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes weeks after Israeli airstrikes killed more than 200 people in Gaza, including at least 63 children. Israel and Hamas have now reached a cease fire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRgwOB"&gt;Palestinian activists and allies have long accused social media companies of censoring pro-Palestinian content — and the issue has only gotten worse during the recent conflict. At Facebook, content moderation decisions are made by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona"&gt;third-party contractors&lt;/a&gt; and algorithms, and the process is less than perfect, particularly in non-English speaking countries. After Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/instagram-facebook-censored-al-aqsa-mosque"&gt;restricted a hashtag referring to the Al-Aqsa Mosque&lt;/a&gt;, pro-Palestinian activists &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/pro-palestinian-activists-target-facebook-1-star-app-store-reviews-n1268258"&gt;coordinated a campaign to leave one-star reviews of Facebook in the app store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcoTxx"&gt;It appears Facebook employees are taking note. “As highlighted by employees, the press, and members of Congress, and as reflected in our declining app store rating, our users and community at large feel that we are falling short on our promise to protect open expression around the situation in Palestine,” they wrote in the petition. “We believe Facebook can and should do more to understand our users and work on rebuilding their trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y68Lb2"&gt;The letter was posted on an internal forum by employees in groups called “Palestinians@” and “Muslims@.” It reportedly has 174 signatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVijy1"&gt;Employees are asking Facebook to do a third-party audit of content moderations decisions surrounding Arab and Muslim content. They also want a post by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which he allegedly called Palestinian civilians terrorists, to be reviewed by the company’s independent oversight board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlnCQA"&gt;Last month, employees at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441236/jewish-google-employees-support-palestine-letter-anti-zionism-israel"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; wrote internal letters calling for executives to support Palestine. Employees at all three tech giants said they felt executives were unsupportive of Muslim workers. Some also wanted Google and Amazon to review a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-picks-amazons-aws-google-flagship-cloud-project-2021-04-21/"&gt;$1.2-billion cloud computing contract&lt;/a&gt; the companies had recently signed with the Israeli government. Yet no company had as immediate an impact on information surrounding the fighting as Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgFn3m"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Facebook spokesperson said the company has committed to an audit of its community standards enforcement report. “We know there were several issues that impacted people’s ability to share on our apps,” the spokesperson added. “While we fixed them, they should never have happened in the first place and we’re sorry to anyone who felt they couldn’t bring attention to important events, or who believed this was a deliberate suppression of their voice. We design our policies to give everyone a voice while keeping them safe on our apps and we apply them equally, regardless of who is posting or what their personal beliefs are.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, the SEC has noticed Elon Musk’s Tesla stock price tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXtzlFIP0mRJcJ5NfTzIQU--TEM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374615/acastro_191204_1777_elon_legal_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NN4hiI"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission believes Elon Musk has violated his 2018 settlement agreement twice, according to correspondence obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-failed-to-oversee-elon-musk-s-tweets-sec-argued-in-letters-11622582765?mod=hp_lead_pos2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the SEC and Tesla. The agreement requires a lawyer to approve his tweets about the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bM6Vq"&gt;Tesla lawyers didn’t review Musk’s May 2020 tweet about how Tesla’s stock price was “too high imo” before he published it. The company’s lawyers also didn’t approve a July 2019 tweet about Musk’s goal to make 1,000 of Tesla’s solar roofs per week by the end of that year. The SEC sent the letters to Tesla in 2019 and 2020 shortly after each tweet, but has not taken any apparent enforcement action against Musk or the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lCI6yj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="leabS3"&gt;Musk originally found himself in hot water with the SEC in August 2018 after he infamously tweeted he had “[f]unding secured” to take Tesla private at a price of $420 per share. (He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-lawsuit-settlement-fine-penalty"&gt;did not&lt;/a&gt;, and had only held preliminary talks with Saudi Arabia to fund such a move.) The agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;charged him with securities fraud&lt;/a&gt; in September, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/29/17918252/elon-musk-tesla-sec-securities-fraud-law"&gt;two sides quickly settled&lt;/a&gt;. Musk agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla, and also agreed to have his public communications (aka his tweets) vetted by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOGAGb"&gt;In early 2019, though, the SEC asked a judge to hold Musk in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18240568/elon-musk-tesla-sec-contempt-of-court-settlement-violation-tweet-twitter"&gt;contempt of court for violating the original settlement&lt;/a&gt;. Musk tweeted an estimate for how many cars Tesla would make that year that was higher than the company’s official guidance. The SEC discovered that Tesla’s lawyers had not approved the tweet, and took Musk and his company back to court. The two sides ultimately agreed to more specific vetting of Musk’s tweets about Tesla, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;especially around production, sales, or delivery numbers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b76YGP"&gt;The SEC wrote Tesla in August 2019 about the solar roof tweet, arguing it was a clear violation of the amended settlement terms. But Tesla said in response that Musk’s estimate was “wholly aspirational.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM8dRM"&gt;“Tesla has abdicated the duties required of it by the court’s order,” Steven Buchholz, one of the SEC’s enforcement officials, wrote to Tesla in May 2020 in the letters the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; obtained. It was in response to the stock price tweet. Tesla responded that the tweet was simply Musk’s opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxnHm6"&gt;Musk went on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; in late 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/9/18133591/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-60-minutes-interview-twitter"&gt;to say that no one has been approving his tweets &lt;em&gt;despite&lt;/em&gt; the settlement&lt;/a&gt;. His public attitude toward the agency hasn’t changed much from the open scorn Musk expressed on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;. Last July, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1278764736876773383?s=20"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “SEC, three letter acronym, middle word is Elon’s.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oil and gas leases suspended in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZU9AIq"&gt;The Biden administration moved forward today with its plans to pause — and potentially halt — oil and gas drilling on the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Department of the Interior (DOI) announced today that it suspended leases that the previous administration auctioned off to oil and gas developers just weeks before Donald&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Trump left office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6Sxhz"&gt;Today’s decision follows through on an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-protecting-public-health-and-environment-and-restoring-science-to-tackle-climate-crisis/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; President Joe&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Biden made on the same day of his inauguration, which asked the Secretary of the Interior to put a temporary moratorium on all oil and gas activities in the refuge. Oil and gas leases will be suspended while the Interior Department conducts a new environmental review, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-department-suspends-oil-and-gas-leases-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued today. Based on that review, the leases could be voided or subject to additional restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3LYwLk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Legal deficiencies” with the previous environmental review &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7cYBmS"&gt;The DOI said that it needs to address “legal deficiencies” with the previous environmental review conducted by the Trump administration. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is home to a dwindling population of polar bears and is where migrating caribou return each year to have their calves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iztK4l"&gt;The Trump administration carried out a hurried lease sale on January 6, giving companies permission to develop more than 430,000 acres of land in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Facing heat from indigenous and environmental advocates, major oil and gas companies decided not to bid on leases. So the land sold for dirt cheap — as little as $25 per acre for a total of $14 million. The state-owned Alaska Investment Development and Export Authority got seven of the nine tracts that were auctioned off. The Department of Justice then rushed its antitrust review of the leases, according to FOIA documents obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/01/biden-anwr-alaska-oil-491498"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They completed the review in a single day instead of the weeks or months it normally takes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDP89j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Putting us on the right path forward”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xgeKDB"&gt;“I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognizing the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,” Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/biden-drilling.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/climate/biden-drilling-arctic-national-wildlife-refuge.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/01/us/politics/biden-drilling.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt; York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCaAJf"&gt;But Biden faces pressure from groups hounding him to do more to protect other areas of Alaska from oil and gas infrastructure. Last week, the Biden administration filed a &lt;a href="https://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/conocophillips_willow_doj_brief.pdf"&gt;brief&lt;/a&gt; supporting ConocoPhillips plans to pump more oil out of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, just west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. It also proposed a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-11496.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=pi+subscription+mailing+list&amp;amp;utm_source=federalregister.gov"&gt;rule&lt;/a&gt; that would allow oil and gas companies to harass polar bears and walruses in the Beaufort Sea and Western Arctic as long as they’re not killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJGZ2N"&gt;Outside of Alaska, activists are calling Biden out for not intervening in two major pipeline battles. Last month, a federal court allowed the Dakota Access Pipeline to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/21/politics/dakota-access-pipeline-continue-operation/index.html"&gt;keep operating&lt;/a&gt; while it undergoes an environmental review. And while Biden halted the construction of the Keystone XL, he hasn’t moved to stop the construction of Enbridge’s Line 3 pipeline, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356423/oil-gas-pipelines-abandoned-enbridge-line-3"&gt;first major pipeline abandonment and replacement project in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Opponents say thousands of activists are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nd-state-wire-environment-and-nature-business-5afd0c068906c4b9281e30a00a4e6268"&gt;gearing up for demonstrations&lt;/a&gt; against Line 3 this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s iX electric SUV with 300 miles of range will start at $82,300</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xy6_2Ko8A9eujrkH6cX9NnDvAog=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374293/P90422118_highRes.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SrL5vH"&gt;When BMW &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;first revealed its flagship iX electric SUV in November&lt;/a&gt;, we speculated that it would cost $70,000 or more, based on its luxury styling and upgraded battery. Well, we were right — sort of. The German automaker has just announced that when it goes on sale early next year, the new EV’s suggested price tag will exceed $80,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecTjxP"&gt;That puts the iX squarely in Tesla Model X territory and leaves open the possibility that it may dethrone Elon Musk’s falcon-winged EV as the luxury SUV of choice for consumers. It will also compete with the Audi E-tron, Jaguar I-Pace, and Mercedes EQC when it eventually hits dealerships in the first quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohQI5h"&gt;According to BMW, the iX will start at $82,300 for the iX xDrive 50 when preorders for the SUV begin in the middle of the year. That sum will get you an electric all-wheel drive motor configuration capable of putting out 516 horsepower for a 0–62mph sprint in 4.6 seconds. BMW says the iX will have an estimated range of around 300 miles based on the EPA’s testing model, which falls short of the entry-level Tesla Model X with 360 miles of driving range on a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WWbkfE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BMW is planning a more powerful iX M60 model for the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74CckF"&gt;But the xDrive 50 variant won’t be the only version of the iX for long. BMW is planning a more powerful iX M60 model for the future, with over 600 horsepower and the first all-electric SUV from BMW M GmbH subsidiary — though the automaker won’t say exactly when that will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iTkuI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; got to see the iX in person at an event at the Classic Car Club in Manhattan last month, and while we weren’t allowed to drive it or even take pictures, we can say that the electric SUV looks as compelling as it did on-screen in November. There has been some criticism of the vehicle’s design, mostly directed at the aggressive and superfluous blocked-off kidney-shaped grille. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiMMnL"&gt;But more than that, the grille serves as an “intelligent sensor panel” made with a polyurethane coating that can self-repair small scratches within 24 hours at room temperature or through a five-minute supply of warm air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sL8kco"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“obviously it makes no sense to have an open grille”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HgdtzA"&gt;Don Smith, product manager for BMW, said that while “obviously it makes no sense to have an open grille,” the automaker’s customers “want it to look like a BMW.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="escr6X"&gt;There were a handful of quirky design features that are sure to delight car shoppers. The rearview camera is embedded in the BMW logo positioned in the center of the tailgate. If the camera is obscured by mud or dirt, the logo extends out a few centimeters to reveal a spray of washer fluid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1zQ0G"&gt;The all-glass panoramic roof includes electro-chromatic dimming, turning from translucent to milky opaque in a fraction of a second. And the iX is the first vehicle from BMW to come with a radiant heating system, which brings heating on vertical surfaces such as the instrument panel, glove compartment, door panels, and contact surfaces like the center armrest and steering wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWlU0s"&gt;A lot of new technology will make its debut in the iX SUV, from DC fast charging capabilities at up to 200kW, to available 5G and Personal eSIM support. The single-piece panoramic glass roof comes with electrochromic shading. And the Digital Key Plus feature with ultra-wideband radio technology will allow owners to use their smartphones to start the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXJsrR"&gt;The BMW iX xDrive50’s fifth-generation eDrive platform uses a 400-volt battery pack with a gross energy content of 111.5kWh and a net energy content of 106.3kWh. That makes it possible to charge from 10 percent to 80 percent at a DC fast charger at 200kW in about 40 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e2hNGgZmIegZNbREkEr97Rc6Jgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551832/P90421824_highRes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SR1KNj"&gt;The curved iDrive display was impressive, with colorful graphics and very little lag when switching between menus. The version of the iX that was available at the Classic Car Club was only a pre-production model, so not everything on the display was final. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Brx6Bb"&gt;The rest of the control panel design is an example of BMW’s shy tech principle. Instead of conventional buttons, a control surface with active haptic input subdivided by feeler bars is used to select the iDrive menu’s other functions. And there will be a host of additional high-tech features that are commonly found on luxury EVs, such as augmented reality heads-up display to help with navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9yDVp"&gt;Along with the i4 luxury sedan, the iX will be BMW’s technological flagship, meaning it incorporates multiple technologies that will be featured in the German automaker’s upcoming vehicles, mainly electric powertrain and driver interface. It’s been a long time coming, and when it finally comes out next year, it will represent the start of something new for BMW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gdw2tn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The latest EV from Bavaria is a $55,400 luxury sedan with 300 miles of range&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1J1ip1"&gt;Months after revealing its first new electric vehicle in nearly a decade, the iX SUV, BMW is ready to pull back the curtain on its next EV. The i4 electric sedan is the automaker’s electrified 4 Series, with up to 300 miles of range and starting at $55,400 for the low-spec model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhbUHm"&gt;The i4 is built on the fifth generation of BMW’s eDrive EV platform, which combines the electric motors, power electronics, charging system, and high-voltage battery. The scalable architecture can be adjusted to accommodate vehicles of different sizes and utility — meaning it’s built on the same platform as the iX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZSygsv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the tip of the spear in BMW’s belated effort to recapture its early sales momentum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8VAIoW"&gt;Together, the two EVs represent the tip of the spear in BMW’s belated effort to recapture its early sales momentum. BMW fans were disappointed that the automaker never made successors for the i3 or the i8 in the years since those cars were released. But the company is iterating on the underlying electric technology. Now, that next-gen tech will not only power the iX and the i4 sedan but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17279482/bmw-ix3-concept-specs-beijing-motor-show"&gt;the China-made iX3&lt;/a&gt; (which is now officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171762/bmw-ix3-long-range-electric-suv-us-market-china-europe"&gt;not destined for the US&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Dpf9O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10527944"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSgRtC"&gt;The i4, which will arrive stateside in the first quarter of 2022, should be enough to make up for those lost years. BMW is making two variants: the i4 eDrive40 with 335 horsepower, 0–60mph in 5.7 seconds, rear-wheel drive, and an estimated range up to 300 miles; and the i4 M50 with 536 horsepower, 0–60mph in 3.9 seconds, all-wheel drive, and an estimated range up to 240 miles. BMW says both range estimates are based on the EPA’s standard of testing, not the European WLTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="823wU4"&gt;The battery in the i4 is made up of four modules with 72 cells each and three 12-cell modules. BMW says that together they provide a net energy content of 83.9kWh gross and 81.5kWh net. That’s more than the iX’s 74kWh power pack, which provides up to 273 miles of range. The i4’s battery has 40 percent more energy density than the latest version of the i3. The 398-volt battery pack is capable of 200kW charging capacity for high-power DC charging, which BMW says should take 31 minutes to get from 10 percent to 80 percent charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlV1nd3mxkxiB91YYjruMNyj3D8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551737/P90422899_highRes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6E04MlpSgWvNiB3CofoWEi6ptP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551738/P90422900_highRes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yb3xfklRHT24D8p3TAPdM3cWRCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551739/P90422901_highRes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5uuTyy"&gt;The i4 will likely compete with the Tesla Model S, Mercedes-Benz EQS, Porsche Taycan, and Audi A6. And starting at $55,400 for the low-spec model and $65,900 for the performance model, BMW’s electric sedan will likely make a strong case for itself. It may not travel as far as the relaunched Model S or long-range Lucid Air, nor will it have the massive infotainment screen of the EQS, but the i4 is also more affordably priced than most luxury EVs. And BMW is still eligible for the $7,500 federal tax credit, further bolstering its case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq8OP4"&gt;BMW is hoping its claims on sustainability and transparency will also help sell the i4. The automaker aims to reduce its carbon footprint for the i4 to the “lowest levels possible” through sustainable sourcing of the raw materials that go in the battery and the ethical recycling of the battery at the end of its life span. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CynYNB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BMW is hoping its claims on sustainability and transparency will also help sell the i4&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q90uUN"&gt;Driving the i4 is likely to be really, really fun, especially the M50 variant, which BMW notes will be the first purely electric performance model from its M GmbH motorsport subsidiary. Of course, the sedan will have the near-instant torque and the low center of gravity that is typical of electric vehicles. A launch control feature that optimizes acceleration will enable the i4 M50 to easily sprint from zero to 60 mph in a little less than four seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEv4xV"&gt;BMW also claims an ultra-low drag coefficient of 0.24 for the i4 eDrive40 and 0.25 for the i4 M50 — which is only slightly more than the Mercedes EQS with its record low aerodynamics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lSlti"&gt;The i4 will get the same curved display as the iX SUV: a 12.3-inch information display and 14.9-inch control display are embedded in a frameless, single-piece glass surface angled toward the driver. Naturally it will run on iDrive, the software and infotainment platform that has served as the centerpiece of the automaker’s in-car experience for the last 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/18UHZY5vkjiG2S093VPfA7gZdu4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22551740/P90423616_highRes.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fabian Kirchbauer Photography&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2eQHg"&gt;The brain of this car will also be a significant improvement over past models. The i4’s onboard computer will be able to process 20 to 30 times the data volume of previous models, or around double the amount of data that was previously possible. This will enable a greater fusion of the vehicle’s sensors, which will help enable higher levels of driver assist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lP4pmp"&gt;BMW has said that the eighth version of iDrive that will be in the i4 and iX represents a “major step” toward fully autonomous vehicles, able to support both Level 2 and Level 3 autonomous driving systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkPWqo"&gt;Advanced driver assistance systems, defined as Level 2 by the Society of Automotive Engineers, include lane keeping, blind-spot detection, automatic emergency braking, and adaptive cruise control. Most major automakers include some version of advanced driver assistance in their vehicles today. Level 3 refers to highly automated driving, also called conditional automation, where the driver still needs to be able to take over the vehicle upon request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nts8ba"&gt;In 2019, when it unveiled the iNEXT concept, BMW hinted that the vehicle would be outfitted with Level 3 autonomous driving, which means the car would perform 100 percent of the driving tasks under certain conditions, but that drivers would need to standby to take control when needed. That feature is absent from the i4 and iX, which is probably a wise move, considering the legal and regulatory morass surrounding Level 3 driving. BMW has said it expects both electric vehicles to support Level 2 “hands-free” highway driving, similar to GM’s Super Cruise and Ford’s BlueCruise features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jWT9Qx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BMW has said it expects both electric vehicles to support Level 2 “hands-free” highway driving&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NC9bk1"&gt;The front end of the vehicle features a unique take on BMW’s traditional kidney grille, which is just ornamental as it is completely blocked off. An active air flap control at the bottom of the grille can be adjusted in ten stages, allowing cooling air to be supplied to the drive system, battery, brakes, and air conditioning system in precise quantities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JN9KMO"&gt;BMW has a raft of new EVs coming out in the next few years, with the goal of achieving 50 percent of sales by 2030. The company is developing an all-electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345464/bmw-5-7-series-x1-electric-car-ev-plug-in"&gt;5 Series and 7 Series sedans&lt;/a&gt; as well as its entry-level X1 SUV. Earlier this year, the company revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt;production iX3&lt;/a&gt;, the all-electric version of its top-selling X3 SUV. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt;the iX3 won’t be available in the US&lt;/a&gt;, only in Europe and China. When it comes out next year, the iX3 will pack a 74kWh battery pack, which should power the vehicle for up to 273 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwEJYo"&gt;That means almost all of the German luxury automaker’s most popular cars will soon have all-electric variants. A fully electric version of the 3 Series, BMW’s most popular car in the US, has &lt;a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/new-electric-bmw-3-series-spied-testing"&gt;already been spotted in testing camouflage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="lT7ImN"&gt;Still, one has to wonder what took BMW so long to enter its challenger in the luxury EV space. The answer may be in the i4’s complete design. Other European automakers like &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/jaguar/"&gt;Jaguar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/audi/"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/cars/mercedes-benz/"&gt;Mercedes-Benz&lt;/a&gt; have tested the waters with more tentative EVs. The i4, on the other hand, is BMW going all-in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox gets a redesign with bigger, floatier tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIVBQ4Vz1zWZqIYYd4dvU-Ogr_s=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373967/fx_firefox_new_tab_design_copy_1000x562.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Firefox’s new floating tab design.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Firefox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p3SPUt"&gt;Mozilla launched a redesign for Firefox on Tuesday, and one of the changes you might notice first is a whole new look for tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVMKfW"&gt;Firefox tabs are now bigger than they used to be, and the one that’s in focus will float &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the toolbar near the top of the browser. In Chrome or Safari, by contrast, the tab that’s in focus looks like it is attached directly to the toolbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feIzYY"&gt;Here’s a screenshot I took to give you a better idea of what the new tabs look like.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ol8quSW5tdIYPjifqzge4cEwa84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552502/Screen_Shot_2021_06_01_at_9.39.36_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26t5nz"&gt;And if you want an idea of just how much bigger the new tabs are in the new design, check out this screenshot a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer took comparing the new to the old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V2u7E7_cJZSN1RRlD51iOgyD5Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553122/Screen_Shot_2021_06_01_at_9.27.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left: new Firefox. Right: old Firefox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DEwTgg"&gt;Mozilla says this new detached design was made to encourage people to move their tabs around. “We detached the tab from the browser to invite you to move, rearrange and pull out tabs into a new window to suit your flow, and organize them so they’re easier for you to find,” &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/modern-clean-new-firefox-clears-the-way-to-all-you-need-online/"&gt;Mozilla said in a blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77Qdgk"&gt;The new Firefox design has some other changes as well. Mozilla has cleaned up the toolbar to make it a little less cluttered, which you can see in the images above. I think it’s a nice improvement, though I wish the new tabs and toolbar didn’t take up more vertical space in this new design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdufM9"&gt;The updated browser also has more streamlined menus, which you can preview below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oufjoMa2_Rs20y2muxWDM6Tufq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552543/fx_firefox_menus_1000x562.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New menus in the updated Firefox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9D0rDb"&gt;You can get a tour of the updated Firefox — and yes, a look at the new, bigger tabs — in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czEGwcZSYyo"&gt;this video from Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDAz0J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/czEGwcZSYyo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get a refurbished set of Apple AirPods Pro for $155 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icssF2hsYNu57Gdsq7eFJwz7ASE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69370897/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg4sQS"&gt;If you’re hunting for a set of truly wireless earbuds that offer great sound quality, noise cancellation, water resistance, a comfy fit, and other handy features, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-pro-grade-a-refurbished-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished Apple AirPods Pro at Woot cost just $155&lt;/a&gt;. These originally sold for $249, but some retailers offer them new for around $200. This model is a “grade A” unit with “minimal cosmetic damage” at most, and with “like-new functionality.”  These are covered with a 90-day warranty through Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IZpMIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10504234"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8axf7a"&gt;One of the best leftover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/28/22453053/best-memorial-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-headphones"&gt;Memorial Day deals&lt;/a&gt; is on the 40mm GPS version of the Apple Watch Series 6. It’s for the model with a red-colored casing and sport band, and its price is &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to $329 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (originally $399). The bigger 44mm Apple Watch Series 6 in this colorway &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5P53JK?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $359 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. No other colors are seeing this big of a price cut right now, so check out this deal if you want Apple’s latest wearable without paying full price, and if you’re in love with red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oyzvlG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wC8PZC"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;latest generation of Amazon’s Echo Dot smart speaker&lt;/a&gt; with a built-in LED display that tells the time and temperature is $15 off. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can snag one for $45&lt;/a&gt;. It has seen a discount every few weeks since it launched earlier in 2021, but it hasn’t gone much lower than this yet. We predict that it will likely be more affordable during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which might be on June 21st and 22nd, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-27/amazon-said-to-hold-prime-day-sales-event-june-21-and-22"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tHxMG1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397064"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZBKOs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 1st, 5:06PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Amazon sold through its stock of discounted Galaxy Buds Pro, and Woot cleared through its refurbished AirPods that were selling for $95. So, we’ve popped in a deal at Woot on refurbished AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon did the math and would actually prefer getting sued</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zz16v_34HGBq1E8XyTpWSzOOGJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373842/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tI82Bq"&gt;Amazon has recently changed its terms of service to allow its customers to bring lawsuits against the company instead of having to go through an arbitration process. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-faced-75-000-arbitration-demands-now-it-says-fine-sue-us-11622547000"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company made the change after over 75,000 Echo users were organized to file individual arbitration cases, which would have left Amazon on the hook for millions of dollars in fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6rEjw"&gt;Unlike lawsuits, arbitration cases are handled by a third party instead of a judge or jury. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.adr.org/sites/default/files/Consumer_Fee_Schedule_2.pdf"&gt;American Arbitration Association’s rules&lt;/a&gt; (which Amazon was bound by in its old terms of service), the company involved is responsible for hundreds, sometimes thousands of dollars in fees when a consumer brings a case against it — and those numbers add up quickly if a law firm is able to coordinate large numbers of consumers to bring complaints at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LvDc5H"&gt;We’ve seen mass-arbitration happen before in attempts to pressure tech companies (often with the goal of having those companies drop the aforementioned arbitration clauses from their worker contracts). Both &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/ubers-arbitration-policy-comes-back-to-bite-it-in-the-a-1830892372"&gt;Uber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21135474/doordash-workers-forced-arbitration-william-alsup"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; have faced thousands of disputes from their workers. As consumers and workers seem to be cluing in to the possibility of using arbitration clauses to their advantage, it actually seems like Amazon’s terms of service change may be more out of self interest: win or lose, a class action lawsuit is very likely to be less expensive for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU4lIE"&gt;Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM"&gt;conditions of use page&lt;/a&gt; says it was last updated on May 3rd, 2021. As of May 1st, &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20210501194431/https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GLSBYFE9MGKKQXXM"&gt;according to the WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt;, the “Disputes” sub-section explained, at length, the process users would have to go through if they wanted to make a claim against the company. It also made clear Amazon’s responsibility to reimburse auditors fees for claims under $10,000, unless the claim was declared frivolous. Now, the disputes section reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VgH0Tk"&gt;Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Amazon Service will be adjudicated in the state or Federal courts in King County, Washington, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in these courts. We each waive any right to a jury trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cYYfIf"&gt;The updated terms of service also removes the requirement that users agree to the Federal Arbitration Act in order to use any Amazon services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjWZbO"&gt;That last bit about waiving the right to a jury trial may be unusual for tech company ToS agreements, but as an alternative to arbitration, it’s certainly been tried in other industries — though &lt;a href="https://katten.com/files/21691_Huben--Shopping_Center_Legal--CA_Supreme_Court.pdf"&gt;some states&lt;/a&gt; have found such clauses &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB109269232752592826"&gt;to be unenforceable&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmXddE"&gt;While Amazon’s customers may now no longer have to go through arbitration, &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/therecorder/2021/01/13/amazon-delivery-workers-ask-scotus-to-deny-attempt-to-overturn-ruling-invalidating-arbitration-agreements/?slreturn=20210501140812"&gt;some of its Flex workers&lt;/a&gt; are currently fighting for the ability to sue the company, despite their arbitration agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmT2"&gt;It’s also worth noting that certain consumer suits were able to bypass arbitration before the change — Amazon is currently being sued after allegations that some of its Alexas devices made audio recordings of minors. &lt;a href="https://www.kellerlenkner.com/9th-circ-wont-let-amazon-arbitrate-kids-alexa-privacy-suit/"&gt;Judges have ruled&lt;/a&gt; that the case did not have to be handled by arbitration, as the minors didn’t agree to the terms of service. However, Amazon’s change opens the gates for other suits to be handled in court as well, and it helps the company avoid expensive mass arbitrations in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rimac reveals the Nevera, a 1,900-horsepower electric hypercar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cMw12d07C93s2Qi-e3SCUi_GQIs=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373538/rimac_nevera_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rimac&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s3TEnp"&gt;The Rimac &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/6/17086808/rimac-concept-two-electric-hypercar-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;C_Two concept&lt;/a&gt; has evolved into a production-ready electric hypercar called the Nevera, and it’s still just as absurd as it was three years when it first broke cover &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17095430/rimac-concept-two-geneva-motor-show-2018"&gt;at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEAif1"&gt;Powered by a 120kWh battery pack, the Nevera uses four electric motors — one for each wheel — to put down an almost unbelievable 1.4MW of power, which Rimac says is roughly equivalent to 1,914 horsepower. The quad-motor setup can push the car to 60 miles per hour from a standstill in just 1.85 seconds. It has a top speed of 258 miles per hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C830U"&gt;What’s more, Rimac says one of the things it worked on over the last three years was improving the battery pack’s liquid cooling system, meaning drivers can use that peak power for longer before the batteries start to complain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mMbBBP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It costs a cool $2.4 million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7qmtjw"&gt;To make sure drivers have a fighting chance at controlling that amount of power, Rimac developed a new all-wheel torque vectoring system that basically acts as both an electronic stability and traction control system. The software can make “over 100 calculations per second to tailor the level of torque to achieve the desired driving style,” Rimac says in the press release for the Nevera. Braking in a car like this is also important, and Rimac has designed the Nevera to be able to dynamically adjust the balance of the braking force between the friction brakes in the wheels and the regenerative braking made possible by the electric motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W4Fn2x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10528863"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuyVM6"&gt;If that’s not enough, Rimac has developed an “AI driving coach” feature that leverages the Nevera’s 12 ultrasonic and six radar sensors, as well as 13 cameras to help “optimize and enhance the driver’s on-track performance.” It does this by providing track-specific audio and visual cues for when to brake for, where to turn into, and when to accelerate out of a corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZXkov"&gt;Of course, very few people will have to worry about whether they can properly pilot a Nevera. Rimac is only making 150 of them, and they’ll each start around $2.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWulER"&gt;A big part of that price tag is Nevera’s lavish tech. The monocoque is the largest single carbon fiber piece in the automotive industry, according to the company, dramatically cutting weight and improving safety. The H-shaped battery pack is structurally integrated into that monocoque, too, keeping the center of gravity low and adding to the overall structural stiffness. To keep the ride smooth, the Nevera has a double wishbone suspension that uses electronically controlled dampers, which also makes for easy ride height adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCfPao"&gt;Inside the cockpit, there are three screens: a driver display, a horizontal touchscreen in the center console, and a passenger display. There’s also an accompanying mobile app, which offers live track data, and the ability to download telemetry so drivers can analyze their performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vTP7N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nevera represents the culmination of a lot of ideas Rimac has worked on for a decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Crs7N4"&gt;The other part of the price tag is that Rimac will customize basically every other aspect of the Nevera hypercar for buyers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vxg122"&gt;No two Neveras will leave the Rimac factory looking the same or bearing the same specification, thanks to customers’ ability to choose from a comprehensive range of bespoke trims and material options. In addition to the company’s premium individual personalization program, Rimac will offer its flagship in various editions: GT, Signature, Timeless or the customers can choose to go Bespoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wwKcUp"&gt;Each buyer will even be “invited to Croatia to design his or her car to their exacting requirements,” Rimac says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVusZv"&gt;As if that isn’t enough to convince someone to pony up $2 million and change, the company says founder Mate Rimac will personally test each Nevera that gets built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuiewQ"&gt;The funny thing about a car like the Nevera is that it’s not alone. There is a growing stable of absurdly priced electric hypercars that can make nearly 2,000 horsepower. Lotus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696638/lotus-evija-hypercar-specs-price-photos"&gt;has the Evija&lt;/a&gt;, while Pininfarina &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251972/pininfarina-battista-1900-horsepower-faster-electric-vehicle-car-ev-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;has the Battista&lt;/a&gt;. (There are a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21167951/koenigsegg-gemera-hybrid-photos-specs-geneva-motor-show-2020"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395743/hongqi-s9-silk-faw-belt-road-auto-shanghai-2021"&gt;options&lt;/a&gt; in this class, too.) What’s made Rimac unique is that it really was a sort of go-it-alone effort, one that Mate Rimac built from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGJjRH"&gt;That said, Mate Rimac says in the press release for the Nevera that it “is the car I had in mind when I embarked on the ‘impossible’ journey ten years ago.” His company now has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/company/porsche-increases-stake-rimac-automobili-24-per-cent-23825.html"&gt;backing from Porsche&lt;/a&gt;, which is reportedly working with Rimac to make electric hypercars for the German automaker’s sibling brand, Bugatti. Hyundai has also &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/hyundai-rimac-investment-partnership-performance-ev/"&gt;tossed Rimac some coin&lt;/a&gt;. While the Nevera looks like a truly thrilling electric hypercar, the most exciting thing about what Rimac’s been doing for the last decade might be whatever comes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSBXZc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>World’s largest meat supplier grinds to a halt after cyberattack </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="JBS USA Pork Processing Plant As Meat-Pricing Probe Expands" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q1BWnAE8kfNBbnXMyDKxTG-ouSs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69373432/1219305308.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HyAb0v"&gt;JBS, a Brazilian company which supplies a fifth of the world’s meat, was the victim of a coordinated cyberattack, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-31/meat-is-latest-cyber-victim-as-hackers-hit-top-supplier-jbs?sref=ZOgFhNqs"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za98FS"&gt;Details are still emerging about the extent and severity of the attack — which became apparent to JBS on May 30th, and was disclosed to staff in a memo on the 31st — but it has caused some of the largest slaughterhouses in the US to shut down already, and &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/meatpacking-hack-jbs-ransomware-australia/"&gt;at least one&lt;/a&gt; in Canada. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, JBS has suspended its own IT systems in Australia and North America, though the company’s backup servers appear to be unaffected. Naturally, the shutdowns of computer systems and physical plants are likely to cause supply delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKL9Wj"&gt;In a press conference earlier today, White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre described the attack as coming “from a criminal organization likely based in Russia.” JBS has yet to disclose whether the attack involved ransomware, although the broad shutdowns are consistent with the effects of a ransomware attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLi7qJ"&gt;This marks yet another high-profile piece of infrastructure targeted by Russian hacking groups, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;the attack on Colonial Pipeline&lt;/a&gt; last month. JBS is not based in the US, but because of its outsized role in meat supply, the attack has the potential to disrupt global availability of beef and pork if not resolved quickly. As such, the White House has offered support to the company and “is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter, and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals,” Jean-Pierre told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
