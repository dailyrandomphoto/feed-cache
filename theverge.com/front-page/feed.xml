    <title>C by GE is getting a new name and going beyond smart lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9DiPDJK8F2WAP5T-00cvPZAOdY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68621484/Cync_Indoor_Smart_Camera_Lifestyle_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOOc3V"&gt;C by GE is starting to see some big changes. The smart lighting brand is getting a new name, &lt;a href="https://www.gelighting.com/smart-home"&gt;Cync&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s expanding beyond lighting to become more of a general-purpose smart home brand. The changes follow the sale of GE Lighting to &lt;a href="https://www.savant.com/"&gt;Savant Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a luxury smart home company, &lt;a href="https://www.ge.com/news/press-releases/ge-sell-lighting-business-savant-systems-inc"&gt;in May 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Duemc"&gt;As Cync, the system is supposed to get a new app in March that’s meant to be more “user-friendly and customizable.” The brand is also launching an outdoor smart plug, a smart switch for ceiling fans, and an indoor security camera — the latter being its first real venture beyond smart plugs, lights, and lighting accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNgd9H"&gt;The Cync Indoor Camera can record footage to the cloud or to an SD card, and the camera has a built-in privacy shutter that can cover up the lens. The outdoor plug launches in March, followed by the camera in May and the fan switch in June. Pricing hasn’t been announced. A thermostat is also in the works for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNGBqu"&gt;C by GE has been around &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/29/9634368/c-by-ge-lights-smart-bulb"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt; when the brand launched with lightbulbs that could be controlled from a phone over Bluetooth. They were a simple option for anyone who wanted to try a smart bulb without investing too much, since top competing options required pricey hubs at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJOvtp"&gt;Since then, the product line hasn’t changed dramatically — it now offers products that support Wi-Fi, there are more lighting options, and there are a handful of switches and plugs. The line’s transformation into Cync seems like the first step toward making the brand into something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo to acquire Luigi’s Mansion developer Next Level Games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Luigi’s Mansion 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hBKPsyWVt9RVsBbquN9JodWR8oI=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68620827/Switch_LuigisMansion3_E3_screen_04.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l1kb9u"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210105.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to acquire Canadian developer Next Level Games, a studio that has worked on some of the company’s major franchises. Next Level is already a second-party partner, meaning it only makes games for Nintendo platforms, but Nintendo says the acquisition will help secure internal development resources and boost collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZVx04"&gt;Next Level is based in Vancouver and is probably best known for developing the second and third &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt; in particular is one of the more technically advanced games available on the Switch, with impressive animation and physics. Other Next Level-developed Nintendo projects include both &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Strikers&lt;/em&gt; titles on the GameCube and the Wii, &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS, and the Wii reboot of &lt;em&gt;Punch-Out!!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t88SQr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Luigi’s Mansion 3 is perfectly silly slapstick comedy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ONyfFq"&gt;Financial details of the acquisition haven’t been disclosed, but Nintendo expects it to be a done deal on March 1st. Nintendo will buy out 100 percent of Next Level’s shares and says it should only have a minor effect on its earnings this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi announces made-in-India Mi 10i</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8OYlyo7lyHNPIIbrQ3INjBkMUm0=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68620790/Eqt5qQdU0AgyxZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VgXIzO"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mi 10i, a new phone in its 10 series intended for the Indian market and manufactured in the country — that’s what the “i” stands for, apparently. That said, it’s essentially a rebranded, region-specific version of the Mi 10T Lite 5G, which is itself basically the same thing as the Redmi Note 9 Pro 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A19cai"&gt;The phone has a 6.67-inch 120Hz 20:9 1080p LCD, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor with an onboard X52 5G modem, and up to 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The battery is 4,820mAh, and Xiaomi says it should charge from empty to full in 58 minutes at 33W. There’s also a headphone jack, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and an IR blaster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8vH9ucU3zrcqzwD0KlHXgoC2jHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214665/Eq8lDsjUcAE7u7o.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kxhjXa"&gt;The main camera uses Samsung’s 108-megapixel ISOCELL HM2 sensor, supported by an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera and 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. The selfie camera is 16 megapixels and located in what Xiaomi says is the smallest hole-punch cutout in its class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RER9aW"&gt;The Mi 10i will go on sale on January 7th in India priced at Rs. 20,999 (~$290) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The Rs. 21,999 ($300) model doubles the storage to 128GB, and there’s another 8GB/128GB variant at Rs. 23,999 ($330). At that pricing, it could be a strong competitor to the likes of the OnePlus Nord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Pixel 5’s system sounds are annoyingly loud, a new update may fix that problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The bottom speaker sounds much better than the panel audio speaker" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMHktbyx08GVw7s00Hkj9T3fFL4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619813/akrales_201012_4137_0151.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qGuqaN"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/91975505"&gt;January Pixel updates&lt;/a&gt;, Google might have fixed an issue that meant Pixel 5 system sounds could be a lot louder than you might have wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hm2Gb1"&gt;Since the Pixel 5’s launch in October, numerous users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jm8yzm/lowest_volume_on_pixel_5_notifications_is_very/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/jnpwhd/pixel_5_users_volume_issue_on_some_systemapp/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; and on Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77479730?hl=en"&gt;own&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/80874883?hl=en"&gt;support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/79219514?hl=en#"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; have reported that Pixel 5 system sounds (like the camera shutter or the sound you hear when you take a screenshot) could be quite loud, even when the phone’s volume was set to a lower level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzejQO"&gt;In the release notes for the January Pixel updates, however, Google says that the Pixel 5-specific update includes “further tuning &amp;amp; improvements for volume level of system sounds.” A few users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/kqg3q3/january_update_finally_fixes_the_most_annoying/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; have reported that the system sounds are much quieter after installing the update, though some say that the sounds are &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; quiet now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zG8nI"&gt;The release notes also list other changes, including improvements to auto-brightness on the Pixel 4A, 4A 5G, and 5. Here’s Google’s full list of “notable fixes” in the January updates:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hFpdfR_tgQW-vidQsK3Q_G5EsZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22214032/thread_91975505_11215868825490307245.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zj4vUP"&gt;Google says the updates are rolling out now to all supported Pixel devices running Android 11. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple temporarily closes all remaining Apple Stores in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store SoHo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWgBhl-RROkaqKXorEibrfKtJwA=/6x0:1020x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619506/apple-store-soho-nyc-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTS3xs"&gt;Apple has been shutting down loads of retail stores as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to peak — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22190895/apple-close-retails-stores-covid-19-london-california-pandemic"&gt;on December 20th,&lt;/a&gt; it temporarily closed every single location in California, Mexico, Brazil, and over a dozen in London. Now, as England and Scotland go into &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/04/lockdown-no-3-what-are-the-new-restrictions"&gt;a pair&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55531069"&gt;new national lockdowns&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is closing all of its remaining stores in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bw5Yx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/04/apple-stores-uk-close-again/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;’s Michael Steeber reports&lt;/a&gt;, that means 18 additional stores are now closed across the UK, including several in Scotland and one in Belfast, Ireland — though it looks like the Belfast store may have already been closed. (&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-54117810"&gt;Northern Ireland went into lockdown even earlier&lt;/a&gt;, on December 26th, shutting down all non-essential shops.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VMSjSW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All 18 UK Apple Stores open today will close from January 5. Includes every location in Scotland. Most of the other 20 stores closed just before the holidays. &lt;a href="https://t.co/RYfhWgNkrb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RYfhWgNkrb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Steeber (@MichaelSteeber) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MichaelSteeber/status/1346205814848151553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wKKPpW"&gt;While it feels worthwhile to note the closures, they may not make all that much of a difference for most shoppers, who already couldn’t physically enter many of these stores since November. That’s when Apple&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/11/04/apple-stores-england-lockdown-open-click-and-collect/"&gt; started offering express service only&lt;/a&gt; at many of these stores. You’d have been able to pick up online orders, but you couldn’t browse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teledyne is buying FLIR to create a super-sized sensor shop with thermal and laser vision</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4GWfyae328dV0C-5owXnSL6VEA=/129x0:1071x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68619175/flir_teledyne.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Industrial sensor giant Teledyne will acquire FLIR, an Oregon-based company that makes thermal-imaging and night vision technology, the &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal is worth $8 billion in a mix of cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuDXhu"&gt;“At the core of both our companies is proprietary sensor technologies. Our business models are also similar: we each provide sensors, cameras and sensor systems to our customers,” Teledyne chairman Robert Mehrabian said in a &lt;a href="https://www.teledyne.com/en-us/news/Pages/Teledyne-to-Acquire-FLIR-Systems.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. The companies’ sensors are “uniquely complementary, with minimal overlap,” he added, which could be important when regulators decide whether to approve the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZtl4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You probably already know FLIR&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cslfoO"&gt;Oregon-based FLIR makes thermal-imaging and night-vision technology for the military and for industrial and consumer applications — if you’ve ever seen infrared footage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/6/15743628/flir-one-thermal-camera-iphone-android-specs"&gt;there’s a good chance it was captured&lt;/a&gt; with a FLIR camera. FLIR also has some &lt;a href="https://www.suasnews.com/2020/05/flir-wins-20-6-million-contract-to-provide-black-hornet-nano-uav-systems-for-u-s-armys-soldier-borne-sensor-program/"&gt;$60 million in contracts with the Army&lt;/a&gt; for its Black Hornet drone, and its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fdiscover%2Fcores-components%2Fflir-hadron-enables-lightweight-and-affordable-suas%2F%3Futm_source%3Daffiliate%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3DSkimlinks%26cjevent%3D6abd03b34eda11eb837e00300a24060f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hadron thermal camera&lt;/a&gt; is used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;other Army-approved drones&lt;/a&gt;. FLIR also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.flir.com%2Fnews-center%2Fcamera-cores--components%2Fflir-to-provide-thermal-imaging-cameras-for-zoox-robotaxi%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213966%2Flidar-flir-teledyne-thermal-sensor-drones-nasa#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;supplies thermal imaging&lt;/a&gt; cameras for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;Zoox’s self-driving robotaxi&lt;/a&gt;, which helps the vehicles better “see” people and driving conditions, particularly important in urban areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kM2HC0"&gt;Teledyne might also have tech that’s handy for self-driving vehicles: in addition to making thermal sensors for defense and industrial clients, including NASA, it’s one of the companies that builds the LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors you might see atop a self-driving car. Its LIDAR was also used in NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission last October, helping to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540873/nasa-osiris-rex-spacecraft-asteroid-sample-bennu-storage-success"&gt;map the surface of the Bennu asteroid&lt;/a&gt; so it could collect samples to bring back to Earth. Teledyne isn’t to be confused with Velodyne, whose LIDAR featured in some of the earliest self-driving prototypes and in Google’s early cars, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Owcr2"&gt;The acquisition is expected to close sometime in the middle of the year, the companies said, pending regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEE1yO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wgIkVO"&gt;Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter and Square, isn’t happy about the new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Ffincen-letter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F4%2F22213863%2Fjack-dorsey-cryptocurrency-fincen-regulation-letter#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;proposed cryptocurrency regulation&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasized how the regulation would hurt Square, a financial services company, in a letter posted to the company website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soTiJq"&gt;In October, Square &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507533/square-50-million-bitcoin-dorsey-cryptocurrency"&gt;bought $50 million in bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has invested heavily in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, so Square has plenty of skin in the game. The regulations create “unnecessary friction and perverse incentives for cryptocurrency customers to avoid regulated entities for cryptocurrency transactions,” Dorsey writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0SkQIt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The regulation could end up driving customers “to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x50Dtq"&gt;The regulation, proposed by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), would require financial institutions (like Square) to collect personal information about the parties involved in cryptocurrency transactions. You can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;a deep-dive on them here&lt;/a&gt;, but the more important requirement is for financial institutions to collect the name and physical address of both parties of any large transaction they’re involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Caso08"&gt;The regulation aims to help prevent some of the illegal uses of cryptocurrencies, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/silk-road-1/"&gt;such as drug trafficking&lt;/a&gt;, money laundering, and “international terrorist financing.” But Dorsey’s major complaint is that they would create “unnecessary friction” between cryptocurrency users and financial institutions, which could lead to “perverse incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hOCgNF"&gt;To put it plainly — were the [regulations] to be implemented as written, Square would be required to collect unreliable data about people who have not opted into our service or signed up as our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yQgdWh"&gt;To use an example included in the letter, say a parent uses Square to send their daughter $4,000 in bitcoin. Even if the daughter is using a private bitcoin wallet on her own computer, Square would then be obligated to collect her personal information, including her physical address. Dorsey, &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;along with other privacy advocates&lt;/a&gt;, sees that as an overreach, particularly given the open nature of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4jR2n"&gt;Dorsey argues the regulation could end up driving customers “to use non-custodial wallets or services outside the U.S. to transfer their assets more easily,” leading to FinCEN having “less visibility into the universe of cryptocurrency transactions than it has today.” Put simply, if people have to provide private information to a bank in order to make a transaction, they’ll avoid using the bank — something the CEO describes as a perverse incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMd8Gn"&gt;What’s more, Dorsey writes, it hampers innovation. “The burdensome information collection and reporting requirements deprive U.S. companies like Square of the chance to compete on a level playing field to enable cryptocurrency as a tool of economic empowerment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNzA4o"&gt;The letter was submitted as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/us-government-targeting-cryptocurrency-expand-reach-its-financial-surveillance"&gt;unusually short comment period for the regulation&lt;/a&gt;. The standard public comment period for these types of policies is 60 days, but the comment period for this proposal is 15 days — many of which were holidays. The Treasury Department’s reasoning for this is due to “significant national security imperatives,” but it doesn’t provide any further examples. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Start the first week of 2021 with the Awesome Games Done Quick speedrunning marathon</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xOGkQp"&gt;Games Done Quick (GDC), the charity event series that raises money while expert players blast their way through classic games, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick"&gt;kicked off its first 2021 iteration yesterday on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and the event is running all week for anyone interested in tuning in to this year’s speedrunning spotlights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwzC33"&gt;The January event, typically focused on “awesome” games done quick, is on its second day and has some great titles on the schedule over the next few hours, including speedruns of &lt;em&gt;Dishonored 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin II&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/em&gt;. Later this week, we’ll see speedruns of classics like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mega-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. Check out the full schedule &lt;a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L5MZ45"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?channel=gamesdonequick&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yl7syX"&gt;GDC has been organizing its charity speedrun marathons since 2010, and this year’s event is raising money for the &lt;a href="https://www.preventcancer.org/"&gt;Prevent Cancer Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The event series is notable for its consistency, the rather sizable viewership and charity metrics it regularly posts (over $25 million raised so far), and the fact that it often features live world records set in real time on Twitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAbGNO"&gt;Earlier today, two world records were set in two separate &lt;em&gt;Sonic &lt;/em&gt;games back to back: &lt;em&gt;Sonic 1&lt;/em&gt; (by speedrunner flyingfox) and &lt;em&gt;Sonic 3: Angel Island Revisited&lt;/em&gt; (by Zaxon96). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $9 off its normal price, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f487a960520964ac860d89f77404bb1b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $270&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f16e9235da90ab510af5e23d08d74daf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280 for silver with a white band&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299 for gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b1bbcc98b9b514babd7b0198463cd917&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic Games is moving its Cary, North Carolina headquarters across town to a large shopping mall, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt;. It’s planning to convert the 87-acre Cary Towne Center into its new home base by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN2uQi"&gt;Once development is complete, Epic says the site will include recreational and office space, “customized from the ground up to accommodate its long-term growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCZmXf"&gt;The company says it plans to begin development on the new HQ site this year. Epic purchased the property from Turnbridge Equities and Denali Properties, which bought it in January 2019 as part of a distressed sale after the mall lost three of its anchor tenants, &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2021/01/03/epic-games-buys-cary-towne-center-for-headquarters.html"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Triangle Business Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Turnbridge and Denali planned to turn the site into a mixed-use development named Carolina Yards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ts5SQj"&gt;Epic’s plans for developing the property include demolishing some of the existing structures on the site, a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but the company didn’t offer any further specifics. saying plans are still in the early stages. Until the new headquarters is ready, Epic will continue to operate out of its current offices at Crossroads Boulevard in Cary, about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Cary+Towne+Center,+Walnut+Street,+Cary,+NC/Crossroads+Blvd,+Cary,+NC+27518/@35.7692517,-78.7568751,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf37095e4a5e7:0x39896f5137e1e57b!2m2!1d-78.7602778!2d35.7738889!1m5!1m1!1s0x89acf499dfeab493:0x58a15f123e5914fa!2m2!1d-78.7342361!2d35.7590385!3e0"&gt;three miles away&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POEqzw"&gt;Epic raised $1.78 billion in a funding round last summer and has a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/gaming/news/fortnite-epic-games-1-78-billion-funding-sony-1234727436/"&gt;valuation of around $17.3 billion&lt;/a&gt;. And even though the company is still embroiled in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over fees in the App Store, Epic’s&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; remained hugely popular in 2020, with more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249497/fortnite-350-million-registered-players-hours-played-april"&gt;350 million registered players&lt;/a&gt; as of May.&lt;/p&gt;
