    <title>Move over, SolarWinds: 30,000 orgs’ email hacked via Microsoft Exchange Server flaws</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DA37sYLrtMciQ45kYXShC58RVZ8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920934/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVJVnq"&gt;Four exploits found in Microsoft’s Exchange Server software have reportedly led to over 30,000 US governmental and commercial organizations having their emails hacked, according to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/at-least-30000-u-s-organizations-newly-hacked-via-holes-in-microsofts-email-software/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/"&gt;is also reporting&lt;/a&gt; “tens of thousands of email servers” hacked. The exploits have been patched by Microsoft, but security experts talking to &lt;em&gt;Krebs &lt;/em&gt;say that the detection and cleanup process will be a massive effort for the thousands of state and city governments, fire and police departments, school districts, financial institutions, and other organizations that were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNlXNi"&gt;According to Microsoft, the vulnerabilities allowed hackers to gain access to email accounts, and also gave them the ability to install malware that might let them back into those servers at a later time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCnRj6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krebs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/china-microsoft-exchange-server-hack-victims/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report that the attack was carried out by Hafnium, a Chinese hacking group. While Microsoft hasn’t spoken to the scale of the attack, it &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fsecurity%2Fblog%2F2021%2F03%2F02%2Fhafnium-targeting-exchange-servers%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22316189%2Fmicrosoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also points to the same group&lt;/a&gt; as having exploited the vulnerabilities, saying that it has “high confidence” that the group is state-sponsored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66Ncq6"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;, the attack has been ongoing since January 6th (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;the day of the riot&lt;/a&gt;), but ramped up in late February. Microsoft released its patches on March 2nd, which means that the attackers had almost two months to carry out their operations. The president of cyber security firm Volexity, which discovered the attack, told &lt;em&gt;Krebs&lt;/em&gt; that “if you’re running Exchange and you haven’t patched this yet, there’s a very high chance that your organization is already compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbLbRF"&gt;Both the White House National Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, and former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Chris Krebs (no relation to &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt;) have tweeted about the severity of the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmnADt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the real deal. If your organization runs an OWA server exposed to the internet, assume compromise between 02/26-03/03. Check for 8 character aspx files in C:\\inetpub\wwwroot\aspnet_client\system_web\. If you get a hit on that search, you’re now in incident response mode. &lt;a href="https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm"&gt;https://t.co/865Q8cc1Rm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Krebs (@C_C_Krebs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/C_C_Krebs/status/1367673471669526528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="trcEWs"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/"&gt;has released&lt;/a&gt; several security updates to fix the vulnerabilities, and suggests that they be installed immediately. It is worth noting that, if your organization uses Exchange Online, it will not have been affected — the exploit was only present on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1366943160572796929?s=20"&gt;self-hosted&lt;/a&gt; servers running Exchange Server 2013, 2016, or 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vsxGV"&gt;While a large-scale attack, likely carried out by a state-run organization may sound familiar, &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/02/new-nation-state-cyberattacks/"&gt;Microsoft is clear&lt;/a&gt; that the attacks are “in no way connected” to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;the SolarWinds attacks&lt;/a&gt; that compromised US federal government agencies and companies last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdjErP"&gt;It’s likely that there are still details to come about this hack — so far, there hasn’t been an official list of organizations that have been compromised, just a vague picture of the large scale and high-severity of the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svoMzY"&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson said that the company is &lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;working closely with the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency], other government agencies, and security companies, to ensure we are providing the best possible guidance and mitigation for our customers&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;and that “[t]he best protection is to apply updates as soon as possible across all impacted systems.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NFTs, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CUwmt6PC9yCHDThvasRp_NBDs7Q=/0x70:1252x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68904498/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.21.50_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/kitty/896775" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptokitties.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m3ofto"&gt;There’s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, “Um… what’s going on here?” That’s the feeling I’ve experienced while reading about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308075/grimes-nft-6-million-sales-nifty-gateway-warnymph"&gt;Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs&lt;/a&gt; or about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;Nyan Cat being sold as one&lt;/a&gt;. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet&lt;/a&gt; up for sale as an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4vZyml"&gt;You might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq4l9b"&gt;After literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I’m going to cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vM2Wj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s start with the basics. What is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XAkRR1"&gt;Non-fungible token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lwjaI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That doesn’t make it any clearer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBCh6D"&gt;Right, sorry. “Non-fungible” more or less means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which &lt;em&gt;StadiumTalk&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/most-expensive-baseball-cards-985687df1bbe45c5"&gt;calls “the Mona Lisa of baseball cards.&lt;/a&gt;” (I’ll take their word for it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HudKGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do NFTs work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbvoGM"&gt;At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (&lt;a href="https://dappradar.com/blog/tron-introduces-nft-standard-trc-721"&gt;Some already have&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifr4y9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbHk7K"&gt;NFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vAcH3qsbkwApyVu4-Zl-AJ1hXFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341197/doge.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x3b3ee1931dc30c1957379fac9aba94d1c48a5405/576" target="_blank"&gt;NyanCat on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin isn’t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go0IlP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mean, like, people buying my good tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4V58lf"&gt;I don’t think anyone can stop you, but that’s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/nfts-guide-nonfungible-tokens-cryptomedia-trend-ownership-internet/"&gt;an evolution of fine art collecting&lt;/a&gt;, only with digital art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cLI5c1"&gt;(Side note, when coming up with the line “buying my good tweets,” we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn’t be a real thing. So &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316320/jack-dorsey-original-tweet-nft-cent-valuables"&gt;the founder of Twitter would take a shot at it&lt;/a&gt; just days after we posted the article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaSIX4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do people really think this will become like art collecting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ig7cLB"&gt;I’m sure some people really hope so — like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;50-second video by Grimes&lt;/a&gt; or the person who paid $6.6 million for &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x12f28e2106ce8fd8464885b80ea865e98b465149/100010001"&gt;a video by Beeple&lt;/a&gt;. Actually, one of Beeple’s pieces &lt;a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/lots/2020"&gt;is being auctioned at Christie’s&lt;/a&gt;, the famou—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q3dcQxqw8oMubtaqyVI6ZzIM37o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341206/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.31.26_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoink!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i77Dld"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNNHsj"&gt;Wow, rude. But yeah, that’s where it &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-boom-collectors-shell-out-crypto/"&gt;gets a bit awkward&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that’s included with an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmQtyf"&gt;But NFTs are designed to give you something that can’t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWoqGE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No shade on Beeple, but the video isn’t really a Monet.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBUNfq"&gt;What do you think of &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/secondary/0x4140783cc1ba30653a0777126b122931e233ba14/1300010027"&gt;the $3,600 Gucci Ghost&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeTKAEvLmop3TJky4G1whbuRXB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341209/GucciGhost.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Trevor Andrew&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGn9Ci"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Also, if I got a Monet, I could appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WyUKa"&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;flex &lt;/em&gt;of owning an original Beeple...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juDtL1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the point?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d92bZ"&gt;That really depends on whether you’re an artist or a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dt7KYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m an artist.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ1eqE"&gt;First off: I’m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIsq2g"&gt;Also, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;the NFT is sold or changes hands&lt;/a&gt;, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you’ll see some of that benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7oBax"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m a buyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwjNxk"&gt;One of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that’s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVWIC6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No, I meant I’m a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;collector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYjdCo"&gt;Ah, okay, yes. NFTs can work &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-02/nft-art-boom-is-the-same-concept-as-the-photography-market?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;like any other speculative asset&lt;/a&gt;, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuKmlZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So every NFT is unique?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91YTgt"&gt;In the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there’s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there’s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09JRP3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQVHLe"&gt;Well, that’s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they’re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pokémon cards (where they’re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pokémon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1JJGI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please stop. I hate where this is going.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/laUmvyGGiD-HsDas7TBDZall_n4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341219/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.39.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Logan Paul&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv0A8X"&gt;Yeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, &lt;a href="https://shopnfts.net/"&gt;for up to $20,000&lt;/a&gt;. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pokémon card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gh63Tc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWkQs7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Calvinn_Hobbes/status/746227239755251712?s=20"&gt;A fool and their money are soon parted&lt;/a&gt;, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8ZNFb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXPBux"&gt;Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/linkin-park-mike-shinoda-happy-endings-nft-interview"&gt;actually talked about that&lt;/a&gt;. It’s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, “an opportunist crooked jerk.” I’m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="611ErY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I buy this article as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cw2A6d"&gt;No, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT. deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/william-shatners-nft-collectibles-sell-out-at-warp-speed"&gt;Shatner-themed trading cards&lt;/a&gt; (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DjDJOZf5-4jdVe9fHSNlrMuXD0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341226/Screen_Shot_2021_03_02_at_3.43.12_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0DpEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross. Actually, could I buy someone’s teeth as an NFT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2y73FL"&gt;There have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/12/10/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent/"&gt;verify sneakers’ authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks&lt;/a&gt;. But so far, I haven’t found any teeth, no. I’m scared to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRUxvr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look? Where? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbiIN"&gt;There are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes’ choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwUvnp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zszcnd"&gt;NFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them &lt;a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/"&gt;as part of a new standard&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, one of the first uses was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CryptoKitties"&gt;a game called CryptoKitties&lt;/a&gt; that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkghYZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love kittens&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMnW6"&gt;Not as much as &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/cryptokitties-bought-a-digital-cat-for-172000/"&gt;the person who paid over $170,000 for one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My face when I’m worth $170K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yFaF1c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrrrrggggg!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD0ynI"&gt;Same. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon’s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/26/the-deanbeat-how-non-fungible-tokens-nfts-will-change-games/"&gt;already games&lt;/a&gt; that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kk4a1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-wuFlpK8EGVxFIUYTKb0hFd3pBM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341161/robbery.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image is not an NFT. Yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBINrG"&gt;That depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49177705"&gt;cryptocurrencies have been stolen before&lt;/a&gt;, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAPTND"&gt;Note: Please don’t steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnhPUz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIQPdV"&gt;Probably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can’t be opened anymore, websites go down, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227535/nyt-bitcoin-millions-forgot-passwords-digital-wallet"&gt;people forget the password to their wallets&lt;/a&gt;. But physical art in museums is also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETAcIbzOTYs"&gt;shockingly fragile&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6zH8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QU56ST"&gt;Yes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZmGbU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOtuLt"&gt;It’s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as cryptocurrencies, they could also end up using a lot of electricity per transaction. There are people working &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;on mitigations for this issue&lt;/a&gt;, which is great because I don’t want to set the world on fire for CryptoKitties, much less Logan Paul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23nZ0d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I build an underground art cave / bunker to store my NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhQ69E"&gt;Well, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXB6fZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you tired of typing “NFT”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNFTvl"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM05sp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 5th, 8:07 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Please do not give billionaire Jack Dorsey money for his tweet</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YWCub9"&gt;Jack Dorsey, the billionaire co-founder and CEO of Twitter, a man who stans bitcoin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack"&gt;right on his Twitter bio&lt;/a&gt;, is attempting to sell his very first tweet as an NFT — a digital good that lives on the Ethereum blockchain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wadzT"&gt;You’re probably familiar with the famous tweet, “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/a&gt;”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oUWGxZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;just setting up my twttr&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 21, 2006&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxLim"&gt;Despite the fact that this tweet has been publicly available as a free digital item to look at whenever anybody wanted for nearly 15 years, Dorsey is now trying to sell it as an NFT, or “non-fungible token,” &lt;a href="https://v.cent.co/tweet/20"&gt;through a platform called Valuables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KpY5to"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/xCnWG9EqgD"&gt;https://t.co/xCnWG9EqgD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367990471759306752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FWFYMr"&gt;As you would rightly expect, bidding is already north of $80K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oexyzt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OvD7Qm"&gt;What does “buying” this tweet actually mean? “What you are purchasing is a digital certificate of the tweet, unique because it has been signed and verified by the creator,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBx-HXY8ow_7bElsJZ6Sk3r2V9cQjSRdWFyKCUXZtAs/edit"&gt;according to Valuables’ FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmMiQA"&gt;In other words, an autograph. You’re buying an autograph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rneaHm"&gt;The tweet will continue to live on the internet for as long as Dorsey, and Twitter the company, choose to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udueqU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXhDm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZCGgz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sc1aYi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover scoots around on Mars for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZA26xJgtS9y1ittuHz0RRJHILYw=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920555/pia24482_4_1041.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A trail of wheel tracks left by NASA’s Perseverance rover after making its first drive on the Martian surface | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4B9rn"&gt;Perseverance, the car-sized rover NASA landed on Mars last month, has taken its first spin on the rocky surface of Jezero Crater, NASA announced today. The rover’s six wheels drove about 21 feet to carry out a key mobility test on Thursday, as engineers back on Earth prepare to execute the mission’s core science objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO6c6R"&gt;The rover’s six aluminum wheels left tracks on the Martian dirt — as captured by one of its on-board cameras — after driving straight for 13 feet, then turning around to back up 8 feet. Anais Zarifian, Perseverance’s mobility testbed engineer, told reporters it went “incredibly well” and performed better than it did during pre-launch tests on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5J8XNFKf8nNp7aovCiHftWsDdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349165/Mar_05_2021_17_48_58.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An animation showing Perseverance’s first drive on Mars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eq2F0D"&gt;“I don’t think I’ve ever been happier to see wheel tracks — and I’ve seen a lot of them,” she says. “This is just a huge milestone for the mission and the mobility team. We’ve driven on Earth, but driving on Mars is really the ultimate goal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ76jn"&gt;Though short and slow, the drive demonstration gave engineers refreshing confidence that NASA’s $2.4 billion rover is ready to travel some 656 feet over the next two years to analyze rocks and scoop up coveted Martian soil samples for a future return mission. “This was just so amazing to see last night. We’re really happy about this,” says Robert Hogg, Perseverance deputy mission manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVkcL8"&gt;Like its sister rover Curiosity, Perseverance’s top speed is 0.1 miles per hour, “so not very fast,” Zarifian says. It uses a “bogie” suspension system that can climb over rocks as big as its own wheels, about 20 inches in diameter, while keeping its main body level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUzlcd"&gt;But landing a wheeled robot on Mars isn’t about speed. With an improved computer for avoiding obstacles and sand pits, “we’ll have less time planning drives and down time, and more time to do science,” Zarifian says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6pOVjIWDat5cVWefGtAI8sIWVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22349166/PIA24485_K4_ZCAM_main_sol004_Delta_Remnant_unannotated.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elevated slab of land that Scientists say is a junction where ancient rivers once flowed into Jezero, a dried up lake bed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tSyauE"&gt;Since landing on February 18th, Perseverance has beamed back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291412/nasa-perseverance-rover-first-images-landing-skycrane"&gt;thousands of images&lt;/a&gt; from most of its 19 on-board cameras, including a frame released Friday showing Jezero’s Delta, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25700/the-road-ahead-for-perseverance/"&gt;a target site&lt;/a&gt; for the rover to drive toward in the near future. Scientists say the elevated landform, seen surrounded by an obstacle course of rocks and sand pits, is a junction between an ancient dried-out river and the lake that Jezero used to be 3.5 billion years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F0hbR6"&gt;Mission teams at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California are mulling different paths for Perseverance’s trek to the delta, aiming to settle on one in the coming weeks that is “most efficient, safest, and most scientifically interesting,” says Katie Stack Morgan, the mission’s deputy project scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6LVgn"&gt;NASA released &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25674/perseverances-mastcam-z-first-high-resolution-panorama/"&gt;Perseverance’s first high-resolution panorama&lt;/a&gt; this week captured by the rover’s Mastcam-Z camera. The mosaic’s 79 images were taken on the Martian afternoon of February 22nd, and one YouTube user edited it into a 4K video that slowly pans across Jezero’s horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eoDVlJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z0PtX-1xre8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcVQjj"&gt;The rocks appearing in Perseverance’s new images “were likely deposited by rivers flowing into the ancient lake Jezero,” Morgan says, adding that scientists are working to understand the rock’s origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cweExj"&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21346844/nasa-mars-2020-rover-perseverance-launch-atlas-v-success-travel-time"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; from Florida last summer for a seven-month trek to the Red Planet, exploiting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266752/uae-china-nasa-mars-missions"&gt;a two-month window of time&lt;/a&gt; when Earth and Mars align closely in their orbits around the Sun once every two years. 293 million miles later, it survived a blazing fast, seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere last month and carried out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;extremely complex landing&lt;/a&gt; at Jezero Crater, a dried up lake bed that scientists hope could hold signs of microbial life fossilized from billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jBMdo"&gt;The rover’s mission team memorialized the rover’s landing site at Jezero by &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/25701/welcome-to-octavia-e-butler-landing/"&gt;naming it after Octavia E. Butler&lt;/a&gt;, the late science fiction author and the first Black woman to win a Hugo Award and Nebula Award.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The SEC is dragging AT&amp;T to court for illegally duping analysts into lowering expectations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/get-fnU1xDnsBORtAThkdh0L7Qc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920429/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mABC7X"&gt;The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is suing AT&amp;amp;T for providing nonpublic information to 20 different analyst firms so they would lower revenue estimates ahead of earnings, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-43?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. That let AT&amp;amp;T “beat” expectations for the quarter when the information-sharing took place, turning what could have been some nasty headlines in the financial press into a win instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7kq7R"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20500640-sec-complaint-against-att"&gt;SEC’s complaint (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T learned in March 2016 that its quarterly results would fall short of estimates due in part to “a steeper-than-expected decline in smartphone sales.” As you might recall, we used to live in a world where carriers like AT&amp;amp;T subsidized part of the cost of your smartphone, but by then AT&amp;amp;T had passed that cost along to the customer — which meant far fewer customers were upgrading them every year or two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NHVe1"&gt;This quarter was going to be AT&amp;amp;T’s worst-ever for smartphone upgrades: a record low of just 5 percent, according to the complaint. As a result, AT&amp;amp;T expected that its consolidated gross revenue “was expected to fall more than $1 billion below the consensus estimate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLmm7w"&gt;Here is what happened next, from the complaint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eCN37P"&gt;Fearful of a revenue miss at the end of the quarter, AT&amp;amp;T’s Chief Financial Officer instructed AT&amp;amp;T’s IR Department to “work the analysts who still have equipment revenue too high.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VBQK5"&gt;In turn, the Director of Investor Relations (“IR Director”) instructed Womack, Evans, and Black to speak to analysts privately on a one-by-one basis about their estimates in order to “walk the analysts down”—i.e., induce analysts to reduce their individual estimates. The goal was to induce enough analysts to lower their estimates so that the consensus revenue estimate would fall to the level that AT&amp;amp;T expected to report to the public—i.e., AT&amp;amp;T would not have a revenue miss, which would have been the company’s third consecutive quarterly miss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TQtoRe"&gt;In their calls, the three IR executives “intentionally disclosed material nonpublic information regarding AT&amp;amp;T’s results to date,” the SEC alleges. Of the 20 analyst firms listed in the complaint, all of them lowered their revenue estimates — and many took AT&amp;amp;T’s 5 percent number directly. The SEC suggests that AT&amp;amp;T’s executives hid the fact that these numbers weren’t the kind that are supposed to be shared, so analysts may not have known that they shouldn’t have had access to that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1t1w8"&gt;Executives emailed amongst themselves the day before its Q1 2016 earnings in relief, the complaint shows. The company’s CFO even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179"&gt;apparently told&lt;/a&gt; the CEO that two analyst updates “may do it for us,” with the CEO replying, “Good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kG4VX5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is AT&amp;amp;T anxiously pushing analysts to lower estimates so that a single quarter of earnings doesn't create bad headlines, even though the results stink. And it goes all the way to the top, per the SEC. &lt;br&gt;Just another reminder of what CEOs actually care about in private. &lt;a href="https://t.co/qxbMNvVsYQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qxbMNvVsYQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dave Benoit (@DaveCBenoit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveCBenoit/status/1367955623321735179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPHf9Z"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T ended up reporting $40.535 billion in revenue for Q1 2016, barely beating the revised consensus analyst estimates by less than $100 million, according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLASME"&gt;The company disputed the SEC’s allegations &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/att-disputes-sec-allegations-301241737.html"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that “there was no disclosure of material nonpublic information”.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMB2Sf"&gt;“The information discussed during these March and April 2016 conversations concerned the widely reported, industry-wide phase-out of subsidy programs for new smartphone purchases and the impact of this trend on smartphone upgrade rates and equipment revenue,” the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtEuMa"&gt;“Not only did AT&amp;amp;T publicly disclose this trend on multiple occasions before the analyst calls in question, but AT&amp;amp;T also made clear that the declining phone sales had no material impact on its earnings,” it continued. “Analysts and the news media frequently wrote about this trend and investors understood that AT&amp;amp;T’s core business was selling connectivity (i.e., wireless service plans), not devices, and that smartphone sales were immaterial to the company’s earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to run a battery life report on your Windows laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XFhRLRTU_TPv314udxi31dIGur4=/0x0:1401x934/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68920093/2021_03_05_12_57_46_Window.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eLEqZP"&gt;When my editor told me about Window’s built-in battery report, my first thought was: “How have I never heard of this before? Also, that sounds pretty useful!” So I looked at the guide he sent (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/generate-battery-report-windows-10"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Laptop Magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and tried it out. It ended up being just as interesting as it sounded, so I figured I’d share, in case you also haven't come across this handy built-in tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vVa2I"&gt;Windows has been keeping track of how your laptop’s battery is doing since it was installed. The report, which you can run using just two command prompt commands, will show how many cycles you’ve used on your battery and how it’s been used in the past three days. It will also give you a picture of what Windows estimates your battery life &lt;em&gt;should &lt;/em&gt;be versus what it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBdzup"&gt;So if you’re curious about your battery status or you’ve been noticing that your battery life has been a bit of a drag lately and are wondering if it’s due to neglect or some power virus on your computer sucking back a bunch of juice, this report should let you know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BS1W6n"&gt;First, open the Command Prompt tool. To do that, you can search “CMD” from the Start menu, and click on Command Prompt to open it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hOBzv4"&gt;The report will be spit out as an HTML file, so we’ll want to make sure it’s easy to find. To do that, type in:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="U84nf8"&gt;cd %HOMEPATH%/Desktop&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nSCkQd"&gt;This command simply navigates your current directory to your desktop, so when you generate the report, you can find it there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C5yFIG"&gt;To generate the report, type:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0iuN04"&gt;powercfg /batteryreport&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7eeRF7"&gt;This runs the powerconfig tool and tells it to spit out a battery report, which should now be sitting on your desktop as an HTML file. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0l81HX"&gt;Double-click the file to open it up in your browser (or it might ask you which program you want to open the file in, which would be your browser). Now you can see all of that sweet, sweet battery information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2harnZA_gc4oHos7EWjqSZNBLKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348843/2021_03_05_12_58_45_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery usage graph can tell you how fast your battery drains over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idS43L5kQsUnn7xGLTXvw0Zk0Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348842/2021_03_05_12_58_28_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This could help you get an idea of how you use your battery or show your recent computer habits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aou0giOVBFxfinE0FN9vmQdXI-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348845/2021_03_05_12_59_16_Window.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing the design capacity estimate versus your actual time could tell you whether it’s time to replace your battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9ES6Yz"&gt;One caveat: my laptop is used, and as a policy, I completely nuke whatever Windows install is on any laptop I buy, overwriting it with a new one. If you’ve just bought a used laptop and want to know what state the battery is in, you’ll probably want to run this tool &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; wiping Windows, as it seems the cycle count only reflects what’s happened on the current Windows install. My laptop is a 2018 model, and I’m pretty sure it’s gone through more than 177 cycles since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="guYuTT"&gt;Even if you’re on a newer install, you can get a general sense of the health by looking at the design capacity and then the full charge capacity to see how different they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HUR5NY"&gt;If you’re an Apple user who’s feeling left out, don’t worry: macOS lets you access some battery information, too, though there isn’t as much historical data. To see it, go to the Apple menu in the top left, and click “About This Mac.” Then click the System Report button, and under Hardware, go to Power. There, you can see the cycle count of your battery, its estimated health, and all of your current power settings. To see your battery usage graphs over the past 24 hours or 10 days, go to System Preferences and then Battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33ojstncKFLw3Ojat3wySNP4FIE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_1.15.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has fewer graphs built in, but you can see usage statistics in System Preferences &amp;gt; Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Here’s a first look at Mark Cuban’s podcasting platform Fireside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UDIvZoCfuPgKGutmVw_HbHDley4=/1x0:2578x1718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919947/fireside.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zHd2Py"&gt;Last month, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;broke news&lt;/a&gt; of Mark Cuban and Falon Fatemi’s new app Fireside, which promises to deliver a “next-gen podcast platform,” and today, we can provide a better sense of the app’s functionality and interface. It’s currently in beta on iOS with a limited number of testers, most of whom appear to work in venture capital or as podcasters. However, their chats are visible to anyone, even non-users, through a browser, and from this desktop view, as well as screenshots of the app that &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has viewed, we can get a sense of what Fireside is trying to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMx8P5"&gt;Broadly, the app is best described as a hybrid between Spotify’s Anchor software and Clubhouse. Although it prioritizes live conversation, like Clubhouse, it tries to make off-the-cuff conversations sound more professional. Intro music welcomes people into a room, for example, which is a nice touch, but it doesn’t exactly translate like it does during an edited podcast. The music, for now, sounds disjointed and out of place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPWRxG"&gt;The broad emphasis, at least based on the conversations happening in the app, appears to be on how Fireside can help podcasters monetize their work through exclusive conversations or, in some cases, recruit them to Fireside for all of their podcasting efforts. The app encourages audience participation more than Clubhouse, in that users can react to conversations without being onstage, and they can type comments or questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHo7v3"&gt;Creators on the app say they’ve heard that the app will allow them to host their shows and distribute them through RSS feeds to Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and other podcast players, too, which is more aligned with Anchor than Clubhouse. One creator in a chat says they plan to use Fireside for hosting instead of their usual service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIvA07"&gt;Looking at the desktop view, users’ profiles include a photo, bio, and follower / following count. You can also view the rooms that user has hosted, as well as the ones they’ve participated in. The app natively records conversations, so you can listen to these past chats from the desktop. The app seemingly assigns an emoji to the archived chats, although it’s unclear how they’re chosen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YobM-cWRBeUv2ZuoQf-b71ZztKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348776/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_3.38.16_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WtUmPs"&gt;After you tap into a chat, you can press play on a conversation. You’ll likely immediately notice hold-like music at the start, which comes from a Fireside bot called waitBOT. The bot says it plays “soothing music for you while you wait for people to join.” You can also see the description of the event as a chyron along the bottom of the screen, as well as info, like how many people listened in and who hosted it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jln9EA"&gt;A “jump” button allows you to skip to highlighted parts of the conversation, which the host chooses. As speakers change throughout the conversation, you’ll see their profile picture and name. Speakers with a gavel are moderators, while speakers with a crown are the hosts. Moderators and hosts can automatically mute people and welcome people to the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jbLNEiVvAU-mJSLfjbbxlmNydek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348791/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_3.42.29_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gr-gK0I8ihXDXsbzhaRWbyQaF4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348800/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_3.50.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The gavel icon represents a moderator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8o8pb"&gt;Tuning into a live chat from the desktop is a little less thorough than the recorded conversations. You can only view icons and names, as well as the number of people listening. When someone’s microphone is on, their photo is fully opaque, and when they’re muted, it’s transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrFZtP"&gt;From the app itself, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has seen in screenshots, users can “react” to conversations with emoji and sound effects. People can clap, for example, which shows up in the recorded conversations and solves for a problem Clubhouse users have run into: a silent room and no way to gauge how what they’re saying is going over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vzmDO"&gt;Audience members can also choose an emoji and type a comment without jumping into a conversation directly. These comments and emoji will show up over participants’ heads as a thought bubble. Moderators or hosts can then type back or address comments during the chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UAwVhJ"&gt;If participants &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; want to join the live chat, they can request to join the stage by tapping a microphone emoji and submitting a written request. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-H3KgTuLRHNRchoDblyVQ9QcdCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22348818/Screen_Shot_2021_03_05_at_3.40.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A view of a live Fireside chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThAsYI"&gt;For now, this is our best view of Fireside. Fatemi declined to comment for this story, and we don’t have a better sense of when the app might launch publicly. We’ll update this story if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford recalls some of the first Mustang Mach-E SUVs due to loose bolts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NRor00JSPYm9pzwFHakIUrzg_s4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919682/sokane_210125_4386_1753.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5s3l7t"&gt;Ford is &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/03/05/ford-motor-company-to-address-subframe-bolt-issue.html"&gt;recalling&lt;/a&gt; dozens of the first Mustang Mach-E deliveries after it discovered loose bolts during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;the quality checks that are holding up shipments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5FRj4"&gt;“[S]ome vehicles may have subframe bolts that the supplier did not tighten to specification,” Ford wrote Friday afternoon. “While the issue in affected vehicles is not to Ford’s standards, the company is not aware of any accidents or injuries related to this condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1htERf"&gt;Ford says 1,258 Mustang Mach-Es are affected in the US, as well as 90 in Canada, but that the overwhelming majority of those have not been shipped to customers yet. “Fewer than 75 customers who have already taken delivery” will have to bring their Mustang Mach-E in to get fixed, according to the company. Ford says it will start contacting these owners beginning on March 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhhgQx"&gt;The recall is minuscule by most standards, and so far it doesn’t seem to be nearly as serious as, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299121/hyundai-kona-electric-recall-battery-fire-lg"&gt;Hyundai Kona EVs catching fire&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s another small hiccup in the rollout of Ford’s first mass-market EV. The company has delivered around 4,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs so far, but this week delayed the release of some 4,500 in order to do extra quality checks and is compensating some owners as a result. It’s unclear if those checks were spurred by the bolt issue or some other suspicion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube has terminated five Myanmar military-run channels as political unrest continues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protesters hold wet pieces of cloth and plastic bags of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfjrDsxLJaUwwi4xmAiPNRN112A=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919241/1231535547.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aung Kyaw Htet / SOPA Images / LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="70Efte"&gt;YouTube terminated five Myanmar military channels from its platform on Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-youtube/youtube-removes-five-myanmar-tv-channels-from-platform-idUSKBN2AX0BQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The removals include YouTube channels for the government-run Myanma Radio and Television (MRTV) network and the military-owned Myawaddy Media used to spread military propaganda in Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kkn82D"&gt;YouTube’s action is the platform’s first major intervention following &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22260076/myanmar-coup-military-suu-kyi-explain"&gt;the military coup that was staged in February&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent military crackdowns against protesters that have left &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/myanmar-military-coup-deaths/2021/03/03/076de674-7c85-11eb-8c5e-32e47b42b51b_story.html"&gt;at least 38 dead&lt;/a&gt;. “We have terminated a number of channels and removed several videos from YouTube in accordance with our community guidelines and applicable laws,” a YouTube spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Prior to the coup, the company also terminated 34 channels used as “influence operations” during Myanmar’s election in 2020, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY0XDC"&gt;Facebook has also attempted to limit the military’s influence, banning all military pages on its platforms in February and cutting off the organization’s access to ads on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/24/technology/facebook-myanmar-ban.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;the military banned Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and has drastically limited access to all social networks by enacting regular internet curfews across the country since the coup began, &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-myanmar-amid-apparent-military-uprising-JBZrmlB6"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NetBlocks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook’s more active response to the military’s actions could be seen as a direct result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18068104/facebook-business-social-responsibility-myanmar-report"&gt;the criticism the social network received&lt;/a&gt; for its role in the genocidal violence that occurred in Myanmar in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ohn6d5"&gt;YouTube’s bans surely haven’t addressed all pro-military propaganda on the platform, but they show a willingness to intervene as protests against the military junta continue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Silicon Valley school is using virtual escape rooms to evaluate prospective students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Six small dolls stand in a circle around a globe." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emXxfp2ukbnKiasU3kFFdK5fNAs=/743x180:1921x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68919154/TAPISW__00.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo on the escape room’s opening screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Paruzal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7mo6f6"&gt;Applying to an elite middle school sounds like a stressful experience, and I’m sure COVID-19 doesn’t help. With things like open houses, campus tours, and in-person interviews off the table, applicants have fewer chances to experience their prospective schools — and admissions offices have fewer chances to meet their prospective students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZaB7p"&gt;One San Jose private school has come up with a unique solution: The Harker School, &lt;a href="https://www.harker.org/about"&gt;self-described&lt;/a&gt; as “one of the nation’s top college prep schools,” is putting teams of sixth grade applicants through a virtual escape room. Over a Zoom call, the 11-year-olds work together to solve a series of Harker-themed puzzles, and admissions officers observe their behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW0GU4"&gt;Harker let me go through the game myself, alongside a friend of mine who’s an experienced escape room artist. I imagine that, to an 11-year-old, the process may have been stressful and somewhat dystopian. But for me, a grown-up, it was a heck of a lot of fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPMJmy"&gt;The game came from a collaboration between Harker and &lt;a href="https://paruzal.com/"&gt;Paruzal&lt;/a&gt;, a Denver-based company that specializes in live-hosted online escape rooms. &lt;a href="https://paruzal.com/episodes"&gt;Paruzal’s games&lt;/a&gt; take place in all kinds of settings, from Bruce Springsteen concerts to coffee shops and pizzerias, with high stakes, including “Can you find the backup coffee beans before the food critic arrives?” “Will you be able to build the bobblehead to unlock your office door on time?” and “Will you get to meet Bruce Springsteen in his dressing room before the journalist arrives and interrupts you?” They’re low-tech operations, though: a Zoom call, a series of PowerPoint-esque slides, and a game master who leads the charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmL8V"&gt;Harker isn’t the first institution to turn to pared-down online puzzles as an educational tool. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;Escape rooms built from Google Forms&lt;/a&gt; have been popular among teachers and librarians since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the sort of exercise ready-made for assessing teamwork and problem-solving skills, as well as engaging kids who are stuck at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leKWsQ"&gt;The sixth grade game, called “The Annual Picnic,” was designed to evaluate how a student thinks on their feet. “There’s really no good way to practice playing a game,” says James Warner, Paruzal’s owner. “You’re really showing more of your true self.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A handwritten note on a piece of lined paper reads: “Dear Sixth Graders, You must be wondering where all your stuff is. We didn’t want anyone else taking it, so we hid it. But we forgot the lock combinations, sorry. Everything’s in the lockers, and we’re sure you’ll have no problem solving the puzzles. Good luck!” At the bottom are four signatures." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6CEqRSX9yaKXPBYeR2THtfvPJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346223/TAPISW_09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Sports commentator voice* It begins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ymKoct"&gt;The scenario was as follows: we were put in the shoes of Harker School sixth graders setting up a booth for the school’s annual picnic. (This is a real event Harker puts on every year. As described, it sounds like a massive operation that my public middle school could not have pulled off in its wildest dreams.) The supplies necessary to construct this booth were locked in some lockers, however, and the combinations were hidden in various parts of Harker’s library. To “escape” from the library, we had to find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiKj45"&gt;My teammate and I began our search. We were shown crudely drawn locations like a desk, a fridge, and a bookcase. We quibbled between ourselves over which location to investigate, then informed the game master of our decision. He swapped to the appropriate slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXvhQz"&gt;In this manner, we embarked on our quest across the library, finding the combinations we sought in chocolate chip cookies, sausages, old recipes, cryptic posters, and other various items. One puzzle involved some arithmetic on the number of pages in a stack of books. A jar contained cookies with varying numbers of chips, which led us to another combination. Some of the puzzles were busywork; a picture of a bunch of owls that hung on the wall ended up being a Morse Code message that we had to grind out. Others were legitimately tricky; we spent several minutes agonizing over what to do with a bag of sausages before realizing we should tell the game master to open the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGF1r"&gt;My teammate and I finished Harker’s escape room in just under 30 minutes. Teams of applicants average around 33 minutes — so we did beat the average 11-year-old, although not by a lot. (In our defense, my ego wouldn’t allow me to ask for too many hints. They’re technically unlimited in Harker’s game. Game masters also have strategies for speeding the kids along. “We have some say in how long the game is based on how forcefully I recommend that they ask for a hint,” says Warner.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Ic891"&gt;Based on our score, Warner believes my teammate and I would be strong candidates for Harker’s sixth grade class. (He noted that while I seemed like more of a leader, my teammate had more useful ideas. Fair enough!) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A list of 16 books with the surnames of their authors printed on parchment. Books include: Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury; And Then There Were None, Christie; A Tale of Two Cities, Dickens; The Three Musketeers, Dumas; One Hundred Years of Solitude, Garcia Marquez; Seven Years in Tibet, Harrer; The House of the Seven Gables, Hawthorne; Catch-22, Heller; One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Kesey; The No. 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, McCall Smith; 1984, Orwell." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NtANpKDIFFkpeaOtpeYNQRRpZO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346225/TAPISW_23.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We had to add and subtract some of the numbers in these titles to get one of the combinations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FDjZtZ"&gt;Of course, the score isn’t the only factor. Were we Harker applicants, admissions officers would have been watching our interactions closely. “You take notes on the various performances to identify a student that screams at one of their counterparts in the game, or maybe there’s somebody who’s building consensus,” Warner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAbwqW"&gt;There are also some Easter eggs built into the game that can help differentiate students with sophisticated knowledge. One of the locker combinations was “24601” — “Ah, &lt;em&gt;Les Mis&lt;/em&gt;,” I remarked upon discovery. That’s apparently something Harker is watching for. “It’s a way to help the staff ... get a feel for how broad an applicant’s experience is,” Warner says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Four pictures on a gray background: a stack of four small lockers, an Indian flag, a padlock, and a plate of Indian food including bread, rice, and sauces. Arrows point from the lockers to the padlock, and from the padlock to the food." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KtNcTPn2iopFT3_9XSemZyjO0Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347850/TAPISW_20.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paruzal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We saw this screen when we opened our first locker. It contained Indian food, which we’d be serving at our picnic booth. Typing this is making me hungry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TkSVB"&gt;The escape room I completed has been retired — the next batch of applicants will get a different one — but Paruzal plans to keep the game on the backburner as a tool, even as in-person interviewing eventually resumes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3i3SD"&gt;In some ways, Harker’s game replicates aspects of the pre-pandemic admissions process — the campus tour, the open house. “Before the pandemic, I know some [secondary schools] would observe students in a group setting when they were doing a visit to see how they reacted,” says admissions expert Eric Nichols, VP for Enrollment Management at Loyola University Maryland. “That’s why they’re doing the virtual escape room: the chance to observe students to see how they react to a situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skYMFK"&gt;But some of the quirks we displayed during our game strike me as traits that would be difficult to draw out through even the traditional pre-pandemic process. I’ll admit that when I conceive of a Silicon Valley private school seeking diplomatic sixth graders with knowledge of 19th century French literature, I’m tempted to roll my eyes. But within an application file of grades, standardized test scores, and other sorts of metrics that can be gamed with camps and tutors, perhaps escape room acumen could help exceptional students without exceptional numbers stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkj9I1"&gt;“Nothing’s going to replace grades, but for students who are on the borderline academically, those softer skills can help an admission office decide who they might want to take a chance on,” Nichols says. “It puts everyone on an equal playing field.”&lt;/p&gt;
