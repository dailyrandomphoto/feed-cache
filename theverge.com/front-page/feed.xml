    <title>First trailer for Disney’s live-action Cruella movie feels more Joker than 101 Dalmatians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM5qY275OBC-aIHh_O1SOWK0NiM=/97x0:1207x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68830012/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.59.58_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7tWpw"&gt;There’s a moment in the first trailer for Disney’s live-action &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;movie when Emma Stone utters in a terrible faux British accent, “I am woman, hear me roar.” It feels less like something Disney fans will remember from the iconic &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians &lt;/em&gt;villain, Cruella de Vil, and more like Jared Leto’s Joker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22278944/zack-snyder-justice-league-official-premiere-trailer-hbo-max"&gt;telling Batman, “We live in a society.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0MSzZ"&gt;All of which is to say that Disney may have found its own Joker-type character in Stone’s Cruella de Vil... but not necessarily in a good way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xNrujM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;is set in 1970s London. Stone plays the soon-to-be-villain in an origin story of sorts. She’s an aspiring punk designer — and a grifter — who is trying to get society’s wealthiest people to take notice of her and her designs. Throughout the process, she becomes the infamous Cruella de Vil. (If that story sounds somewhat familiar, it may be because it’s seemingly very similar to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/loudmouthjulia/status/1362035570843803654"&gt;Jenny Humphrey’s arc in &lt;em&gt;Gossip Girl&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt;.) The way Stone is playing the villain also has hints of Joker and Harley Quinn, leaning into the “madness” of the character and upping the dramatics of it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagF2R"&gt;Now, of course, this is just a trailer, and we’re all aware that movies aren’t always best represented by their trailers. &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;could turn out to be an amazing film; we’ll just have to wait and see. Disney’s track record with live-action films is relatively hit or miss, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/11/20690427/lion-king-2019-remake-review-disney-beyonce-donald-glover-james-earl-jones-jon-favreau"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lion King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637207/aladdin-film-review-disney-live-action-remake-will-smith-guy-ritchie-mena-massoud-naomi-scott"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aladdin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast &lt;/em&gt;soared to more than $1 billion at the box office, but &lt;em&gt;Dumbo &lt;/em&gt;lost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167323/disney-live-action-adaptations-plus-streaming-pinocchio-peter-pan-wendy"&gt;Disney a sizable chunk of change&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;premiered to lackluster reviews. While &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;is inspired by &lt;em&gt;101 Dalmatians, &lt;/em&gt;it’s not a direct adaptation. Disney tried the same formula with &lt;em&gt;Maleficent&lt;/em&gt;: while the first film performed well, the follow-up, &lt;em&gt;Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, &lt;/em&gt;underperformed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLOSQO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; is set to be released on May 28th. Currently, it’s due out in theaters, but as Disney CEO Bob Chapek noted on the company’s recent earnings call, things could change with its theatrical slate depending on where the world is at with the current pandemic. That means there’s a chance &lt;em&gt;Cruella &lt;/em&gt;could wind up on Disney Plus either instead of in theaters or alongside a theatrical release. If that does happen, expect more information in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ecobee adds baby monitoring features to its SmartCamera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Ecobee SmartCamera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4qq51bHv7-R8H0K-ll6f5tqO9Y=/360x0:2520x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829934/ecobee_SmartCamera_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ecobee SmartCamera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ecobee&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YzE2tQ"&gt;Ecobee has updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221291/ecobee-smartcamera-haven-security-platorm-smart-home-price-specs-features"&gt;SmartCamera home security camera&lt;/a&gt; with a few new features that make it easier to use as a baby monitor. The new Baby Monitor mode, which is enabled during setup of the camera, adjusts the camera’s settings to dim the LED lights on the front, makes it harder to accidentally enable the camera’s Siren alarm, and, perhaps most importantly, adds an audio-only streaming option that lets you continue to listen for disruptions even if you switch to a different app or lock your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHzDF9"&gt;Using a home security camera as a baby monitor is hardly a new idea, but this is the first one to my knowledge that actually makes it easier to do so. While traditional video monitors provide an always-on feed to a dedicated screen, home security cameras require the use of your phone and an app, which can be slow to load and cumbersome to use. Ecobee’s audio streaming mode effectively turns the camera and your phone into an always-on audio monitor, from which you can then tap into the app to check the video feed when you hear a disturbance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbBJc4"&gt;The SmartCamera is also compatible with Apple’s HomeKit platform (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/2/22149216/ecobee-smart-camera-apple-homekit-support-firmware-update-subscription"&gt;including HomeKit Secure Video&lt;/a&gt;) and Amazon Alexa, which allows you to view the video feed from an Echo smart display or the Home app on an iOS or macOS device. Ecobee’s dedicated app is the only way to access the audio monitoring and other dedicated features such as pan and zoom on the SmartCamera, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3aOOMt4j-FfXeH4dtwVlPsdfBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309580/ecobee_SmartCameraVC_Lullaby_Day.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ecobee&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The baby monitoring features for the SmartCamera include dimmed LED lights and an audio streaming mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9arFDH"&gt;One thing the new baby monitor features don’t specifically address is the security concerns inherent with aiming an internet-connected camera at your baby’s crib. There have been numerous accounts of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21028092/amazon-ring-camera-hack-password-security-privacy-access-2fa"&gt;security cameras being accessed by an unauthorized user&lt;/a&gt; and children’s privacy being violated through the camera, speaker, and microphone. Ecobee does have two-factor authentication for its accounts, which helps prevent these kinds of attacks, but that might not be enough comfort for some parents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXAWPm"&gt;Ecobee notes that you can switch between the baby monitoring (which disables some of the home security features of the camera) and the standard security camera modes at any time, so once you no longer have the need for a baby monitor, you can repurpose the camera elsewhere in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1d2lkx"&gt;In addition to the new baby monitoring features, Ecobee is also now selling a &lt;a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/solutions-exclusives/sweet-dreams-baby-solution/"&gt;bundle that includes a SmartCamera and a SmartThermostat for $299.99&lt;/a&gt;. The SmartCamera is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ecobee-SmartCamera-Control-Built-Security/dp/B087D6DRCC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available separately for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch today’s Nintendo Direct live stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2ydYP5OaY5a9cDH0Cz8VU5XJGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829852/acastro_190530_1777_nintendo_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8UMJyH"&gt;If you’re into gaming, you’ll want to know that Nintendo is hosting a 50-minute live stream today that it calls Nintendo Direct, and the company will focus on games coming to the Switch in 2021. This is the first time the company has hosted a full-fledged Nintendo Direct live stream &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20850031/nintendo-direct-switch-seven-biggest-announcements-news-super-smash-snes-overwatch"&gt;since September 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZlig5"&gt;Nintendo already confirmed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1361676737730519042"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that it would be announcing information on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,&lt;/em&gt; but it did not offer any hints, though there’s a good chance we’ll be hearing about a new character for &lt;a href="https://smashbros.nintendo.com/buy/dlc/"&gt;the game’s second Fighter Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, the live stream will focus on games coming to Nintendo Switch “in the first half of 2021,” leaving fans to speculate what could be shown during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J15ClL"&gt;When does the Nintendo Direct start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHGpB"&gt;The live stream starts today, February 17th, at 2PM PT / 5PM ET / 10PM GMT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aFoXcC"&gt;Where can I watch the Nintendo Direct?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CBFWFs"&gt;We have embedded the live stream at the top of this post, so you can stay here to watch it when it begins. Otherwise, today’s Nintendo Direct will be available on &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/nintendo-direct/02-17-2021/"&gt;Nintendo’s official website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQ-dE_5el5Q"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVDkl"&gt;Of course, if you miss the stream, you can find coverage of all the Nintendo news here on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No Man’s Sky update lets you adopt wild animals as pets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xvqh7WvfBD7HjKNfGjeSDyfyUzw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829784/No_Man_s_Sky_Companions_Screenshot_5.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zSbe9A"&gt;Hello Games is adding companion animals to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450755/no-mans-sky-origin-expansion-hello-games-sean-murray-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Today, the developer announced a new update that allows players to tame wild creatures, bond with them, and even breed them. “They will travel side-by-side with you as you adventure through the universe both as a friend and as a valuable aide on your voyage,” Hello Games said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W62TJU"&gt;Once tamed, you can feed, play with, and explore with your companions; a “neural harness” transmits their thoughts directly to the player’s communication channels. “Creature personalities are defined by their species and ecosystem, such that no two creatures are alike, and their personalities develop further as you deepen your bond with them,” the developer said. It’s also worth noting that running into other Travellers may set your companion off, making it act frightened or aggressive, if not playful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cK68Vg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2wNFByBo3s?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TiWvzU"&gt;Once trained, companions can perform a variety of tasks for their Traveller, from scanning for resources and digging up treasure to hunting fauna and identifying hazards. Players who take good care of their companions may find collectible eggs they can choose to hatch or trade to other players. The update launches today and will also include “significant improvements” for load and warp times on PlayStation 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2EXhQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt; is celebrating its fifth anniversary this year, with the companions update kicking off Hello Games’ celebration plans. Since the game’s launch in 2016, the developer has continued to build the game through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21450919/hello-games-no-mans-sky-next-game-sean-murray-interview"&gt;massive content updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Shorts beta will launch in the United States in March </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9R6RIx-FXSd3HiCpZRUxJZNoiAg=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829754/shorts_youtube.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L7CncZ"&gt;YouTube is gearing up to launch a beta version of its TikTok competitor, Shorts, in the United States beginning in March, chief product officer Neal Mohan announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k379Nl"&gt;In a blog post announcing a number of features coming to YouTube in the coming months, Mohan said the YouTube team will be giving more creators access to Shorts in the United States. The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India, where the feature has existed for several months, according to Mohan. Since December, “the number of Indian channels using Shorts creation tools has more than tripled, and the YouTube Shorts player is now receiving more than 3.5 billion daily views globally,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oLEDA"&gt;Reports that YouTube was working on a TikTok competitor first emerged in April 2020, but YouTube didn’t roll out Shorts in India &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436158/youtube-starts-tiktok-competitor-short-form-video-instagram-reels-beta-test"&gt;until September&lt;/a&gt;. While the company was trying to figure out how to extend its creator base and 2 billion monthly users to a mobile-first product in wake of TikTok’s explosive popularity, Instagram was doing the same thing. Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;launched Reels not long&lt;/a&gt; before YouTube rolled out Shorts, leading two of the world’s biggest tech and social platforms racing to catch up to ByteDance’s app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PlrmjW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The YouTube team has seen success with Shorts in India&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMjKEk"&gt;It’s no surprise that YouTube is trying to get Shorts into the hands of creators and users as quickly as possible. By November 2020, TikTok was seeing continuous spikes in growth, tripling the user base it had in 2018. Like other companies, TikTok’s business was helped by the pandemic, giving people stuck at home the ability to engage with a never-ending stream of new, short videos and make their own. TikTok is forecasted to cross the 1 billion monthly active user line &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/new-forecast-pegs-tiktok-to-top-1-2b-monthly-active-users-in-2021/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHsY_7JfSNeqIDSlT2zjt_7imPDGSz5SVvIOvju6TxFRswkjZQGUQURJ7v9Ouiy89l7eG-p4ZMN_0G_m5ydXDQCp4ibK8Y2kTqAvnyPGi1BWAG4CVRjnYV96zC8Ypsr5VPMEYzi1nN9XMMOUns7dd4HkG80cP5gvhQwV8s9i42jO"&gt;this year, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro1eL5"&gt;All of this helps to explain why YouTube is finding new ways to give creators features that will keep them making videos for the platform (instead of pivoting entirely to TikTok or Reels). Mohan’s blog also announced new monetization features, including applause, which will allow &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9632365"&gt;fans to buy a one-time clapping animation&lt;/a&gt; that appears on top of the video. Creators are given a certain percentage of the revenue from each applause purchased. Similar tools like this already exist, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14249630/youtube-super-chat-pay-pin-comments-live-stream"&gt;including Super Chat&lt;/a&gt;. Mohan didn’t say when the feature will become available to creators, only that people should be able to “unlock” it later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcihDU"&gt;On top of that, YouTube is beta testing a “new integrated shopping experience” that will roll out later this year. The idea is that people can purchase items from channels whose opinions they trust. Creators can tag products in their videos allowing viewers to purchase them if they’d like, according to a YouTube spokesperson. As long as the product is within YouTube’s catalog, creators can tag them and viewers can purchase those products. Currently, those products are limited to beauty and electronic categories. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has asked YouTube for more information about the breakdown of revenue for creators if a product is bought from their channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dYHX9i"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6_t26Q9aVM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIcKKJ"&gt;In an effort to give people more control over parts of YouTube and how they watch videos, the company is rolling out a couple of product features that will directly impact what and how they watch. On the YouTube Kids app, the product team will offer new parental tools that will allow parents to add specific videos and channels from the main app, according to the blog. This will allow children to watch videos that parents think are acceptable but may not appear in the YouTube Kids app because of restrictions in place — think certain types of gaming videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntpLGh"&gt;Finally, YouTube’s team is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238551/youtube-chapters-experiment-music-game-soundtracks-timestamp-video"&gt;expanding its “chapters” feature&lt;/a&gt;, which adds specific timestamps to videos. They’ll soon be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21518034/google-search-ai-machine-learning-spelling-video-chapters-better-results"&gt;automatically added&lt;/a&gt; to relevant videos that may require chapters (like lo-fi chillhop channels). More detailed information about all of the changes can be read in Mohan’s blog, alongside the videos that YouTube’s product team will release throughout the year detailing what’s to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYK8Q3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is adding offline downloads and 4K streaming</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUF6Z24ux9IWeD5uXSDuh8SuNT4=/216x0:2490x1516/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829749/Screen_Shot_2021_02_17_at_8.23.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T7n1Je"&gt;If the monthly price for all of these streaming TV services is going to keep going up, the least they can do is throw in some new features and better video quality, right? That’s what YouTube says you can soon expect from YouTube TV; today, &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/neal-innovation-series/"&gt;the company announced&lt;/a&gt; that in the coming weeks, the service will “introduce a new add-on package with 4K streaming, offline viewing, and unlimited concurrent streams at home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntVz5p"&gt;Unfortunately, a YouTube TV spokesperson didn’t have much else to share beyond the top-level news of these upcoming additions. It’s not clear whether there will be any limits on what channels or shows support offline downloads, nor is YouTube giving any examples of what content will be available in 4K. One would hope for some sporting events. Currently, customers have a maximum of three concurrent streams, but it seems like YouTube will be removing any such constraints so long as you’re viewing from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU1cfZ"&gt;Offline viewing is pretty rare among the streaming TV apps. Hulu lets you download on-demand TV shows and movies to watch offline, but this doesn’t apply to recordings from its live TV service. Sling TV offers no such functionality, nor does AT&amp;amp;T TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DP6UyS"&gt;The “add-on package” language suggests you’ll have to pay more than the standard $65 monthly subscription to access these features. YouTube TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;raised its base subscription&lt;/a&gt; to that last June. But the company still advertises that, even as the cost increases, YouTube TV still doesn’t come with any hidden fees and offers unlimited cloud DVR space. The service has over 3 million customers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon won’t build this Alexa cuckoo clock unless it hits a preorder goal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The first three gadgets in Amazon’s “Build It” program" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B4ek-SgKcO1dGh4kLN8NDWGV-_8=/0x331:2369x1910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829743/Build_It_All_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first three gadgets in Amazon’s Build It program.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ZGaQq"&gt;Amazon is launching a new consumer outreach program it’s calling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildIt?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Build It&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is a safer spin on a familiar crowdfunding idea: if enough people preorder something, Amazon will produce it. And if not, it won’t. The company is starting with three Alexa-powered gadgets: a cuckoo clock, a thermal sticky note printer, and a smart scale that can provide details on the food you’re weighing via a separate Echo device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgLgWB"&gt;All three “concepts” are going up for preorder today as part of Amazon’s program for creating experimental hardware. It has already made some devices it doesn’t consider mainstream yet — like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; — under the Day 1 Editions branding. Built It is a subset, designed for gadgets that won’t even be released without proof of demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sh9Tpc"&gt;Where Kickstarter and Indiegogo offer the good vibes of supporting a startup (and the risk that goes along with that), Amazon’s take is simply to display a progress bar of preorders. Customers can cancel their preorder at any time or return the product should it end up being produced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bipaqu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Frames review: listen to these specs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mbcOQ3"&gt;Amazon’s program is presumably designed to pick up the marketing benefits and hype that a product can get from a crowdfunding campaign. It may also be designed to seed the marketplace with more Alexa-powered gadget ideas. In any case, Amazon isn’t looking to “crowdfund” these gadgets, merely gauge customer interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTZtKn"&gt;When asked if Amazon planned to offer Built It campaigns to third-party companies in the future, a spokesperson wouldn’t comment. They also wouldn’t comment on what exactly the preorder goals would be. Rather than displaying a total dollar amount (as in crowdfunding) or even a total number of desired preorders, Build It campaigns will simply display a progress bar with a percentage next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Amazon will only display a percentage of the preorder goal, not specific numbers." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7wTEOykoXocUGdb_8sn5IDIlWpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22308928/Screen_Shot_2021_02_16_at_6.16.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon will only display a percentage of the preorder goal, not specific numbers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPBuV9"&gt;The three products Amazon is starting with all seem like fun gadgets that the company’s hardware division probably would have found a way to release even without the Build It program. All three feature different levels of Alexa integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBBcGw"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartStickyNotePrinter?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sticky note printer&lt;/a&gt; has a preorder price of $89.99. It can print out little reminders or puzzles based on voice commands to Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUY463"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartNutritionScale?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;nutrition scale&lt;/a&gt; has the usual LED display and buttons, but you can also ask Alexa to answer questions about the food that’s set on it. Amazon’s example, “Alexa, ask Smart Scale how much sugar is in these blueberries,” gives you an idea of what you might be able to do. Its preorder price is $34.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0EMWL"&gt;Finally, the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/SmartCuckooClock?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cuckoo clock&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/20/17883414/amazon-echo-wall-clock-led-timers-price-release-date"&gt;first Alexa-powered wall clock&lt;/a&gt;, but it does offer a bunch of customizations. There are 60 LED bulbs, the cuckoo bird itself, and a removable pendulum. Its preorder price is $79.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPSmVf"&gt;In all three cases, you’ll note that the prices here are “preorder” prices. Part of Amazon’s pitch for Build It gadgets is they’ll be less expensive for customers who preorder. Each preorder run will last 30 days, and customers won’t be charged until the product actually ships. Amazon says if these three gadgets meet their goal, it’s tentatively aiming to release them this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will now let you pay for public transportation and parking through its app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Maps" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SOwIGxhancsnr1S5vYXVGscPq3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829742/DSCF2501__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVU5XP"&gt;Google Maps is adding a couple of new useful features: the ability to pay for parking or buy a train ticket right from the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apqmkg"&gt;Google Maps is integrating two mobile parking payment services into its app, &lt;a href="https://www.passportparking.com/"&gt;Passport&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://parkmobile.io/"&gt;ParkMobile&lt;/a&gt;. Both offer the ability to find, pay for, and replenish parking meters or parking lot fees through a smartphone app. Now, those features will also be available in Google Maps. According to the company:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mHL2h7"&gt;Simply tap on the “Pay for Parking” button that appears as you near your destination. Then enter your meter number, the amount of time you want to park for, and tap “Pay.” Need to add more time to your meter? Easily extend your parking session with just a few taps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VNaQuZ"&gt;The ability to pay for parking in Google Maps will be available in 400-plus cities in the US, including Boston, Cincinnati, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Washington, DC, and more, Google said. Android phone users will get the feature first, with iPhone owners soon to follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gsCnar"&gt;&lt;q&gt;80 transit agencies around the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tK1TT8"&gt;Paying for public transportation will work much in the same way. If you are searching for transit directions in Google Maps, you’ll see an option to purchase tickets appear alongside your results. Similar to the pay for parking feature, customers will need to have a Google Pay account linked to a valid credit or debit card to make the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ppe8O7"&gt;Then, customers can use their phone — either in a tap-to-pay situation or by showing a digital ticket to a conductor — to ride public transportation. And in places like the San Francisco Bay Area, customers will be able to buy a digital Clipper card directly from Google Maps. The feature will be available to use in over 80 transit systems around the world, Google says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hlx9Po"&gt;A number of transit agencies around the world have modernized their fare collection methods to include contactless or tap-to-pay mediums like Google Pay and Apple Pay. Some that rely on weekly or monthly passes, like London’s Oyster card or San Francisco’s Clipper card, have also started working with Apple and Google Pay to integrate those payment passes in their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgBIvy"&gt;It’s the latest feature in Google Maps’ ongoing effort to make itself more user-friendly for commuters and transit riders. In 2019, it added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761187/google-maps-transit-crowded-delays-predictions-train-bus-subway"&gt;new transit crowdedness predictions&lt;/a&gt;, allowing customers to see how crowded their bus, train, or tube is likely to be before heading out on their commute. It also added a feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20835131/google-maps-combine-transit-biking-ride-sharing"&gt;pairs transit directions with biking and ride-sharing options&lt;/a&gt; so customers can get directions using a variety of transportation modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52thSC"&gt;Google isn’t the only tech giant attempting to appeal to transit riders. Uber and Lyft have both recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205154/uber-public-transportation-app-denver"&gt;started integrating transit directions&lt;/a&gt; into their respective apps. Customers who live in Denver can even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687461/uber-public-transportation-tickets-sold-denver"&gt;purchase train tickets&lt;/a&gt; using their Uber account. Both companies are building sophisticated algorithms that rely on reams of data from transit agencies pertaining to routes and schedules. Moreover, it’s a race among tech giants to become a one-stop shop for transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVPCKg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos confirms March 9th product launch, hints at smaller portable speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIgRg5nUduOR7-D_twQNzeM0g_E=/0x7:1776x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829722/sonosedit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bs1l6q"&gt;Sonos will announce its next new product on March 9th, the company confirmed today. The invite for the launch shows a person out in a field — strongly hinting that the device will be portable. My guess is it’s something that would fit in that shoulder bag. A recent Federal Communications Commission filing from Sonos revealed that it’s preparing to release what looks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22269050/sonos-fcc-filing-mini-move-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;a smaller battery-powered speaker&lt;/a&gt;. Documents show the device to use Bluetooth and have a wireless charging stand much like the existing Sonos Move, which sells for $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeTy7n"&gt;Sonos is also developing a pair of premium noise-canceling headphones, which recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;made another appearance&lt;/a&gt; at the German Patent and Trademark Office. It looks like the design is almost final, and those would also fit the outdoor nature of this invite. But Sonos CEO Patrick Spence specified on the company’s latest quarterly earnings call that there’s only one new product coming in March. So it’s going to be one or the other. My money would be on the speaker being more likely, but we’ll see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niePE5"&gt;The most recent hardware releases from Sonos include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279703/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-price-specs-features"&gt;Sonos Arc soundbar&lt;/a&gt; with Dolby Atmos, the Sonos Five (a revamped version of the Play:5 speaker), and a refreshed Sonos Sub. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas’ natural gas production just froze under pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Winter Storm Uri Brings Ice And Snow Across Widespread Parts Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krJXMn8bIJuCEPc9kH-WKKeA1vg=/198x0:4602x2936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68829697/1231205567.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pike Electric service trucks line up after a snowstorm on February 16th, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas. Winter storm Uri has brought historic cold weather and power outages to Texas as storms have swept across 26 states with a mix of freezing temperatures and precipitation.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Ron Jenkins / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7RpdWU"&gt;Natural gas wells and pipes ill-equipped for cold weather are a big reason why millions of Texans lost power during frigid temperatures this week. As temperatures dropped to record lows across some parts of the state, liquid inside wells, pipes, and valves froze solid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jHuVH"&gt;Ice can block gas flow, clogging pipes. It’s a phenomenon called a “freeze-off” that disrupts gas production across the US every winter. But freeze-offs can have outsized effects in Texas, as we’ve seen this week. The state is a huge natural gas producer — and it doesn’t usually have to deal with such cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ph2i6P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Texas relies on natural gas more than any other fuel for its electricity generation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zlnXfC"&gt;“When we think about what’s been going on in the last week and why it’s turned the market completely on its head is the fact that the freeze offs are occurring in Texas,” says Erika Coombs, director of oil &amp;amp; gas products at research firm BTU Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qrdn4X"&gt;Texas relies on natural gas more than any other fuel for its electricity generation. Gas generated nearly half of the state’s electricity in 2019, &lt;a href="https://comptroller.texas.gov/economy/fiscal-notes/2020/august/ercot.php"&gt;according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas&lt;/a&gt; (ERCOT). Wind and coal each accounted for about 20 percent of electricity generation that year, while nuclear made up about another 10 percent. While nuclear and wind power have been hampered by the storm, &lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/news/releases/show/225210"&gt;neither frigid nuclear plants nor frozen wind turbines&lt;/a&gt; bear the largest share of responsibility for Texas’ power problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLcaL0"&gt;“It appears that a lot of the generation that has gone offline today has been primarily due to issues on the natural gas system,” Dan Woodfin, senior director of system operations at ERCOT, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a call with reporters on February 16th, &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Texas Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiJScu"&gt;While the frigid cold slashed fuel supplies of all sorts, it also drove up demand for natural gas to heat homes. That “mismatch” is what’s driving these blackouts, says Coombs. There simply hasn’t been enough fuel on hand to power the state’s electricity needs. Natural gas production was pretty much halved in Texas and its gas-rich Permian Basin during the recent cold and stormy weather. It fell from 22.5 billion cubic feet of gas produced per day in December to between 10 to 12 billion cubic feet of gas per day this week, according to estimates from BTU Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys1U9y"&gt;That drop-off in production is thanks to freeze-offs at wellheads where oil and gas are pumped out of the ground. But the cold has also stopped equipment from working properly at gas processing plants, Coombs says. Processing plants separate gas from fluid and impurities; when equipment freezes, plants have to heat it up or wait for temperatures to rise before they can resume their work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps9Ar5"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yw5XcV"&gt;While other states invest more in equipment that helps prevent freeze-offs, Texas hasn’t seen the need. North Dakota typically sees 20 days a year with freeze-off events, while the Permian Basin would normally have just four days a year with freeze-offs disrupting gas production, according to BTU Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA11sx"&gt;“With gas prices being low – and storage being full – the risk of 2-3 days of possible freeze-off every several years is a risk that Gulf Coast producers have been willing to take,” a &lt;a href="http://www.ercot.com/content/committees/other/lts/keydocs/2013/BV_ERCOT_Gas_Study_Appendix_A.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on freeze-offs prepared for ERCOT in 2013 says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="YTQlsU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A risk that Gulf Coast producers have been willing to take”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCinFG"&gt;The last time Texas experienced anything close to the energy crisis it’s experiencing this week was probably &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=230"&gt;in 2011&lt;/a&gt;, when freezing temperatures lowered monthly gas supplies by about &lt;a href="https://btuanalytics.com/natural-gas-pricing/permian-freeze-offs-ahead/"&gt;10 percent&lt;/a&gt;. That year, the US Energy Information Administration &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=3390"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that energy disruptions from gas well freeze-offs rivaled interruptions from hurricanes and tropical storms. Since then, average daily gas production in the Permian Basin has more than tripled. That’s another reason why freeze-offs are a bigger problem in Texas now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jjCPW"&gt;They aren’t the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; problem when it comes to energy in Texas. The power outages &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/natural-gas-power-storm/"&gt;have also stopped natural gas pumping facilities&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, over the past few days, just about everything that could go wrong &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-17/in-texas-s-black-swan-blackout-everything-went-wrong-at-once"&gt;has failed spectacularly&lt;/a&gt;. And the &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/Texas-grid-again-faces-scrutiny-over-cold-15955392.php"&gt;finger-pointing is only getting started&lt;/a&gt;. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called for an investigation into why blackouts were so widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAtdyL"&gt;“This was a total failure by ERCOT,” Abbott told &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-ercot/"&gt;KTRK Houston&lt;/a&gt;. “ERCOT stands for Electric Reliability Council of Texas, and they showed that they were not reliable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bn0P7d"&gt;Meanwhile, millions of people in Texas remain without power as a &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2021/02/15/one-down-one-to-go-another-winter-storm-could-dump-5-more-inches-of-snow-on-dallas-fort-worth/"&gt;second winter storm sweeps through the state&lt;/a&gt;. As of Tuesday night, there was &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2021/02/16/ercot-says-they-have-no-idea-when-texas-power-outages-will-end/"&gt;still no indication of when the outages would end&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
