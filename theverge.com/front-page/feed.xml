    <title>The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Get some peace and quiet with the best noise-canceling headphones for a variety of uses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="X1sCH7"&gt;Whether you’re wearing them for the morning commute, while traveling, or if you’re simply trying to find some peace and quiet while working at home, noise-canceling headphones are a more essential piece of kit nowadays than ever before. And you’ve got a slew of great options to pick from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLU1nQ"&gt;No matter how you’re using them, the criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones haven’t changed: the most important measures are comfort, how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, and whether they support multipoint pairing so you can connect to two audio sources at once. The right headphones for you will differ based on which of those things you prioritize, but our overall pick for the best noise-canceling headphones is&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They offer a good mix of sound quality, everyday durability, and great noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XtIOrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4dlNC4"&gt;But if you’re looking for something a bit different, there are still plenty of options. If you want supreme comfort during those long-haul flights, Bose’s QuietComfort 45s are the answer. If you’re an iPhone owner and will only settle for the best, the AirPods Max live up to their price. But Sennheiser and Shure also sell some tremendous ANC headphones if sound quality is your main focus. Trying to find the best headphones for Zoom life? Microsoft and Bose both have strong contenders. And if you’re after something a little more stylish, Marshall’s headphones just might surprise you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s 1000XM4 headphones remain the overall best noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIBBVA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="49SoTG"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 might look identical to the previous 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjKN0Y"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the marathon 30-hour battery life. But Sony addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued into what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8iloOp"&gt;Sony also has a really unique trick for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking, which is handy when you’re grabbing a coffee. And unlike their predecessors, the 1000XM4s can tell when they’ve been removed from your ears for auto-pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zwdkfG"&gt;The most comfortable noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZQ58k"&gt;Bose’s QC45 headphones are a return to form in the best way. They have a design that’s very similar to the QC35II, meaning they’re remarkably light and comfortable on your head even when worn for an entire day. The oval ear cups never fatigue your ears, and no one can match Bose when it comes to comfort. Best of all, unlike the Noise Canceling Headphones 700, these can be folded to make them easier to travel with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcpUoW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZDlqa"&gt;Bose made modest improvements to the active noise cancellation and stretched battery life to 24 hours from the previous 20. The QC45s also have a USB-C port instead of the Micro USB connector of their predecessors. And they add a transparency mode for when you need to have a quick chat with someone or want more awareness of your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTkhOA"&gt;Sound quality on the QC45s is a little more even-handed than the bassy Sony 1000XM4s. And unfortunately, Bose doesn’t offer EQ customization for these headphones at the moment. Another frustration is that there’s no way to turn off noise cancellation without activating the transparency mode. It’s one or the other with no basic “off” mode. I’m still hoping Bose will address both of these shortcomings with future software updates, but you shouldn’t count on that.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Max don’t come cheap, but they’re the best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TSER3c"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;Apple AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="AXEBd8"&gt;There was definitely some sticker shock when Apple introduced a $549 set of noise-canceling headphones. The AirPods Max cost significantly more money than any of our other recommendations. But Apple’s build quality is on another level: these trade the plastic you’ll find in many noise-canceling headphones for steel and aluminum, and the ear cups are a breathable mesh fabric. They’re hefty headphones, there’s no denying that. But aside from Apple refusing to include a headphone cable in the box, there’s nothing about the AirPods Max that feels cheap. And I appreciate the simplicity of using the digital crown for controls instead of relying on hit-or-miss gestures like taps and swipes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KK007J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2d4O3y"&gt;The most important part is that the AirPods Max deliver the best audio quality you can get from high-end Bluetooth headphones. They have an immersive, wide soundstage, fantastic dynamics, and you’ll find yourself hopping around your music library just to hear what they bring out in your favorite songs. Apple’s noise cancellation is right up there with Sony and Bose, and no one does transparency mode better; at times, it can make you think you’re not wearing headphones at all. Extra features like Spatial Audio (surround sound for movies and TV shows) and automatic switching between Apple gadgets help make it a bit easier to swallow that daunting price.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVlWWZ"&gt;But the AirPods Max do have faults. The carrying case is abysmal, battery life is only average for the category, and just like regular AirPods, they’re designed with Apple’s ecosystem in mind. It gets much harder to justify dropping $550 on them if you live outside the iPhone and Mac universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shure’s first noise-canceling headphones offer fantastic build quality and support for codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VlEuiu"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum Wireless 3&lt;/a&gt; and Shure Aonic 50&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best sounding noise-canceling headphones if you’re not an Apple user&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hSuEdn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y9HzOw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361649"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 have intuitive dial controls and are a joy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SrU1nv"&gt;5.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267032/microsoft-surface-headphones-2-review-noise-canceling-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GtniNJ"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made noticeable improvements to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dI25d6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. Something about the way Microsoft handles simultaneous Bluetooth connections seems more reliable and consistent than what everyone else is doing. It’s rare that I encounter any bugs when connected to two devices at once. It’s hard to oversell this benefit during work-at-home life, and you get the convenience for much less cash than the Sony or Bose headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3Wkxfb"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S81Mb_nBDFuDKCiKjN7p5Jm8EfA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16322317/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are excellent for all your Zoom and voice call needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0FRbZM"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OJVxE6"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2PK7eH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rcxziF"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones have a stylish design that ties into the company’s history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F7quUY"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage. The headphones fold up for easy carrying, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;Marshall’s signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f6QyVt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361724"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFNLUi"&gt;They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. That impressive longevity beats our primary picks. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yCIIeqMVYzyGtIEBrmb6249_ICM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123523/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature to get you off the app | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RAaowz"&gt;Head of Instagram Adam Mosseri said Wednesday that the platform is testing the long-awaited Take a Break feature to give users reminders when they’ve spent a long time on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnJUDv"&gt;“It does what you think it does,” Mosseri said in a video posted to Twitter. “If you opt in, it encourages you to take a break from Instagram after you spend a certain amount of time on the app; 10, 20, or 30 minutes,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dBSa93"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Testing “Take a Break”  ‍ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We started testing a new feature called “Take a Break” this week. This opt-in control enables you to receive break reminders in-app after a duration of your choosing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m excited to dig into the results &amp;amp; hopefully launch this sometime in December. ✌  &lt;a href="https://t.co/WdSTjL6ZdH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WdSTjL6ZdH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jrDUFf"&gt;The feature is “part of a broader effort to try and give people more control over their experience of Instagram,” Mosseri added. “Ultimately, you know what’s best for you when it comes to how you use the app. And we want to make sure we provide tools for you to shape Instagram into what works for you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRCFio"&gt;The testing of a Take a Break feature comes amid intense scrutiny on Instagram and its parent company Meta (formerly Facebook) after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about the company’s internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;. Teenagers told the company’s researchers that they felt “addicted” to Instagram but didn’t have the self-control to reduce their usage even though they would have preferred to check the app less often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG6Yyc"&gt;The company’s vice president of global affairs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;Nick Clegg, said on CNN&lt;/a&gt; last month that it was working on the Take a Break feature along with similar features, all with teenagers in mind. When its systems “see that a teenager is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other content,” Clegg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS75NZ"&gt;A company spokesperson confirmed that users will have to opt in to the feature to activate it but said in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it would be “sending teens a notification urging them to turn it on.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVO50JQH_2kif6qppSRMLD3z6hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003109/Screen_Shot_2021_11_10_at_10.45.34_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram is testing a Take a Break feature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1WBkCi"&gt;The glimpses of the feature in Mosseri’s video show the prompt will display in users’ feeds but won’t take over the entire screen. So, in theory, someone could scroll right past it. If they choose “turn on,” they’ll then be prompted to choose what length of time they want to spend on the app before they receive the reminder. The reminder will then pop up with a list of suggestions: “take a few deep breaths, write down what you’re thinking, listen to your favorite song, do something on your to-do list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR9QQu"&gt;Mosseri said Instagram worked with third-party experts for advice on what tips to offer and how to frame taking a break. If the company is “comfortable” with the feature, it could launch wider next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All I want from my smartwatch is to give me a break</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYbG6P4U6tDWfHHgcHpHIUk8Hvg=/0x0:4031x2687/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123434/IMG_1982__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s rings are a good motivator, until they aren’t&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HD0wue"&gt;If there’s one thing wearable makers learned during the pandemic, it’s that people are stressed out — and with good reason. It’s led to companies like Fitbit and Apple expanding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22295768/fitbit-premium-mindful-method-deepak-chopra-wellness-series"&gt;stress management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/fitness-plus-introduces-workouts-and-meditations-with-shareplay/"&gt;mindfulness features&lt;/a&gt; in their most recent products and services. But while it’s encouraging to see wearables makers acknowledge that mental health is part of overall health, there’s still one major oversight: modern wearables are fundamentally centered around building and maintaining streaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyNY0e"&gt;Whether it’s hitting your daily 10,000 steps, burning a certain number of calories, or reminders to move every hour, the aim for most wearables is to help you build better health habits. To do that, consistency is key. No one’s denying that. But any athlete or doctor will also tell you that &lt;a href="https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/the_importance_of_rest_and_recovery_for_athletes#:~:text=Rest%20and%20recovery%20is%20an,especially%20for%20high%20level%20athletes.&amp;amp;text=The%20body%20is%20allowed%20to,the%20body%20tissue%20to%20repair."&gt;rest and recovery are incredibly important&lt;/a&gt; to your overall health, preventing injuries, and avoiding motivational burnout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb9C6C"&gt;Unfortunately, most wearables fail at giving you a break, even when it’s justified. It’s simply not built into their programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yLq0e"&gt;Take the Apple Watch. Apple’s Fitness app revolves around closing three rings: the Move ring for calories burned, Exercise for minutes spent being active, and Stand for how many hours you stand in a day. In the Awards section, you can earn badges like “Longest Move Streak” and “Perfect Week” for each ring. Essentially, you’re rewarded for meeting daily goals over a long period of time — regardless of whether that’s what your body and mind needs at the moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/caEzOFrtaO72sIyHt6vDZ79ve1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13111179/vpavic_180917_2949_0062.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch prioritizes consistency above all else.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lyjizD"&gt;Apple’s not the only one guilty of this. Fitbit, Garmin, and every other fitness tracker under the sun also use gamification as a motivational tool. While it can feel amazing when you’re in the zone, it can ironically be demotivating when you break a streak for reasons outside your control. And the longer the streak, the more demotivating it becomes when you inevitably break it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNri9l"&gt;Being a wearables reviewer means I’m hyper consistent with a training schedule. However, even I occasionally fall ill, get injured, or have a major life event that necessitates falling off the horse for an extended period of time. In those instances, it’d be more useful if I could just hit a “pause” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tqnkc"&gt;Earlier this year, I got too caught up in keeping a streak going, which in turn led me to ignore signs I was overdoing my training. The result was a nasty case of shin splints. Common sense dictated I lay off my regimen until I was fully healed. That said, it was hard not to feel the sting of breaking a 90-day streak even though I was doing the best thing for my health. This scenario isn’t rare. Peruse any smartwatch or fitness forum and you’ll find people &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleWatch/comments/bza8ye/apple_watch_on_sick_days/"&gt;fretting about streaks&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/healthandwellness/f/vivoactive-3-3-music/270906/are-you-ever-gonna-fix-the-10-000-steps-streak-issue"&gt;obsessing over&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firstworldproblems/comments/l9tqou/i_misplaced_my_smart_watch_charger_and_now_my/"&gt;losing “credit”&lt;/a&gt; for an arbitrary goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="61g0Yr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fitbit moved away from arbitrary step counts and now prioritizes minutes of activity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jwgUyR"&gt;This isn’t to say wearables companies and fitness apps aren’t moving in the right direction. With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Fitbit Charge 4&lt;/a&gt;, the company moved away from its arbitrary 10,000-step goal toward a new metric called &lt;a href="https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/1379.htm"&gt;Active Zone Minutes (AZM)&lt;/a&gt;. What made this shift notable is AZM focuses on your weekly activity level, as opposed to daily streaks. This year, the company also added something it calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22765408/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-electrocardiogram-app-daily-readiness-score"&gt;a Daily Readiness Score&lt;/a&gt;, which helps users decide how active they should be based on their body’s signals and prior activity. In watchOS 6, Apple added a Trends tab that contextualized your progress over the past 90 days compared to your yearly average. This year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8 update&lt;/a&gt; also added a host of mindfulness tools, but they’re more focused on meditation than recovery. (The Apple Watch’s native sleep tracking also still leaves a lot to be desired.) These are all steps in the right direction, but most mainstream wearables still don’t have a way to stay motivated without penalizing you for needing a physical or mental break every now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmqYer"&gt;The wearable that comes closest is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22740187/oura-period-prediction-heart-rate-smart-ring"&gt;recovery-focused Oura Ring&lt;/a&gt;. It defines a “good” activity score as hitting a calorie goal three to four times a week, and last year, it added a new &lt;a href="https://ouraring.com/blog/ouras-new-rest-mode-helps-optimize-your-recovery/"&gt;Rest Mode&lt;/a&gt;. In Rest Mode, the ring snoozes your activity goals and readjusts your scores to prioritize recovery. But the Oura Ring is also a niche health wearable that lacks many of the smart features people have come to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkVTL6"&gt;Smartwatches and fitness trackers can be excellent tools for anyone looking to build better habits. But people aren’t machines, and they don’t need to be shamed for breaking streaks or losing some fitness during a recovery period. This is doubly true for those dealing with life’s tribulations. No one wants to get a reminder to move when they’re at a funeral or going through a rough time. You should be able to hit a button that pauses streaks, mutes motivational reminders, and ideally, automatically sets easier goals based on your metrics when you’re finally ready to get back to your usual routine. Maybe then, people would feel less inclined to give up and let their trackers collect dust in a drawer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Deck launch delayed by two months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JQXkPMe7D2SBY00KrWBONjROKNc=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123395/steam_deck.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck, which has been delayed to February.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZGLGPc"&gt;Valve is delaying the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, its handheld gaming PC, by two months. The Steam Deck had been set to launch in December, but Valve now estimates that the first orders will start shipping in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwTjy"&gt;“We’re sorry about this — we did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712"&gt;Valve said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wjuL3"&gt;One editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is now seeing a Q1 2022 estimated ship date for a Steam Deck reservation that was originally slated for the December launch window. Another is seeing a Q2 2022 estimated ship date for an order that was initially going to arrive in Q1. (Both placed their reservation on the very first day that Valve opened preorders.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PtYohDgb_-iSBF6qSjyR17_-8fA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23003117/image__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister/The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valve is still showing “After Q2 2022” for new orders, the same as it showed yesterday, but the initial shipments have been bumped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Alj37E"&gt;The global supply chain shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive impact&lt;/a&gt; on the technology industry. Next-gen consoles and Nvidia 30-series graphics cards have been famously difficult to buy for going on a year, BMW said last week that some new cars won’t have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;touchscreens because of chip shortages&lt;/a&gt;, and even Apple has felt the sting, saying that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;lost $6 billion&lt;/a&gt; to supply chain constraints in its most recent quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKNjBk"&gt;“While we did our best to account for the global supply chain issues (by which we mean we factored in extra time to account for these risks and worked with multiple component vendors), our manufacturing plans were still impacted,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;Valve said in the Steam Deck FAQ&lt;/a&gt;. “Material shortages and delays meant that components weren’t making it to our manufacturing facilities on time. Missing parts along with logistical challenges means delayed Steam Decks, so we needed to push out shipping by two months to February.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="r3TkdI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iwlPqw"&gt;Chip shortages aren’t the only thing Valve is squaring away before the Steam Deck’s launch — it’s also trying to ensure developers flip any necessary switches and make any necessary modifications to ensure their Windows games run on the Linux handheld. A Proton compatibility layer does most of the heavy lifting, but online multiplayer games sometimes come with anti-cheat software that historically didn’t work well with Proton, and games may want to embrace the Deck’s touchscreen, joysticks, and buttons as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ta8xwX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733408/steam-deck-compatibility-verified-pc-gaming-valve"&gt;Valve introduced a “Verified” program last month&lt;/a&gt; for games that work well on Deck and has worked with top anti-cheat platforms Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) and BattlEye to enable support. EAC owner Epic Games says flipping on support takes just a few clicks on the developer end; Valve says BattlEye is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22737127/valve-steam-deck-battleye-anti-cheat-pubg-dayz-r6-siege"&gt;as easy as sending an email&lt;/a&gt;. Despite that, some top Steam game developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709918/valve-steam-deck-supported-games-anti-cheat-proton-eac-battleye-epic"&gt;haven’t yet been willing to voice support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD8p59"&gt;Valve is holding &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017?emclan=103582791433666425&amp;amp;emgid=3104662546549776336"&gt;a virtual developer event on Friday&lt;/a&gt; for the Steam Deck, sharing best practices and answering developer questions. The company already sent out early Steam Deck units to developers months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZzJiD7"&gt;

    <title>Uber discriminates against people with disabilities, new DOJ lawsuit alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5WCcTIzQFzaJWh5uWeZAs9EBLE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123274/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fWObmA"&gt;Uber discriminates against people with disabilities by charging them a “wait time” fee while entering the vehicle, according to a new lawsuit filed by the US Justice Department against the ride-hailing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa9oqJ"&gt;These extra fees have “harmed many passengers and potential passengers with disabilities throughout the country,” some of whom may be entitled to monetary damages, the department said. The lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for Northern California, alleges that Uber is in violation of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which prohibits discrimination by private transportation companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZzFsgJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8oqEpI"&gt;According to the Justice Department, Uber instituted a wait time fee in a number of cities starting in April 2016, eventually expanding the policy nationwide. Passengers would incur the fee two minutes after their Uber car arrives at their pickup location and were charged until the car begins its trip. Passengers with disabilities, such as those who use a wheelchair or a walker, often need more time to get into the car than passengers without disabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baXH6R"&gt;“People with disabilities deserve equal access to all areas of community life, including the private transportation services provided by companies like Uber,” said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke for the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-uber-overcharging-people-disabilities"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. Clarke said the goal of the lawsuit is to send a “powerful message that Uber cannot penalize passengers with disabilities simply because they need more time to get into a car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuFsEO"&gt;A spokesperson for Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wnuah"&gt;Uber has a fairly abysmal record when it comes to serving its passengers with disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/28/15888508/uber-equal-rights-center-lawsuit-wheelchair-accessibility-uberx"&gt;The company was sued by disability advocates&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, in which it was accused of denying equal access to people who use wheelchairs and violating the ADA. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17384600/uber-lyft-wheelchair-accessible-fail-nyc-report"&gt;A report detailed&lt;/a&gt; excessively long wait times for wheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAV) in New York City. And Uber sued New York City to block the implementation of a new rule requiring ride-hailing companies to make wheelchair-accessible service a part of their operations. (The company and the city later &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/city-hall/story/2018/06/13/new-york-city-and-uber-reach-settlement-on-wheelchair-accessibility-466459"&gt;agreed to a settlement&lt;/a&gt; exempting Uber and Lyft from the WAV requirement.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0VOkCN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber has a fairly abysmal record when it comes to serving its passengers with disabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrlDxd"&gt;Uber has also faced civil action over its poor record serving customers with disabilities. A lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.inquirer.com/transportation/uber-ride-share-wheelchair-access-disabled-suit-allegheny-pittsburgh-20190614.html"&gt;filed in Pennsylvania in 2019&lt;/a&gt; accused the company of failing to ensure that people in wheelchairs receive equal service from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6CEIM"&gt;A federal lawsuit obviously raises the legal stakes for Uber. The Justice Department is not only seeking monetary damages for affected passengers but also a court order forcing the company to comply with the ADA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QSyLG"&gt;The lawsuit references a 52-year-old woman from Miami with a spinal injury who uses a motorized wheelchair, detailing how it would take on average five minutes or longer for her to board an Uber vehicle. The woman noticed that she was incurring fees for the added time but was denied a refund from Uber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnt1V5"&gt;The woman, who is only referred to as “Passenger A,” “felt angry and upset that Uber has charged her wait time fees for her daily rides to her rehabilitation appointments,” the &lt;a href="https://www.ada.gov/uber_comp.pdf"&gt;lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;. “Uber’s refusal to refund her money or to change its wait time fee policy makes Passenger A feel like a second-class citizen.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams share buttons will appear in Windows 11 soon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3GFgBI"&gt;Microsoft is adding a useful new Microsoft Teams integration into Windows 11 soon. The software maker has started testing a feature in Windows 11 that will allow Teams users to hover over open windows on the taskbar and quickly share the window content on a Microsoft Teams call. It will make screen sharing a lot easier for Teams and other communication apps on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dtp59a"&gt;Microsoft is testing this initially with Microsoft Teams for work or school rather than the built-in consumer version of Teams in Windows 11. “This means not everyone will see this right away with their Teams calls,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/10/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22499/"&gt;says Amanda Langowski&lt;/a&gt;, head of Microsoft’s Windows Insider program. “We plan to bring this to Chat from Microsoft Teams (Microsoft Teams for home) later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vDxRoH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zoom, Slack, and others will be free to add this integration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQ2SPB"&gt;The good news is that this won’t be limited to Microsoft Teams, either. “Other communications applications can also add this capability to their applications,” explains Langowski. “The capability to share your meeting call applies only to your current meeting call.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TTVdV"&gt;That means apps like Slack or Zoom could build this functionality into their apps and make it a lot easier for Windows 11 users to share what’s on their screen during video calls. It’s not clear exactly when Microsoft will deliver this functionality in Windows 11, but it’s likely to appear in early 2022, given the timing of testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Zd3R"&gt;Microsoft is also only testing this with a subset of Windows Insiders, so having the Dev Channel builds of Windows 11 installed doesn’t guarantee you’ll be able to test it just yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash will acquire European delivery company Wolt as it builds a global platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0F6mQRVns4lSCeGZ_UOm-LGKbwo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123040/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1neYDT"&gt;DoorDash has agreed to acquire the food delivery company Wolt for €7 billion (about $8.1 billion) with plans to expand its reach to Europe (via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/09/doordash-to-acquire-food-delivery-company-wolt/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://wolt.com/en/about"&gt;Founded in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, Wolt is a Finland-based company that contracts out couriers to deliver takeout, groceries, and other goods to customers in 23 countries mainly throughout Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYLmul"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Joins-Forces-with-Wolt/default.aspx"&gt;DoorDash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.wolt.com/hq/2021/11/09/wolt-joins-forces-with-doordash/"&gt;Wolt&lt;/a&gt; announced the all-stock transaction in separate blog posts, confirming a move that will bring DoorDash to Europe for the first time. Currently, DoorDash is only available in cities across the US, Canada, Japan, and Australia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJrzo0"&gt;“By joining forces, we believe we will accelerate our product development, bring greater focus to each of our markets, and improve the value we provide to consumers, merchants, as well as Dashers and couriers around the world,” says Tony Xu, the co-founder and CEO of DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MO7VeG"&gt;All of Wolt’s 4,000 employees will remain active under DoorDash, including Wolt co-founder and CEO Miki Kuusi, who will serve as the head of DoorDash International. The deal is set to officially close in the second half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0aB53T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;DoorDash has eaten up smaller companies in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nODVE8"&gt;Along with announcing its acquisition of Wolt, DoorDash also released its &lt;a href="https://ir.doordash.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"&gt;third-quarter earnings for 2021&lt;/a&gt;. DoorDash’s revenue grew 45 percent year over year to $1.3 billion, quite a leap from $879 million in 2020. Its total number of orders also grew 44 percent year over year from 236 million to 347 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wu0SC1"&gt;DoorDash has eaten up smaller companies in the past, acquiring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750755/doordash-caviar-acquisition-square-food-delivery-apps"&gt;food delivery service Caviar&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and buying out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272746/doordash-chowbotics-acquisition-salad-robot"&gt;robot salad-making company Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826327/doordash-acquires-scotty-labs-autonomous-vehicle-remote-control-startup"&gt;DoorDash also acquired Scotty Labs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 — a startup that builds remote-controlled vehicles — to work toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;its dream of autonomous deliveries&lt;/a&gt;. In 2017, DoorDash tried out humanless deliveries with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14300054/food-delivery-robots-postmates-doordash-us-launch"&gt;semi-autonomous six-wheeled robots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166660/gm-cruise-doordash-test-self-driving-food-delivery"&gt;partnered with GM&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to deliver food with an autonomous vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frBuOA"&gt;It looks like DoorDash is still focusing on its human couriers — for now at least. Earlier this month, DoorDash rolled out a set of features, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763690/doordash-safety-button-delivery-worker-rights-accountability-adt-911"&gt;called SafeDash, a safety button that puts couriers in contact with ADT&lt;/a&gt; (or lets them call 911 through ADT) during an emergency. However, some argue that having an app that calls 911 for you probably isn’t more helpful than simply calling 911 yourself and suggest systemic changes to keep couriers safe like allowing them to decline dangerous routes without the threat of a penalty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n8k55W2Y7ME6-g842TXKjZEed7c=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70123010/2022_Rivian_R1T_17.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mFyrrP"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Rivian is now a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. Rivian shares started trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange Wednesday at around $78 per share. That gave Rivian an overall valuation of nearly $80 billion and helped it net $12 billion in fresh cash, despite the fact that it only just recently started to make and ship its first electric pickup trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEODrf"&gt;It’s the sixth-largest IPO ever on a US stock exchange, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-09/ev-maker-rivian-is-said-to-guide-ipo-price-above-top-of-range?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s hard to imagine the company picking a better time to debut. Tesla has generated an incredible amount of interest in electric vehicles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;is now one of the most highly valued companies in the world. The public markets have also been on an outrageous run over the last few years — a run that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744728/money-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks"&gt;supercharged over the last 18 months by an influx of retail traders&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;boom in electric vehicle companies going public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwLg6W"&gt;Rivian, which has a steady CEO and founder and relatively modest goals for the next few years, could be a good test of all that hype. It has received a little more than 55,000 preorders for its pricey electric pickup truck (the R1T) and SUV (the R1S) and has said it won’t be able to deliver all of those until the end of 2023. Where other EV startups went public with big promises of near-term growth, Rivian has been very conservative in the few estimates it’s offered for what the next few years look like and has instead emphasized that it will be largely focused on making vans for Amazon, which owns about 20 percent of the startup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAn7ER"&gt;And yet, shares of Rivian jumped to $106 as they began trading on the Nasdaq exchange Wednesday and climbed from there, lifting the company’s valuation well over $100 billion — higher than all other automakers on the planet, save for Tesla, Toyota, Volkswagen, and China’s BYD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tm4AkV"&gt;Rivian’s eye-watering valuation will likely reinforce lazy comparisons to Tesla, despite the fact that the startup is beginning production at a time when there’s an observable desire for electric vehicles — which wasn’t the case when Tesla started out, to put it mildly. And while many will likely view Rivian’s valuation as a prime example of how hot the stock market is, at least one legacy automaker has already tried to make the case that it’s justified: General Motors CEO Mary Barra said Wednesday that Rivian’s valuation proves that older automakers are “so undervalued.” (GM nearly had a deal in place to become a major investor in Rivian in 2019 before the startup backed out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768373/go-read-this-gm-deal-ford-rivian-fell-apart"&gt;took on money from its crosstown rival, Ford&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Umjbsy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s IPO filing reveals Amazon’s prime influence","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711196/rivian-s-1-ipo-amazon-ford-r1t-electric-pickup-truck"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zY6Zwr"&gt;Either way, the splashy debut is sure to draw a lot of attention to the startup and its electric vehicles. It has also provided Rivian with a crucial windfall, as it needs a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of money to grow — and survive — in the notoriously cash-hungry automotive business. Rivian lost $994 million in the first six months of 2021 alone and has said in regulatory filings that it expects to spend another $8 billion by the end of 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLcfm1"&gt;The startup wants to make as many as 1 million vehicles per year by 2030 and says it will have all three different vehicles in production by the end of this year. It plans to sell non-delivery versions of its van &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22765853/rivian-fleet-sales-amazon-exclusivity-van-r1t-r1s"&gt;to other customers within the next two years&lt;/a&gt;. It’s even searching for a location to build a second factory in addition to the one it operates in Normal, Illinois. And it’s already carrying a staff of nearly 10,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKTP6e"&gt;Originally founded in 2009, Rivian spent nearly a decade operating in stealth mode. CEO and founder RJ Scaringe initially wanted to make an electric sports car more or less similar to the Tesla Roadster. But he nixed that plan along the way and shifted the company toward developing an electric pickup truck and an SUV. The R1T and R1S, as they’re respectively called, made their debut at the 2018 LA Auto Show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k89tAY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck took me to the top of the mountain","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Nx8cZI"&gt;Rivian’s profile started to take off shortly after. In early 2019, it announced a $700 million funding round led by Amazon and then a $500 million investment from Ford. Later that year, Amazon announced it was helping Rivian develop an electric delivery van and that it was ordering 100,000 of them from the startup, marking what would be the largest single purchase of electric vehicles in history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCd6ye"&gt;Now, with its pickup trucks starting to hit the road and the van and SUV soon to follow, Rivian has become something that is still rare in the industry: a publicly traded EV company with actual vehicles to sell. That’s something that startups like Faraday Future, Canoo, Fisker Inc., Lordstown Motors, and Nikola — which all went public within the last year-and-a-half — are still months away from being able to say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lego is now letting you preorder unofficial sets, including an epic Lego store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-8VvRE_tQGyvDTYWxxnMsztQNQo=/0x50:1200x850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122964/lego_store_bricklink.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zuliKf"&gt;What do a Lego store, a beautiful abandoned windmill, a retro bowling alley, a miniature aquarium, and a pair of Venetian houses have in common? They’ve all just become incredibly limited edition Lego sets &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/introducing.page"&gt;that you can preorder from the Lego company itself&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSeXpV"&gt;They started out as candidates for Lego’s Ideas program, got rejected, and now, they’ve been crowdfunded back to life by fans like you through a separate competition &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/blogs/a4ae09b6-0d4c-4307-9da8-3ee9f3d368d6/post/7e027d01-6ec9-473c-b6b0-db8f92bbe5af"&gt;called the BrickLink Designer Program&lt;/a&gt; that gives creators 10 percent of the proceeds for their work. That means you have a short window of opportunity to snap up these unofficial official sets for yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u2kXr"&gt;And if you’ll allow me to indulge myself, they are &lt;em&gt;glorious&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvaIKm"&gt;Atop this post, you’ll spot the &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/v3/designer-program/designer-sets-for-adult-fans-of-lego/215728/Modular-LEGO-Store"&gt;$179.99 Modular Lego Store&lt;/a&gt;, originally submitted to Lego’s Ideas program &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/43f98d99-0b4d-4a89-99ad-0291c7b4e8e9"&gt;way back in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and nearly sold out as I write these words.

&lt;p id="FQuee8"&gt;Each set is limited to 10,000 preorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chLMCs"&gt;A caution: BrickLink (which is owned by Lego as of 2019) only ships to 30 countries; it warns that the “final product may vary from image” for each of these sets; and they won’t include paper instruction manuals like the Lego sets you buy at retail. It’s also not clear what their boxes might look like — &lt;a href="https://www.bricklink.com/r3/designer-program/support/main.page"&gt;the company’s FAQ&lt;/a&gt; lists the countries it ships to, but doesn’t address whether they’ll have official Lego boxes at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MjvkUI"&gt;But they’re definitely fulfilled by Lego itself:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4ckz6JpNgkKNcH7zIeQNtd6ink=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002767/lego_proof.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Orders are fulfilled by Lego’s own storefront, as you can see from my preorder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QoYAJo"&gt;And all of these sets have reached 3,000 preorders and are considered “fully funded,” so they should be good to go. BrickLink estimates each of them should ship around the third quarter of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCYlPu"&gt;There’ll be a third round of voting for different sets later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5XJTV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:51PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that BrickLink will only ship these sets to 30 specific countries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s profit on ads, subscriptions, and data is double the money it makes selling TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJGP6DZ4xn65FZHlU9OznBD6950=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122952/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mf6LSd"&gt;It’s been less than a year since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22308068/vizio-ipo-filing-smartcast-inscape-tvs-soundbars-vzio"&gt;Vizio became a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt;, and one consequence of that is we know more about its business than ever before. The TV maker &lt;a href="https://investors.vizio.com/news/news-details/2021/VIZIO-HOLDING-CORP.-Reports-Q3-2021-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;released its latest earnings report on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; and revealed that over the last three months, its Platform Plus segment that includes advertising and viewer data had a gross profit of $57.3 million. That’s more than twice the amount of profit it made selling devices like TVs, which was $25.6 million, despite those device sales pulling in considerably more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z48v5t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most of Vizio’s profit came from advertising&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YFtA3l"&gt;When Vizio filed to go public, it described the difference between the two divisions. While Devices is easy to understand — 4K TVs, soundbars, etc. — Platform Plus is a little more complicated. It counts money made from selling ad placements on its TV homescreens, deals for the buttons on remotes, ads that run on streaming channels, its cut from subscriptions, and viewer data that it tracks and sells as part of the InScape program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yezcv1"&gt;The company says shipments of its TVs fell to 1.4 million in 2021 compared to 2.1 million in 2020, a drop of 36 percent. CEO William Wang told investors on the call that he sees “pretty healthy inventory” going into the holiday season, so anyone planning to pick up a value-priced TV or soundbar should have some decent options available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4X6sr"&gt;That spike in Platform Plus revenue, which shot up 136 percent compared to last year, did a lot to help Vizio make up the difference as profits from TVs dipped compared to last year. Supply chain and logistics problems affecting many companies hit Vizio hard, too, but execs also said the company is working with its third-party partners to help find warehouse and trucking employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L43ZHo"&gt;Where the numbers keep growing is in its number of active SmartCast accounts, which are now over 14 million, and how much money it makes from each user on average. That number has nearly doubled from last year, going from $10.44 to $19.89. On the call with investors and analysts, Vizio execs said 77 percent of that money comes directly from advertising, like the kind that runs on its WatchFree Plus package of streaming channels, a group that recently expanded with content targeting. The next biggest contributor is the money it makes selling Inscape data about what people are watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKVTRJ"&gt;Vizio isn’t the only smart TV maker that’s really in the advertising business — as we noted a couple of years ago, while you probably know Roku for its TV OS and streaming boxes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595384/roku-ceo-anthony-wood-ads-hardware-business-interview-business-model"&gt;CEO Anthony Wood is very up front about its true model&lt;/a&gt;. Roku’s most recent report revealed that on average it’s pulling in $40 per month on each user, or more than double what Vizio manages. One way Vizio plans to catch up is by building its own in-app payment system, which chief revenue officer Mike O’Donnell says will roll out to consumers next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KlRJDG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roku is in the ad business, not the hardware business, says CEO ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595384/roku-ceo-anthony-wood-ads-hardware-business-interview-business-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rddqMl"&gt;A few years ago, Vizio &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/6/14522582/vizio-ftc-lawsuit-tv-viewing-habits-tracking-privacy'"&gt;got in trouble with the FTC for not properly informing customers before they became a part of the tracking program&lt;/a&gt;. It disabled the system on older TVs, paid a couple of million bucks to settle the fine, and moved forward with its new SmartCast tech that focuses on streaming and makes sure new owners get a warning about what they’re opting into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AtBgf3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Most smart TVs are tracking you — Vizio just got caught ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14527360/vizio-smart-tv-tracking-settlement-disable-settings"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fMdubp"&gt;If you have a Vizio TV and all of this is news to you, then you may want to check out the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vizio.com%2Fen%2Fterms%2Fprivacy-policy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22773073%2Fvizio-acr-advertising-inscape-data-privacy-q3-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy page&lt;/a&gt; for more information. It also will tell you how to disable the Automated Content Recognition (ACR) and data collection tech embedded in its TVs, which is available here. If you prefer to opt out on a SmartCast TV, simply &lt;a href="https://support.vizio.com/s/article/Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-FAQ-How-to-turn-Smart-Interactivity-Broadcast-Interactivity-on-or-off?language=en_US"&gt;follow these instructions&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3elKF"&gt;Press the MENU button on your TV’s remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUKNft"&gt;Select System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVuQbj"&gt;Select Reset &amp;amp; Admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKt8wy"&gt;Highlight Viewing Data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6k5IJ"&gt;Press RIGHT arrow to change setting to Off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
