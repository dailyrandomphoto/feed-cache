    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air, one of the best laptops you can get, is now available at Amazon starting at $850.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgkMYN"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including ones equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult. It’s a slightly different story for the newer M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros, but any bit of savings you can get on the hit new Pro models is sure to be worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the discounts that are currently available for the latest MacBook models, as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — which are compatible with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;recently released macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; — but we strongly recommend opting for a newer model now that Apple has introduced its M1 chips across the MacBook Air and Pro lines. There is really no downside to opting for Apple’s own silicon, save for Windows Boot Camp holdouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac%2F2020-mac-mini-macbook-air-macbook-pro&amp;amp;subid1=vergemacbookdealsdecember2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. For now, however, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="15A2tS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;The best MacBook Air deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FJU3RG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance. It ticks all right boxes when it comes to performance and price, which is why it’s our number one pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best laptop of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iF2kto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It typically sells for $999; however, it’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9uVs7jC5c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $899.99. The $1,249 512GB configuration is also on sale in all colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9u0JFONVF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $1,099.99. These deals can come and go quickly, though, and if you’re gift shopping, you have to keep in mind a retailer’s cut-off date for arriving in time for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;The best MacBook Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xStRiT"&gt;The MacBook Pro line has been split into two different segments — for the time being. The M1-powered MacBook Pro of 2020 remains the final Touch Bar holdout. It is a sibling to the MacBook Air, introduced at the same time, with similar innards — save mostly for a fan that allows it to run at peak performance for longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2iOUM"&gt;The new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724306/apple-macbook-pro-event-biggest-announcements-airpods-m1-pro-max" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s “Unleashed” event&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, are all new and come with the M1 Pro or optional M1 Max CPUs. There are multiple variants of both models, though we haven’t seen any noteworthy discounts on any configuration outside of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s current discount of around $78 on the base 14-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. Though now that we’re in the heart of the holiday season, anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KS0G3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"2021 MacBook Pros compared: how Apple’s laptops stack up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733406/macbook-pro-13-14-16-inch-m1-max-air-compare-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="h4rH4i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviews&lt;/a&gt; of the latest MacBook Pro line were absolutely beaming with praise. Whether it was the beautiful display or the remarkable performance and battery life they exhibited, these premium laptops are investments that we can wholeheartedly recommend. As soon as there’s a price break on these impressive laptops, we’d suggest that anyone in the market for a new laptop consider purchasing one, as they’re likely to move fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDERSc"&gt;Right now, the only deal on the new crop of MacBook Pros is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQSLL92?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s price of $1,920.72 for the 14-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; with M1 Pro CPU. That’s a discount of $78.44 for the base model with M1 Pro processor, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oXGxIx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJENT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10814228"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The Touch Bar-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; is similar to the Air but geared toward slightly more demanding use cases. The M1-powered base model includes 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, a brighter screen, longer battery life, and an internal fan designed to maintain performance under increased workloads. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to $1,199. The larger, 512GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LM1K3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $1,249.99 at checkout, one of its best prices to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue6Q0U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;The best Mac Mini deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. The outright best deal on the base Mac Mini is at Amazon, where you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $569.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5P7TLW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $749.99 at checkout&lt;/a&gt;. Costco members can also purchase the &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%e2%80%93--silver.product.100694240.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB models for the same price&lt;/a&gt;, though no other retailers are offering this same discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="APBdOd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>After decades of surveillance, Muslims struggle with how much to share online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbyy3OCDQh2XmlmuhTM47t3-HxM=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70238973/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Islam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The long shadow of NYPD surveillance after 9/11&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="sefJQI"&gt;Thirteen years ago, Mosaab Sadeia accompanied his father to a mosque in Staten Island. He remembers it was during the winter, after the last Isha prayer when his father went to meet with the sheikh. Mosaab remembers grabbing a book from the bookshelf and sitting down down to read it. Then, a man he had never seen before in his close-knit community came up to him and asked him, “What do you think of Hamas?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUe0mA"&gt;Sadeia was stunned. He was just nine years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icx4Iu"&gt;The man was suspected of being an informant, although it was never confirmed. (Many never are.) And though it was Mosaab’s first encounter with surveillance, it wouldn’t be his last. It’s a common story among Muslims in New York — and in an age of oversharing, that experience has had a strange impact. Many, like Sadeia, have grown up cautious of saying too much online, wary of others like the man he met that day. A younger generation of Muslims has taken a more vocal approach, eager to break out of the fear of surveillance. But for both, the experience of social media is inseparable from the feeling of being watched — and the experience of being Muslim in New York City after 9/11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="SsjLZ5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NYPD “subjected entire neighborhoods to surveillance and scrutiny, often because of the ethnicity of the residents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="448cyZ"&gt;Since 2002, the NYPD has religiously profiled and surveilled Muslims in New York City and neighboring states &lt;a href="https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/radicalization-west-homegrown-threat"&gt;in an attempt to find “radicalization.”&lt;/a&gt; The NYPD Intelligence Division has mapped Muslim communities, conducted photo and video surveillance, recruited informants, tracked those who changed their names, and generated intelligence databases, &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/other/factsheet-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program"&gt;according to the ACLU&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/about/awards-and-recognition/highlights-of-aps-pulitzer-prize-winning-probe-into-nypd-intelligence-operations"&gt;the Associated Press exposed the extent of the NYPD’s surveillance&lt;/a&gt;, determining that the NYPD “subjected entire neighborhoods to surveillance and scrutiny, often because of the ethnicity of the residents, not because of any accusations of crimes.” &lt;a href="https://www.ap.org/ap-in-the-news/2012/nypd-muslim-spying-led-to-no-leads-terror-cases"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the NYPD acknowledged in testimony that the Demographics Unit — its name for the internal group that carried out the surveillance — never generated a lead or triggered a terrorism investigation in its years of operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLYiLt"&gt;In 2014, the Demographics Unit was discontinued, but it still casts a long shadow over the city’s Muslim communities. Sadeia is now outreach director at Majlis Ash-Shura: Islamic Leadership Council of New York, and remembers countless other incidents where he felt he was being surveilled. He has had random people ask him what his opinions on the caliphate are; what he thinks about Israel. Some of the people who asked him such questions were later confirmed by the mosques to be informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeWnI7"&gt;“It’s just someone who you have no idea who they are. You’ve never seen them and no one knows them and they come inside the masjid and start asking really weird questions. And you’re just sitting there not really sure how to react,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “A normal person in the time we live in doesn’t ask questions like that.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w3FEd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t share many details of my personal life online. That’s just my way of protection.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ph5WFg"&gt;Even though he attended an Islamic school, Sadeia says he was always cautious of what he said in class. In college, he learned to “speak smart.” Even after graduating, he is not as active on social media as other people his age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga6ZNr"&gt;“Even after I made a social media account, there was always the rule of ‘You don’t talk about politics on social media, you don’t talk about what happens in other countries on social media.’ Partly because of the US government and its history of entrapping people and lying about it,” he said. “I don’t share many details of my personal life online. That’s just my way of protection. Not that it isn’t out there and can’t be found, but why should I make it easier for someone who is tracking me?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKAu9C"&gt;Ainikki Riikonen, a researcher with the technology and national security program with the Center for a New American Security, says the conversation around Muslim surveillance is shifting, but only slowly. “Counterterrorism is a profession, it’s an expertise. People spend their lives getting Ph.D.’s and getting really specific knowledge on very specific groups and ways of network analysis,” Riikonen says. “Twenty years on, there’s no excuse to be doing this blanket surveillance and targeting people on the basis of religion. There’s absolutely no excuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kTfxOK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why do we even bother pretending that we’re not fully Muslim? Why do we even bother not being our authentic selves?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NdwYy"&gt;Twenty-four-year-old Haris Khan, a community organizer and a board member at the Muslim Democratic Club of New York (MDCNY), is much more active on social media than Sadeia. When Khan was a student at the City College of New York, he heard from many of his classmates about their experiences and how afraid they were. During his own time in college, he found himself shying away from his faith publicly in an effort to not be so different, to try to fit in, to assimilate. Eventually he realized there was no point in staying silent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9oAMEQ"&gt;“Trying to fit in or being quiet about issues … Even if you do all of that, you still get called a terrorist,” Khan said. “So why do we even bother pretending that we’re not fully Muslim? Why do we even bother not being our authentic selves? They’re going to weaponize our identity either way. We might as well use it to organize and mobilize and speak our truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFPvCy"&gt;Khan works in the political field, and even that doesn’t stop him from showcasing his opinions publicly online. &lt;a href="https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israeli-settlers-broke-al-aqsa-compound-despite-muslim-holy-event-prior-eid-al-adha"&gt;After the historic Al-Aqsa Mosque was raided&lt;/a&gt; in Jerusalem during Ramadan this year, Khan put up a tweet about how he was feeling. Soon enough, he had people tweeting back telling him he should be fired from his government job because, as he saw it, “I have a political opinion about ending the apartheid.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zn3x4"&gt;Still, he sees Twitter blowback as a small price to pay for having a space to share his views openly. “I am not afraid of being surveilled for my viewpoints, for my desire to see a just world,” Khan said. “They can copy and paste my tweets and my posts. It is what it is, that is who I am. That is what my family has taught me. That is what the community I belong to values.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NI3P5"&gt;In 2012, Asad Dandia, the community programs coordinator at the Council on American-Islamic Relations New York (CAIR-NY), found out he had been surveilled for seven months by a person he had befriended. The informant traveled with him and his friends to events, lectures, and would even assist them in delivering food to homeless people every night. So when Dandia found out that his friend was an informant all along, the betrayal was palpable. He remembers anxiety attacks and a constant paranoia. The next year, he joined &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/raza-v-city-new-york-legal-challenge-nypd-muslim-surveillance-program"&gt;a class action lawsuit against the NYPD&lt;/a&gt; over surveillance of Muslims, resulting in new protections against the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEjc0u"&gt;Ultimately, the experience made Dandia value his ties to the community even more. “We have to keep each other safe.” he said. “One of the intended effects of surveillance is to stifle your speech, to stifle your community activity, and essentially they want you to not be active. I always say do the reverse. Be as active and involved as possible, get in touch with organizations that can help you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2EhL1"&gt;“And do not cower,” he continued. “Because they want you to cower.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Gmail app now lets you make voice and video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3uDNm9rcdjjj44kGzqOQPBRANE=/0x0:1629x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70238699/gmail_calls.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calls can be initiated from the top right of a chat.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjCNEs"&gt;One-on-one voice and video calls are now rolling out for Google Chat inside the Gmail app on iOS and Android, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/start-meetings-or-audio-calls-from-one-on-one-google-chat-messages.html"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The feature was first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661348/gmail-ring-meet-communication-suite-series-one-monitor-workspace"&gt;announced in September&lt;/a&gt;, but as of December 6th it’s started rolling out for anyone with Google Workspace, G Suite, or personal Google accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgGGCS"&gt;It’s previously been possible to start calls from within the Gmail app, but until now it’s involved sending an invite to a Google Meet video conferencing call, which feels excessive for a one-on-one conversation. Going forward, however, there’ll be simple phone and video icons in the top right of every one-on-one chat which can be used for calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zt52bj"&gt;It’s a simple addition, but it’s one that furthers Google’s goal of making Gmail the central hub for all its communication services. In fact, Google’s post says you’ll be redirected to the Gmail app, even if you start a call from within the Google Chat app. As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661348/gmail-ring-meet-communication-suite-series-one-monitor-workspace"&gt;Dieter Bohn pointed out in September&lt;/a&gt;, emails now take up just one of the four tabs in the current Gmail app, alongside Chat, Spaces (Google’s Slack-style messaging service), and Meet (its video conferencing service).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram to introduce parental control features next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RuXff5kKmWycpNZR_H9vmoVdydI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70238619/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6vfLBq"&gt;Instagram will roll out new parental control features on its platform in March, the service’s head Adam Mosseri has announced &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/raising-the-standard-for-protecting-teens-and-supporting-parents-online"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. They’ll allow parents and guardians to see how much time their teenagers spend on Instagram, set time limits, and get notified if their child reports someone. The controls were announced as a package of new features designed to make the platform a safer place, particularly for its teenage users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ng95I"&gt;Although Mosseri’s post says these safety features have been in the works for “a long time,” their announcement comes in the wake of a series of damaging revelations about the Meta-owned social network. Most notably, internal documents leaked by whistleblower Frances Haugen showed Instagram was aware that its service can make body image issues worse for its female teenage users. This week, Mosseri is due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800901/instagram-chief-adam-mosseri-testify-congress-facebook-meta-zuckerberg"&gt;testify in front of a Senate committee&lt;/a&gt;, where he will likely be asked about the impact of Instagram on its young users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMvUxu"&gt;Alongside the new parental controls, Instagram says it’s developing an educational hub for parents and guardians to offer them tips and tutorials about children’s social media use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PTTubM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nudges, stricter recommendation settings, and tagging permissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eRteMC"&gt;In the more immediate future, Instagram says it’s rolling out the “Take a Break” feature it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;started testing last month&lt;/a&gt;. This opt-in feature prompts users to step away from the app once they’ve been scrolling for a certain amount of time, like 10, 20, or 30 minutes. Notifications will prompt users to turn the feature on, and Instagram says 90 percent of users in tests have left the reminders on once they’ve been set. The feature is launching in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia today, and will be available globally early next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Le6h3M"&gt;Other new safety features include changes to how Instagram handles tagging permissions for teenage users, which are due to roll out to everyone early next year. By default, Mosseri says the service will no longer allow users to tag or mention teenage users. There’s also a new bulk delete feature coming in January, which will let users remove their posts, likes, and comments en masse. Mosseri says this is designed to help users “manage their digital footprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="os1cvE"&gt;Mosseri’s post also goes into details about safety features that are in their earlier development stages. It confirms the service is continuing to explore plans to “nudge” people away from topics they’ve been dwelling on for too long. When he announced this feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;alongside Take a Break in October&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said it would kick in for “content which may not be conducive to [a user’s] well being.” Instagram hasn’t provided an indication for when the feature may launch. The service is also exploring introducing a stricter setting to control what content gets recommended to users in Explore, aimed at limiting their exposure to “potential harmful or sensitive content or accounts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD4e0g"&gt;Although Instagram’s post contains a number of quotes from experts and research partners writing in support of the new features, Mosseri will have his work cut out if he wants to win over increasingly critical lawmakers in the US. “Meta is attempting to shift attention from their mistakes by rolling out parental guides, use timers and content control features that consumers should have had all along,” Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/technology/instagram-parental-controls.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “But my colleagues and I see right through what they are doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfTJTN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzLNWu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung combines mobile and consumer electronics businesses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/po1AsPv2X8b0imuH2Lh5lGDMw4I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237930/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgoLKm"&gt;Samsung Electronics has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-new-leadership-2"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an internal reorganization of its businesses with several changes to leadership. The company will have two new CEOs overseeing two divisions: Device Solutions, which is the semiconductors business, and a new SET Division that includes mobile, TVs, and consumer electronics. It’s the biggest change to Samsung’s structure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16580050/samsung-electronics-new-ceos-announcement-q3-2017-earnings"&gt;since 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when the company appointed three leaders for three separate divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DM8xIa"&gt;Jong-hee (JH) Han, the head of the Visual Display business, is also now a co-CEO with responsibility for the SET division. Samsung credits him with having led the company to the top position in TV sales worldwide for 15 years running and says he is “expected to strengthen the synergies among the different businesses in the SET Division and help drive new businesses and technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQSUTo"&gt;The other new CEO is Kyehyun Kyung, previously CEO of Samsung Electro-Mechanics. He’s also worked on Samsung’s flash memory product team and the DRAM design team in the past, and will now be tasked with leading Samsung’s all-important, highly profitable semiconductors division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWyPfG"&gt;Samsung has also named heads of North American offices for both the SET and DS divisions, as well as a new CFO, Hark Kyu Park. The management shakeup effectively streamlines the sprawling tech giant’s organizational structure into two businesses for consumer products and components respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite won’t let you pick levels to replay — but that’s going to change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7sS1Xqc1s8hK-SHi7OuO85NM11w=/1x0:1455x969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237828/ss_139cc855c27fe902e58ba8e7af0aad1aee6ac876.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief and The Weapon in &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhdtbM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign launches on Wednesday, but after your first trip through the story, you won’t be able to replay missions without starting all the way over, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22820921/halo-infinite-story-mission-replayability"&gt;Microsoft confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a significant omission, since it means you won’t be able to get collectibles you miss the first time around. It also means &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is the first &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game without a way to go back and easily replay a chapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UTmARu"&gt;That might not always be the case, though, as developer 343 Industries wants to add the feature down the line, the studio told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We haven’t announced a date but that is being worked on,” 343 Industries associate creative director Paul Crocker said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIxOlS"&gt;“We want to have replay that works well, and when you have a more open game, it gets a lot trickier,” he said. “So we made a decision to improve the quality of the single-player campaign to ensure that, as a foundation, that it’s as strong as it possibly could be so that we could then add the other features back in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYTsGZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some elements do carry over between full campaign replays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XB8Wtz"&gt;It’s frustrating not to be able to play through missions again; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; has some impressive set pieces and great boss fights that I’d love to tackle without going through the entire story another time. However, there are some elements that &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; carry over between full campaign replays, according to Crocker, including data pads (which contain story-focused voice logs) and the hard-to-find skulls that, in past games, let you modify certain aspects of the experience (such as doubling enemy health). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rf7wuZ"&gt;Replayable story missions aren’t the only thing that was pushed back for the launch; you’re going to have to wait &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;at least six months&lt;/a&gt; for the time-honored tradition of playing through the campaign cooperatively with a friend, something you’ve been able to do since the very first &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game. The goal was “from day one” to make the game playable in co-op and allow people to replay missions, but “we just had to prioritize what we could get done in time,” Crocker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXiwuD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; has had a somewhat rocky development. It was originally set to release alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November 2020, but was delayed to 2021 after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335520/halo-infinite-gameplay-xbox-series-x-trailer-demo"&gt;gameplay reveal&lt;/a&gt; that birthed the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/craig-from-halo-infinite-is-the-new-xbox-mascot-jokes-xbox-chief"&gt;Craig meme&lt;/a&gt;. Forge mode, which was introduced in &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt; and lets players develop multiplayer maps and games, is also missing for &lt;em&gt;Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; launch. And while 343 Industries launched &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782786/halo-infinite-multiplayer-available-download-launch"&gt;free-to-play multiplayer beta early&lt;/a&gt;, it has had to address criticisms of the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788990/halo-infinite-battle-pass-progression-xp-changes"&gt;progression system&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;lack of dedicated playlists&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBLlyw"&gt;Despite those problems, the extra development time paid off for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; campaign and multiplayer, which are both pretty good. That bodes well for the features that won’t make it at launch — even if we don’t know how long we’ll have to wait for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s media company has a new CEO: soon-to-be-former-Rep. Devin Nunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Republican Conference at Capitol Hill Club" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Chf4WF3nwwK3IRviti9ape-bQgU=/0x0:6525x4350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237802/1237059264.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., leaves a meeting of the House Republican Conference at the Capitol Hill Club on Wednesday, December 1, 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l7o5tn"&gt;A filing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820389/sec-trump-spac-deal-investigation-truth-social-media-platform-public"&gt;just revealed an SEC investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the plans for a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) named Digital World Acquisition Corp. to merge with Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and start trading on the Nasdaq, so what’s next for the would-be social media/regular media giant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pg3Wiw"&gt;Naturally, TMTG has &lt;a href="https://ir.tmtgcorp.com/news-events/press-releases/"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; a splashy new hire as its CEO, recruiting Congressman Devin G. Nunes. A supporter, and defender of Trump, Nunes served on the House Intelligence Committee as it investigated allegations Russia helped the Trump campaign during the 2016 election. Yes, that’s also “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/18/18271805/devin-nunes-twitter-lawsuit-250-million-liz-mair-defamation'"&gt;I sued Twitter for letting Devin Nunes’ Mom and Devin Nunes’ Cow insult me&lt;/a&gt;” Devin G. Nunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVAG7q"&gt;The congressman plans to leave the US House of Representatives — where redistricting &lt;a href="https://www.sfgate.com/national-politics/article/Devin-Nunes-redistricting-Fresno-Tulare-2022-map-16613177.php"&gt;may have made his current seat tough to hold on to&lt;/a&gt; — and take on the new role in January. In a statement, the man named in a lawsuit claiming &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/devincow"&gt;this cow account&lt;/a&gt; caused him “extreme pain and suffering” says, “The time has come to reopen the Internet and allow for the free flow of ideas and expression without censorship.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YSaGD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Truth Social recently admitted it uses open source technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zHtDsu"&gt;As CEO of TMTG, he would be in charge of the upcoming social media platform Truth Social, hoping to go toe-to-toe with the likes of Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22807651/jack-dorsey-steps-down-twitter-ceo-parag-agrawal-replacement"&gt;Parag Agrawal&lt;/a&gt; of Twitter (both platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218805/donald-trump-platforms-bans-facebook-twitter-youtube"&gt;banned the former president&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol). Nunes will also run streaming platform TMTG Plus, which the company says is a subscription-based video service full of “non-woke entertainment, news, documentaries, podcasts and more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVWrqm"&gt;According to TMTG chairman Donald Trump, “Congressman Devin Nunes is a fighter and a leader. He will make an excellent CEO of TMTG. Devin understands that we must stop the liberal media and Big Tech from destroying the freedoms that make America great. America is ready for TRUTH Social and the end to censorship and political discrimination.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SSlpy"&gt;In October, Truth Social was cited by Mastodon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752850/mastodon-trump-truth-social-network-open-source-gab-legal-notice"&gt;for reusing the project’s open source code without including the required notifications&lt;/a&gt; and publishing whatever tweaks it made so that the community could benefit. Since then, &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/trumps-social-media-site-quietly-admits-its-based-on-mastodon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that Truth Social has &lt;a href="https://truthsocial.com/open-source/"&gt;acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; its open-source roots and posted some code. However, the package available doesn’t appear to include any of the “proprietary” code operators said the site will use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyU7El"&gt;While announcing the merger between DWAC and TMTG, the companies indicated Truth Social would have a “Beta Launch for invited guests” in November.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the US should ‘get rid of all’ government subsidies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Gigafactory - Elon Musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/il0mX3UUytsVhTMaP8XI_n2tP4c=/0x254:3926x2871/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237784/1234657391.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wACrKi"&gt;Elon Musk said Monday &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSD_vpfikbE"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; CEO summit&lt;/a&gt; that he doesn’t think the United States needs the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill — or any government subsidies, for that matter. “Just delete them all,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgEys2"&gt;The Tesla and SpaceX CEO said during the interview that he’s concerned about the federal deficit. “We’ve spent so much money.. the federal budget deficit is insane,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euYUQ1"&gt;“I would say... can the whole bill. Don’t pass it, that’s my recommendation,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHpeAG"&gt;Musk pointed out that Tesla has been selling its electric cars for more than a year in the US without the $7,500 federal tax credit, without taking a demand hit. Most other automakers, save for General Motors, are still eligible for the credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu9GAl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lSD_vpfikbE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WH5Afm"&gt;The Build Back Better portion of Biden’s infrastructure plan currently includes a provision to extend that credit and add another subsidy for electric vehicles made by union workforces, though it still needs to make it through the senate. Musk has derided the union-focused credit in recent months and &lt;a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/elon-musk-feud-biden-administration-51635729047?tesla=y"&gt;called Biden a “puppet” of the United Auto Workers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFMLMq"&gt;Musk also said he doesn’t believe the US government should be giving out subsidies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22765438/biden-infrastructure-bill-electric-vehicle-ev-charging-level-2"&gt;expand charging infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; — though that provision is in the infrastructure bill that Biden already signed into law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHwEEc"&gt;“Do we need support for gas stations? We don’t. So there’s no need for this,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSMSBk"&gt;Tesla currently operates more than 3,000 charging stations with around 30,000 connectors worldwide, but plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22596337/tesla-supercharger-elon-musk-open-network-charging-stations"&gt;open that network to other electric vehicles sometime in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TiW3WN"&gt;Musk’s companies have benefitted from many different federal and state subsidies over the years, and the government is a major SpaceX customer (though SpaceX won much of that business by dramatically undercutting the prices of established players). Tesla has also found tremendous success in China after receiving lots of help from the central government there. Musk said Monday that Tesla “did not anticipate any subsidies” when the company was in its early years.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we’ve compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the latest Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;While the AirPods Pro carry a lofty, $249.99 price tag, they also go on sale rather frequently. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw them drop to as low as $170. They’re no longer available at that low of a price, but you can still get a pair with the MagSafe charging case for $189.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9zDqO"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7OEaEgK25" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter retailer also has the last-gen configuration with the Qi-compatible wireless charging case for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wsgbtVkT" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt; ($50 off), and is throwing in six months of Apple Music and Apple News Plus, if you’re a new subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ps2LHc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868644"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — now the entry-level model — with either a wired or wireless charging case. The base AirPods normally retail for $129, but currently, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods with a Qi-compatible wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. We saw them drop to $99 at Walmart during the most recent shopping holiday, but at the moment, you can only get them for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf7OJt7pgP9" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy and at Target for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1216671/2092?subId1=VergeBestWirelessEarbudsDeals12621&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the Galaxy Buds Pro were more than $50 off, bringing the price down to around $150 — nearly an all-time low — in select colorways. They are still on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWifJWOA7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, however, but only for $159.99 ($40 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design — back in August, and we’re already starting to see some discounts at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get them at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQroWm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall, but have since been discontinued with the arrival of the Galaxy Buds 2. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the $149.99 Galaxy Buds Plus in black for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months and likely one of the last major discounts we’ll see before the earbuds become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MjZMZR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. Right now, you can purchase a pair of the $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live in select colorways for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08J3Y4W5J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, an $80 discount, or for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wI2v49bF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, and improve on their excellent predecessor in several ways. Sony’s latest earbuds include better battery life and noise cancellation, as well as superior sound quality and IPX4 water resistance. Normally $279.99, they’re currently receiving a small discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743035238017039291" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to around $248. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lZIzyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UMsK59"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;The predecessor to the WF-1000XM4, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, remain a terrific pair of earbuds that routinely go on sale. Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for around $128 ($72 off), their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0sP2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. You can currently buy the $229.99 Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$149.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfB2WVItB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, their best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L8bJWl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option for wireless earbuds that have multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. The Jabra 75t are currently selling for $79.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfDfEmv2ecW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, nearly their lowest price to date, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt; are the latest fitness earbuds from Apple, and offer a sportier design and better sound than the AirPods Pro, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, these shiny new earbuds are currently only available for their full price of $199.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVt5tpQYGc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL65GNM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="OvwTzC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ3wLT"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07W5JZBVJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/2rKXO0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earphones in a handful of colorways for $149.95 and $179.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L75Qn4"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are also excellent noise-canceling wireless earbuds that are currently on sale. As we noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, the earbuds offer great ANC performance, customizable controls, and sound that can nearly match that of a premium pair of noise-canceling over-ear headphones. Normally $299.95, you can buy them at Amazon for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085LW8N9Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169.99&lt;/a&gt; in white — their best price ever — or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-Momentum-True-Wireless-Cancellation/dp/B085LVV8R7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$188.95&lt;/a&gt; in black. Note that the discount for the white earbuds will not show up until checkout. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230931/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review-earbuds-headphones-sound-specs-battery-life-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VIqEJG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882846"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5v8fu"&gt;After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds. They thus make great a choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, we found they also offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy eight-hour battery life. Normally $249.99, you can get them right now for just &lt;a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits%3Firclickid%3DwiuzeN2aXxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkG2ya3h1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Dradius%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26irgwc%3D1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; in various colors from Ultimate Ears. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read the review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;Like their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen predecessor&lt;/a&gt;, the 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great value. Amazon’s latest true wireless earbuds offer improved comfort and better noise cancellation, along with a terrific passthrough mode that ensures you can always hear what’s going on around you. The $119.99 earbuds also feature hands-free Alexa support and sound that’s remarkably satisfying, with more bass than the AirPods Pro and an appropriate amount of restraint when it comes to the high end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb3iGA"&gt;The second-gen Amazon Echo Buds are often discounted at most retailers. Currently, you can get the latest $119.99 Echo Buds with the wired charging case at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WV7635?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYSsVV4J8B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $69.99.

    <title>I regret to inform you that Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS) is now an acronym </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XUqdfynHeOCJqNEf8YQ8A6hUA8=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70237636/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSi2lL"&gt;Science fiction movies have prepared us for the distinct possibility that artificial intelligence will walk among us someday. How soon? No one can say — but that isn’t stopping a raft of companies by trying to sell “digital humans” before that whole &lt;em&gt;intelligence &lt;/em&gt;thing gets figured out. Ah, but what if you don’t want to &lt;em&gt;buy&lt;/em&gt; a digital human because that sounds icky? Rent one, of course! That’s why we now have the regrettable acronym Digital Human as a Service (DHaaS). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFaazl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211203005441/en/KDDI-and-Mawari-to-Launch-a-Digital-Human-as-a-Service-DHaaS-Using-AWS-Wavelength/"&gt;The actual news here&lt;/a&gt; is that Japanese telecom giant KDDI has partnered with a firm named Mawari (which means something along the lines of “surroundings” in Japanese) to create a virtual assistant you can “see” through the window of your smartphone in augmented reality, one who might automatically pop up to give you directions and interact if you point your phone at a real-world location. (You’ll also see walking directions and indoor maps in the video, but those simply appear to be packaged together as part of the proof of concept.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Map68D"&gt;If you peek the video atop this post, you can see it’s not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; much more advanced than, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761166/pokemon-go-ar-games-future-pikmin-harry-potter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But behind the scenes, the partners claim that KDDI’s 5G network, Amazon’s low-latency AWS Wavelength edge computing nodes, and a proprietary codec from Mawari combine to let “digital humans” stream to your phone in real time instead of running natively on your phone’s chip. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1d0_0rnC5gkPkp97ggcHl_XsXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23068620/aiko_digital_human_as_a_service.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zsrMiR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaOtMZ"&gt;That “substantially lower[s] the heavy processing requirements of real-time digital humans, reducing cost, data size and battery consumption while unlocking scalability,” according to the press release. (It’s true that AR apps like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; tend to chow down on battery, but it’s not just graphics to blame; some of that is running GPS, camera and cellular simultaneously.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvvEtZ"&gt;Who’s going to jump on board to actually populate the metaverse with experiences designed for KDDI and Mawari’s “digital humans” and pay monthly, quarterly or annually for the “service” part of the acronym? That’s always the question, but there’s no shortage of companies looking to lean into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the buzzy metaverse&lt;/a&gt; these days. And if they can leverage their existing buzzwords like “5G”, “AI” and “Edge compute,” so much the better. It takes a lot of work to look like you’re paying attention to the future, and you never know if this  is the moment someone actually manages to &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/stop-trying-to-make-fetch-happen"&gt;make fetch happen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvkmDS"&gt;Want some more digital humans? We’ve got you covered:&lt;/p&gt;
