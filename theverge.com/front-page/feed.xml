    <title>After weeks of hate raids, Twitch streamers are taking a day off in protest</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;As streamers prepare to walk off Twitch, hate raids and abuse are escalating to dangerous levels&lt;em&gt;  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dNf65c"&gt;On Wednesday, September 1st, a number of channels on Twitch will go dark as streamers participate in #ADayOffTwitch, a walkout designed to bring attention to the ongoing hate and harassment that’s plagued the platform for the last several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsW9zA"&gt;Created by Twitch streamers &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/shineypen"&gt;ShineyPen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LuciaEverblack"&gt;Lucia Everblack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;RekitRaven&lt;/a&gt;, the walkout aims to bring greater awareness to the problems creators are suffering on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with these organizers, streamers, and others to talk about #ADayOffTwitch, how they’re coping with the precipitous rise of hate raids, and what they hope the platform will do to protect its users in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSuevR"&gt;A Day Off Twitch was born out of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitchdobetter&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt; movement, a hashtag created by streamers affected by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;hate raids that have exploded across Twitch&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks. Though the action of bombing a streamer’s chat with racist, sexist, transphobic, and generally abusive messages is not new, the phenomenon has seen a dramatic increase, thanks to users employing bots to overwhelm chats with hundreds of automatically generated messages. In response to what they thought was Twitch’s slow response to the abuse, streamer RekitRaven created the #TwitchDoBetter hashtag to urge the Amazon-owned streaming platform to deploy better tools to stem the tide of harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Z4y4R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The one day off is a step in the many steps we have to take towards change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jnxi7c"&gt;Twitch has promised that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1428813772391522307?s=20"&gt;fixes are forthcoming&lt;/a&gt;, but in the meantime, streamers are left to contend against the hate raids with community-developed tools and resources. ShineyPen, a Black, trans streamer, thought more should be done in addition to talking about the problem, so he decided to organize a walkout. “A Day Off [Twitch] is largely about coming together in solidarity. The one day off is a step in the many steps we have to take towards change,” Shiney tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Szw3lP"&gt;RekitRaven echoed Shiney’s statements that this walkout is more about solidarity among marginalized streamers than a means to impact Twitch’s bottom line. “I think it’s important to band together for the good of everyone who’s been affected and to show that we’re not gonna back down,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsmGBg"&gt;The responses to A Day Off Twitch have been varied, even among its supporters. Because of Twitch’s endemic hold on the streaming community, it’s just not feasible for some smaller streamers, arguably the population most affected by hate raids, to take a day off. For some creators, Twitch is their only means of income. Users trying to make or maintain affiliate or partner status — designations that grant creators access to many different methods of monetization — could jeopardize their finances or the health of their channel by taking even one day off. There are also contractual obligations like advertising deals or partnerships that prevent streamers from skipping a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LVxImW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A note about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADayOffTwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt; from the cast &amp;amp; crew of our streamed show. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please read &amp;amp; remember not everyone is free to take tomorrow off, no matter the level of support they have for the event. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Pu6lE8CucQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Pu6lE8CucQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mother LandsRPG: Season 3!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFc6Fq"&gt;Other streamers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xdetune/status/1429841772797210628?s=20"&gt;oppose A Day Off Twitch&lt;/a&gt; for more philosophical reasons. To them, the people behind these hate raids are working to bully marginalized streamers off the platform, and taking a day off is giving them exactly what they want. Continuing to stream and speaking out against the abuse is therefore the best way to counter trolls who might not otherwise face repercussions for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1F7qR"&gt;As September 1st nears and A Day Off Twitch gains traction, there’s a noticeable silence from some of Twitch’s biggest stars. And some of the larger streamers who are talking about it don’t have nice things to say. Asmongold, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20861066/world-of-warcraft-wow-classic-twitch-fortnite-ninja-streamers-change"&gt;a longtime &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft &lt;/em&gt;streamer&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/wow-disappointment-plus-twitch-start-mass-exodus-into-1847283978"&gt;made headlines when he switched to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/ShinyStrongSkunkGOWSkull-5Md7teUvy22IRBHt"&gt;said in a stream&lt;/a&gt;, “Nobody gives a fuck if you take the day off. Nobody knows who you are.” He goes on to say he would participate in a Twitch walkout if every other big streamer got involved and that he believes “in the power of numbers.” Asmongold has 2.4 million followers on Twitch and did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jULNEz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not worried about that. We’re already making an impact. The world is watching.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tatpu4"&gt;There’s a wider feeling of abandonment and hypocrisy concerning larger streamers’ silence on the matter of hate raids. During pride month or protests for racial equality, streamers large and small voiced their support for the communities affected. Yet some of those same voices aren’t being heard now. “I accept that not everyone will be on board with supporting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ADayOffTwitch?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#ADayOffTwitch&lt;/a&gt;,” ShineyPen says. “I believe that many, not all, of these bigger creators are speaking from a privileged perspective.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fh3s7l"&gt;“Being vocal has the potential to hurt them financially,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vicious696"&gt;Parris Lilly&lt;/a&gt;, Twitch streamer and host for Xbox’s 2021 Gamescom presentation, adds. “Nobody cares how POCs are treated as long as it doesn’t affect them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzMTQU"&gt;RekitRaven was less concerned about larger streamers’ seeming unwillingness to participate in or even acknowledge the Twitch walkout. “All I can say is I’m not worried about that. We’re already making an impact. The world is watching.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntLeeu"&gt;Twitch is also watching. A spokesperson for Twitch told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We support our streamers’ rights to express themselves and bring attention to important issues across our service. No one should have to experience malicious and hateful attacks based on who they are or what they stand for, and we are working hard on improved channel-level ban evasion detection and additional account improvements to help &lt;a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/Combating-Targeted-Attacks?language=en_US"&gt;make Twitch a safer place for creators&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BeQVg"&gt;Twitch’s support for A Day Off Twitch extends even beyond its statements. The platform is kicking off its &lt;a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/08/26/this-subtember-is-going-to-be-magic/"&gt;Subtember event&lt;/a&gt; on September 2nd, a day after the protests, presumably so streamers who may participate can still take advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iON6Ts"&gt;As Twitch works on developing those safety improvements and streamers still contend with the dangerous hate raids that are leading to doxxing and swatting, the conversation of moving to other platforms has yet again cropped up. Twitch is the biggest fish in the streaming pond, but it is not the only one. Even after Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;shut down its Mixer platform&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook and YouTube offer alternatives to streamers fed up with what they feel is Twitch’s slow and reactive response to harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="89o51a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Creators on Facebook Gaming can disable raids altogether, or select individual creator pages to ‘block’ incoming raids from.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZzPOd"&gt;DrLupo, once one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;he signed an exclusive deal with YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, making the platform an attractive alternative to Twitch and, most importantly, one that can be financially viable. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;asked YouTube Gaming what protections it had in place for streamers, but it did not respond in time for publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqC4hx"&gt;While it does not have the reach of Twitch or YouTube, Facebook Gaming is also slowly growing its streaming presence especially among Black creators — a frequent target of hate raids. Facebook Gaming’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22158677/facebook-gaming-black-gaming-creator-program"&gt;Black Creators Program&lt;/a&gt; guarantees monthly pay, early product access, and offers mentorship programs to participating Black streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UljqEE"&gt;Luis Olivalves, Facebook Gaming’s global gaming creator partnerships director, also shared the platform’s policies for streamer protections:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SzH0Al"&gt;The majority of creators come to Facebook Gaming to build positive and supportive communities around the games they love. To do this, it’s important for creators and their moderators to have tools and resources at their disposal to foster the safe and inclusive environments they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvo58M"&gt;We also hear from our creators and gaming communities that the use of real names on our platform, which reduces anonymity, contributes to a generally more positive environment on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQQB7B"&gt;While we find that raids are most commonly used in a positive and supportive way on our platform, it’s important our creators have control over who can and can’t raid their channels. Creators on Facebook Gaming can disable raids altogether, or select individual creator pages to ‘block’ incoming raids from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bkCrS1"&gt;Disabling raids and the ability to screen raids before they could cause harm is one of the biggest asks from the Twitch community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajXJR1"&gt;And if moving off Twitch simply isn’t a feasible solution, there are now ways to continue to use the platform while depriving Twitch of its cut of streamers’ profits. Streamlabs, a popular streaming tools service, recently announced it’s &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers"&gt;adding a tipping function&lt;/a&gt; that allows viewers to set up recurring donations. Currently, only streamers who meet certain criteria are allowed to collect subscription money of which Twitch takes 50 percent. This Streamlabs option makes it possible for anyone to receive recurring donations, 100 percent of which goes directly to the streamer after processing fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNjDV"&gt;The organizers of A Day Off Twitch don’t necessarily want to jump ship yet. “I don’t have plans to find a new platform,” ShineyPen says. “However [...] I do believe that having an alternative is good to have in our back pockets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haYwAy"&gt;The connection to Twitch is strong. It’s the place where these streamers have built friendships, communities, and business opportunities, and they don’t want to lose that place because of the maliciousness of racist, transphobic trolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUSWVe"&gt;“There are so many marginalized individuals out there who are seeking a  place to feel safe, to feel like they belong and to have representation and that’s what we’re doing,” ShineyPen says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BySDE7"&gt;“We owe it to ourselves and our communities to at least try to improve conditions and make it a better place,” said Lucia Everblack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3i4LfT"&gt;According to Everblack, A Day Off Twitch is already successful, even before it’s begun. “The whole goal was to generate broader discussion.” But more than awareness, Everblack and the walkout’s organizers and participants just want their communities to feel safe and be protected. “We don’t just want solutions to current problems,” Everblack says. “We want policies in place so that these kinds of problems never happen again or at least never get this severe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uuuvbs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zzjovu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes its mandatory return to office date into 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GG9hTcCzmL9tD7ptIhSJicnA0lA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799313/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvxQEG"&gt;In an email to employees today, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/extending-our-voluntary-return-office/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;Google CEO Sundar Pichai said&lt;/a&gt; that even though “we are welcoming back tens of thousands of Googlers on a voluntary basis,” the company will extend its voluntary return to work policy until at least January 10th, 2022. After that date, the current plan is to have countries and locations make mandatory return to work decisions depending on local conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLSEsF"&gt;The most recent plan shared publicly would’ve pushed Google employees back to the office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;at some point in September&lt;/a&gt;, but that won’t happen. Whenever its offices expect to have employees there in-person, Pichai reiterated that there would be a 30-day heads up first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDyPiR"&gt;The letter didn’t directly cite the Delta variant, but waves of infection have again wrangled plans of several Big Tech companies as they consider when and how to have employees in offices again. In May, Pichai outlined&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt; a new hybrid schedule of three in-office days per week&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be several months before that is in play for many of Google’s employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Apple Watch may be delayed due to manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Dip8joi6vMbZfwteRY8D3OW2vg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799013/vpavic_200929_4216_0137.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y7rr4A"&gt;The next Apple Watch is experiencing manufacturing issues that could lead to the product being released later than expected, according to separate reports from &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Watch-production-delayed-as-engineers-wrestle-with-quality-issues"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-31/apple-s-new-watch-will-likely-be-delayed-over-production-snags"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The potential delay is reportedly due to complexities in the smartwatch’s new design, which is rumored to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;flat sides and bigger screens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te1ypv"&gt;Sources told &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; that small-scale production for the next Apple Watch had begun but that it encountered “critical challenges in reaching satisfactory production performance.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported similar details. Production has now been “temporarily halted” while Apple and its suppliers work to solve the manufacturing issues ahead of eventual mass production, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AiXY9p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The next Apple Watch is expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Se0EIi"&gt;The new Apple Watch, expected to be called the Apple Watch Series 7, will see screen size increases to 41mm and 45mm (a 1mm bump from the currently available options), a faster processor, and “a flatter display and edges,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman reported &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-29/who-will-replace-tim-cook-as-the-next-ceo-of-apple-aapl-ksxiq29z"&gt;in his Power On newsletter on Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. While Gurman reported that the Series 7 won’t bring any big health upgrades “until at least next year,” &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that the new Watch will add new features “such as blood pressure measurement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yh9V18"&gt;Apple announced the Apple Watch Series 6 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21430844/apple-event-recap-biggest-announcements-watch-series-6-se-ipad-air"&gt;at an event last September&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is expected to host another September product event this year. Given these reported production challenges with the next Apple Watch, if Apple does host a September event, there’s a possibility the Apple Watch might not make an appearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZL4Ty"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung adds new foldable features to its older Z Fold and Z Flip phones with One UI 3.1.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buD9WNxv5g64Fx49Rs1fERJ5Kw0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798834/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osL0Cu"&gt;Samsung’s new Z Fold 3 and Z Flip 3 phones add a bunch of clever new features designed for foldable phones as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users"&gt;One UI 3.1.1 update&lt;/a&gt;, but if you already own a Fold 2, Z Flip, or even the original Galaxy Fold, you’ll still be able to get some of the new additions without shelling out for a new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PUS8kAXRx8uLumDtDMpWnUamNkw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817418/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_12.32.22_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLFk6Z"&gt;Available on all five foldable models is the new Drag and Split feature, which — as the name implies — allows you to tap and drag on a link to open it side by side with the original webpage or message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWWtZP"&gt;Samsung’s larger Fold models will also be getting the adjustable app windows for its multitasking mode, allowing you to adjust the height and width of the individual apps when you have multiple apps open at once. The older models will also get the automatically rotating app function, custom aspect ratios, and a newly added split view for messaging apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hlnuZ_QEOjBJus5XCBqAGI6Zts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817410/Untitled.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Emj4"&gt;Lastly, for both the Z Fold 2 and the earlier Z Flips, Samsung is adding the option to force apps to use its “Flex mode” that puts video content on one half of a folded display, with playback controls on the other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E41n3o"&gt;Samsung has worked to help keep its older foldables relevant even while rolling out new software features on its newer devices before. It offered a similar update for the original Fold last year when it released the Galaxy Z Fold 2 that added several new features it had introduced with the second-generation foldable. It’s a testament to how new the foldable field is in general. Samsung is still figuring out the best ways to use these new form factors, but it’s also not leaving behind early adopters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YmwIP"&gt;The One UI 3.1.1 update should be rolling out to Fold 2 and Z Flip owners starting today, while the original Galaxy Fold is expected to get the update “around a week later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGwFMQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcBvah"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is expanding its plans to put less politics in the News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z2XUumTAa5OZizQq9E4htPf1a0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798755/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rHXftK"&gt;Facebook is expanding an experiment in reducing political content in the News Feed. In an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/"&gt;update to a February blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it’s seen “positive results” in reducing this content for some users in a handful of countries. Now, it’s expanding a test of the strategy to Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain, and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FFSLY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported on&lt;/a&gt; Facebook’s plans before the announcement. As it notes, Facebook’s new test also involves changing the signals it favors when promoting content. “Some engagement signals can better indicate what posts people find more valuable than others,” product management director Aastha Gupta writes. “Based on that feedback, we’re gradually expanding some tests to put less emphasis on signals such as how likely someone is to comment on or share political content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwMXqo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The tests will put less emphasis on the value of commenting and sharing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJaF0p"&gt;Conversely, Facebook will more heavily weigh signals like “how likely people are to provide us with negative feedback on posts about political topics and current events.” The company acknowledges that this could affect “public affairs content” and decrease traffic to news publishers, and it’s planning a “gradual and methodical rollout” of these tests over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bX4w8e"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276076/facebook-political-posts-reduce-news-feed-tests"&gt;started its politics-reduction tests&lt;/a&gt; in February for some users in Canada, Brazil, the US, and Indonesia. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397583/facebook-news-feed-customer-survey-inspirational-relevant-interests-posts"&gt;It later announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would emphasize “inspiring and uplifting” posts and provide more avenues for people to explicitly indicate what they don’t like — rather than having Facebook infer it from their usage patterns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVZ6qf"&gt;These changes come amid a heated debate over what kinds of interactions matter most on Facebook. Commenting and sharing are some of the rare engagement signals that outsiders can measure, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;they’ve overwhelmingly indicated&lt;/a&gt; that political (and largely right-wing) content dominates people’s interactions on the platform. But Facebook has rejected this framing, saying political content is tangential to most people’s experience — and only &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/11/what-do-people-actually-see-on-facebook-in-the-us/"&gt;makes up 6 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the typical news feed. Now, it’s apparently trying to integrate that philosophy more directly into the feed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy is now selling electric bikes, scooters, and mopeds — in store and online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Buy 2nd Quarter Sales Rise Almost 20 Percent" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJ69Cns6_27dFXos5uD9RhkhSic=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798733/1336158138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AAqrOt"&gt;Best Buy is cruising into the electric mobility space with the announcement that it intends to sell e-bikes, scooters, and mopeds, both in stores and online. The retailer is collecting some of the best known names in lightweight electric vehicles, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054731/unagi-electric-scooter-dual-motor-color-paint-job-customize"&gt;Unagi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632227/bird-electric-bike-owned-price-specs-scooter"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024816/segway-ninebot-electric-moped-scooter-ces-2020"&gt;Segway-Ninebot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22536908/super73-rx-e-bike-review-range-battery-life"&gt;Super73&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fswft-volt-ebike-w-32mi-max-operating-range-19-8-mph-max-speed-black%2F6464288.p%3FskuId%3D6464288&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Swft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r120dS"&gt;Customers interested in buying something right now can visit &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=http%3A%2F%2FBestBuy.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BestBuy.com&lt;/a&gt; to browse the company’s selection. And starting in October, 10 Best Buy stores in nine locations — Austin, Texas; Los Angeles; Miami; New York; Orlando, Florida; Puerto Rico; San Francisco; Seattle; and Tampa, Florida — will start carrying e-bikes and scooters in stock.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oT_ntyMpizvwfLzoP_aNCiKzzB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817250/ETransportation_Secondary.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Best Buy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;E-bikes from Super73 (left) and mopeds from Swft (right) will be available to purchase at Best Buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FTd6B4"&gt;It’s a huge move by a major big-box store that should help steer more customers to e-bikes and scooters, especially as &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;the pandemic has spurred a boom in sales&lt;/a&gt;. Best Buy clearly sees an opportunity to dominate the space, especially in a market saturated with similar-looking products with little to differentiate them aside from brand names and price. Amazon sells a variety of e-bikes and scooters, but it lacks a brick-and-mortar presence where customers can physically interact with the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZlGiJ"&gt;The question is how Best Buy’s emergence as a bike and scooter retailer will affect bottlenecks in the supply chain. Bike shops across the country experienced record sales in the months that followed lockdown, with many selling out completely by the summer. Manufacturer warehouses also had large amounts of empty shelves. Year-over-year sales of bikes for the 12 months ending in April 2021 were up 57 percent, reaching $6.5 billion across both large-format and specialty retailers, &lt;a href="https://www.npd.com/news/blog/2021/switching-gears-are-we-finally-seeing-a-decline-in-bicycle-sales/"&gt;according to NPD&lt;/a&gt;. Today, ordering an e-bike or scooter online typically translates to a 3–4 month wait for delivery, at best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UYX6Qx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The question is how Best Buy’s emergence as a bike and scooter retailer will affect bottlenecks in the supply chain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3EVqqM"&gt;Many bike and scooter companies, especially those that only deal in electric, sell their products directly to consumers, mostly through their own websites and often with a variety of added extras, like assembly instructions and accessories. Best Buy could allow customers to compare prices and products, especially if their product list grows longer and more diversified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14n6pU"&gt;It remains to be seen whether Best Buy can establish itself as a trusted brand in the micromobility marketplace. Shipping e-bikes and scooters through the mail to customers is a fraught business, as VanMoof’s top executives recently admitted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Dutch brand has been plagued with delivery issues, with many customers reporting scuffs and damage on their bikes that occurred during shipping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjwaA"&gt;In addition, Best Buy is offering at-home assembly and fine-tuning for e-bikes through its Geek Squad mobile services for $99.99. Those services include adjusting brakes, seat heights, and handlebars. The arrival of e-bikes and scooters is just in time for Best Buy’s Labor Day sale, during which customers can save up to $300 on select e-transportation products, the company says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77iYeT"&gt;“There’s been incredible innovation in the e-transportation space, and we know more customers are looking for ways to efficiently and sustainably commute,” said Frank Bedo, senior vice president at Best Buy, in a statement. “As we grow this selection, we look forward to helping customers find the right products to fit their needs and supporting them as they hit the road safely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v80JDj"&gt;To be sure, this is sure to put further pressure on local bike shops, which, before the pandemic, have been struggling to compete with low-cost offerings from Amazon. People who own local bike shops are often more knowledgeable about e-bikes and scooters than big-box employees. And they offer maintenance, tuning, and a variety of other services that stores like Best Buy typically do not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpuvz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome beta makes it easy to jump between search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8AW3Xtmz5gFQcv6yAf_mWZzQ6r8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798640/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RQSUgF"&gt;Google is announcing some new experiments available in the latest Chrome beta intended to make it easier to find things on the web and share interesting text. If you want to jump onto the Chrome beta to give these features a shot, download it &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/beta/"&gt;here for your computer&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chrome.beta&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;here for your Android device&lt;/a&gt;. (Though as with all betas, exercise caution, as things may not work perfectly.) And I’m going to mention enabling flags throughout — to do so, enter chrome://flags into your address bar, which is where you can turn on Chrome’s many available experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvMeuR"&gt;One cool new experiment in Chrome on Android lets you see some search results under the address bar after you’ve already navigated to a page. This one is best understood by watching this GIF:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZvdG2yinEVOZWYpi20vYaHNE5Ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817208/Continuous_Search_Mobile.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGsYZT"&gt;Although you can’t see full URLs in this additional bar, it seems like it could be a useful way to jump to another site without having having to go back to the full search results. You can try this experiment by turning on the #continuous-search flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdEuDn"&gt;Another feature in testing lets you make a stylized image of text on websites, which could be useful to spruce up text you want to share with your friends or on social media. (The feature also seems ripe for some ridiculous memes.) This one is available on Android phones and tablets if you flip on the #webnotes-stylize. You can get an idea of how it works in the GIF below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y_W5rEfjgqJDKIHNiup5daJoni8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817224/Webnotes_Mobile.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fYuWU6"&gt;Another new feature adds cards to the New Tab page that makes it easier to jump back to sites you visited previously. In a blog post, Google gives examples of cards for recipe pages, a shopping cart, or documents on Google Drive. If you want to try this out, enable the #ntp-modules flag on a computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dCAv4W2M0DBQrw4lNnGRNzQiuy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817222/Docs_Module_Desktop.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what a card pointing you to previously visited Google Workspace documents looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQpSvW"&gt;Because these are experiments, there’s always the chance that they don’t have all of the bugs ironed out just yet, and Google may decide not to move them past the experiment phase. But they could be previews of features to come, and if you want to try them early, check them out in the Chrome beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVE5iD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Moment’s new video-coloring app Grain will let you take handcrafted presets to other apps </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkFzLvUouOGyEtDhngfRZIvvxZc=/326x0:3770x2296/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798634/grain_press_color_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VScVpG"&gt;Moment &lt;a href="https://apps.shopmoment.com/grain"&gt;is launching another video-focused app&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone and iPad Tuesday that lets you edit and color footage as well as create video presets or “looks” for use on social media or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147761/moment-rtro-video-app-retro-filters-stories-ios-iphone"&gt;Moment’s other video app, Rtro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ9Q30"&gt;The app is called Grain, and based on my experience with it in beta form, it seems to offer a lot of video settings to get lost in. Grain breaks its editing options into three categories: color, effects, and overlays. Color has a variety of preset filters to start with, like LoFi, 35mm, or Blockbuster, which you can then further customize with adjustments to color temperature, brightness, or saturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IY0oSC"&gt;Effects and overlay presets work similarly. You can add film grain, light bleeds, blurs, VHS effects, faux film stocks and fine-tune them with granular controls. Grain also offers gestures to add or remove filters, but I quickly forgot they were an option.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5_vQw8PzbC4WV8cyO8t4-YbNu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808038/Grain_App_WebRes399.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grain offers granular control over individual effects, including more professional-grade tools like color wheels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tQy84I"&gt;As someone who is at best an amateur videographer, the amount of control you can have over an individual video clip can be daunting. Luckily, Grain is designed for as much or as little experimentation as you want. You can produce something interesting just by selecting a color filter and a video effect without diving into menus for fine-tuning. (Though you could arguably just as easily do too much that way.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFlcCyTWnffTwqAogCsm4AIdDGI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22808040/Image__2_.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots of my own disastrous attempt at coloring a clip of my dog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2sRtL"&gt;Video presets you create can be saved for later use or exported as a LUT (Lookup Table) for use in professional desktop software like Adobe Premiere Pro. Grain can also send your presets to Moment’s other video app, Rtro, if you prefer your modified presets to the filters Moment sells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYi2xo"&gt;The catch with Grain is that to get all of the features, you have to be willing to pay. Grain charges $4.99 per month, $29.99 per year, or a one-time payment of $69.99 to unlock advanced color editing tools, unlimited video length, and the ability to export LUTs and overlays. Otherwise, you’re stuck with the basics, and the novel ability to send filters to Rtro. Moment also plans to bundle subscriptions to Grain and Rtro for $6.99 per month or $39.99 per year if you like both apps enough to pay.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Strava’s live location tracking service is now free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQbVGs98V8dAotbqstyyQ6_y5hU=/0x99:1280x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69798593/run_640px.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Athletes can now share their live location using the free version of the Strava app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Strava&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fRj258"&gt;Today Strava is making Beacon, its live location-sharing service for athletes, available to everyone, whether you pay for the popular cycle and run-tracking app or not. Beacon sharing from the Strava app was previously only available via subscription, which currently costs $59.99 annually or $5.00 per month. The change follows a massive privacy push by Strava introduced earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkmaZ0"&gt;Beacon sharing can be used for safety and fun. The feature lets you share your live location with up to three people who can track your progress until you finish. They receive a text message with a unique URL that opens in a mobile browser to show your activity in real time (updated every 15 seconds). This can be a life-saving feature for bikers or runners who find themselves in trouble on a secluded road or trail (safety!) while enabling some serendipitous rendezvousing for any friends who might want to you join you mid-course (fun!). &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3G1Crz"&gt;There is one caveat. Strava says that Beacon sharing from connected devices like the Apple Watch and Garmin bike computers will remain a paid feature due to the complexity of supporting such integrations. Only Beacon sharing from the Strava app on your phone is free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="eWPvZ3"&gt;The free Beacon service follows a major overhaul of Strava’s user privacy options a few weeks ago. These include new “privacy zone” features that give users more control over the accuracy and visibility of their GPS tracking maps beyond just their home, and activity-related features to hide data like heart rate and pace on a per-user basis. &lt;a href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2021/08/strava-new-privacy-zone-features-options.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DC Rainmaker&lt;/em&gt; breaks it all down&lt;/a&gt; in the video above for anyone interested in the details.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For games like Just Dance and EA Sports Active, QA is a tricky process&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WKF7ND"&gt;“I hopped into the lounge, with myself, and was baffled to see that this dumb idea actually worked.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lytqWE"&gt;One day during the testing of &lt;em&gt;Dance Central VR&lt;/em&gt; in the Harmonix office, Robbie Russell was struggling with a very particular problem. They were running a multiplayer check of a social hub feature where up to four players can hang out in a private visual space and take part in dances, play mini-games, or just chat. But everyone else in quality assurance (QA) was busy at the time. So Russell came up with a workaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBeya0"&gt;“You can’t just log someone in and then take the headset off because eventually it’ll time out,” they say. “So me, in my infinite dumbassery, put two headsets on, one Oculus Quest and one Oculus Rift, and strapped two sets of controllers to my wrist. The Rift controllers had holes big enough that I could slip my hands through them and wear them like very stupid bracelets while the Quest controllers fit in my hand normally. That became my go-to way to check multiplayer stuff for the rest of the project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfO9gy"&gt;Finding ways to cheat video game features and mechanics is not uncommon in QA. Testers are expected to dive into each corner of the experience in a thorough manner, often multiple times, to ensure that everything is working as intended. DIY solutions and shortcuts are bound to happen to optimize time. When it comes to QA testing for music and fitness games, however, these hacks aren’t just a way to save time — they’re a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TI5VrM"&gt;The physical component of these genres, all the way from &lt;em&gt;Dance Dance Revolution&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20917908/nintendo-switch-ring-fit-adventure-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has always made them unique. Breaking a sweat with a drum kit in &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt; or strapping a Joy-Con around your leg to go for a jog in Nintendo’s fitness RPG are not experiences you find in most games. But while players can pause or take breaks at any time, testers have to juggle these activities on a 9-5 routine. All of a sudden, the prospect of doing hundreds of jumping jacks or dancing to “What Does The Fox Say” a dozen times per day isn’t as enticing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Wk55ET"&gt;The development of &lt;em&gt;EA Sports Active 2&lt;/em&gt; is a prime example of this complexity and differences from traditional testing. The first in the series was released as a Wii exclusive in May 2009, offering body workouts that required wearing a strappable pouch to hold the Nunchuck controller, alongside a resistance band depending on the exercise. Its sequel, released in November 2010, was multiplatform. This meant that PlayStation 3 players used Move controllers, while Xbox 360 players had the just-released Kinect scanning their full body instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqhofS"&gt;A contract QA tester with Volt Media Consulting working at EA Vancouver at the time, who we’ll be calling Kyle upon his request for anonymity, recalls the project as a nightmare. “It was kinda like one of those Benny Hill sketches where everyone is running around,” he says over a Discord call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arxZmx"&gt;QA was divided into three groups, one per platform, and Kyle was part of the Xbox 360 team. For both him and his co-workers, this meant learning the ins and outs of Kinect’s first iteration. There was no training manual available. Aside from the availability of an engineer (who was also learning on the fly) to verify whether certain bugs came from the game or the Kinect itself, understanding how the hardware worked came purely from trial and error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VG841b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was kinda like one of those Benny Hill sketches where everyone is running around.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WJgI7"&gt;Due to the sensor-tracking nature of the device, the entire office floor had to be adapted. Testers taped off and fragmented the room into triangle-shaped spaces after finding out exactly where the limits of the Kinect’s sensor started and ended, marking the perfect spot — an imaginary box that doesn’t exist for anyone except the hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqZEa0"&gt;Everyone was sharing desks to avoid moving their own all the time — as that would ruin the invisible spot — while being extra careful during walks around the office to prevent being read in somebody else’s triangle. Even jackets hanging on the walls had to be carefully placed. But the worst moments were when the device couldn’t read people at all, whether that was because they were using dark colors or wearing baggy clothes like a hoodie. Figuring out what to wear at work became part of the learning process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYdlk1"&gt;“The Kinect used infrared,” Kyle continues. “In the summer, when it can get over [80 degrees Fahrenheit] in Vancouver, the air conditioner ran through the entire building. If you by chance had one of the massive air vents in your triangle with cold air blowing on you, you would lose your body being read.” Since the Kinect could only read a person by their body temperature, the team had to make covers or lids to block the air conditioning vents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIMjv5"&gt;According to interviews with eight current and former QA workers in AAA studios and outsource companies, not all offices offered the proper accommodation to cover the basic needs of this kind of testing. Elements such as showers, proper ventilation, hydration at hand, and sound-proof spaces varied greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpf4TE"&gt;An anonymous source who worked on &lt;em&gt;Just Dance&lt;/em&gt; for Ubisoft Reflections says the office was well-equipped, including showers and gym mats to dance on. There were around 10 testers on &lt;em&gt;Just Dance 4&lt;/em&gt;, with more at other Ubisoft studios due to co-development. “We had a lot of space and the way they’d set up the consoles and PCs made it easy to test and input bugs quickly,” they add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwFRZd"&gt;While working on &lt;em&gt;Xbox Fitness&lt;/em&gt; at an outsource studio, one former QA recalls the company commissioning a purpose-built gym to be constructed above a kitchen and bathroom stalls, providing ventilation and preventing noise disturbances. In addition, the team was also able to expense appropriate clothing after requesting a budget for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bfvpcO"&gt;The inclusion of properly equipped, separated spaces for QA that work on these types of games is crucial. Not just to keep singing or loud noises at a minimum, but also to divide such different work environments. When daily tasks demand physical activity in the way these tests do, it becomes the equivalent of putting an office and a gym under the same roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXf3yN"&gt;A former QA on &lt;em&gt;Rock Band 4&lt;/em&gt; and the expansion &lt;em&gt;Rock Band Rivals&lt;/em&gt;, as part of the outsourcing studio Keywords, originally worked in a noise-proof room located within the main floor. The company later had it torn down to expand the space, so QA (composed of around 16 testers) was relocated with everybody else. “I tested mainly drums and vocals which is an obvious distraction for everybody,” they mention. “Couldn’t do much about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5lNTn"&gt;At the Harmonix office, Russell (who is currently a senior QA at Proletariat working on &lt;em&gt;Spellbreak&lt;/em&gt;) adds that there was a dedicated room for drum testing in &lt;em&gt;Rock Band&lt;/em&gt;, and meeting rooms would often be booked entirely to do full-band runs when needed. But for the most part, people would “always hear somebody clacking away at a guitar or quietly humming at their desk to test vocal pitches.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H5W4Xd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You’re gonna get sweaty eventually”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GsbgRi"&gt;There was plenty of room for QA to do their jobs safely as well as hydration available. Sadly, aside from a member-exclusive gym in the building (which was free for salaried employees), there were no office showers available. This is similar to how amenities worked in EA Vancouver. According to Kyle, there were showers and lockers available in the gym, but only full-time employees had access to it. The &lt;em&gt;EA Sports Active 2&lt;/em&gt; QA team, due to how chaotic the project was, was granted this privilege. But this wasn’t the norm for contractors. “It was kind of encouraged among the team to take breaks and not overexert yourself,” Russell explains. “But it’s rapid physical activity, you’re gonna get sweaty eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXwCcP"&gt;Caelyn Sandel, &lt;em&gt;Caves of Qud&lt;/em&gt; developer and former QA at Harmonix, recalls the encouragement for “everyone to bathe regularly” from the team leads. “I’m not saying it never got ripe, but it wasn’t a persistent issue.” That being said, Sandel recalls a specific day that stood out from the rest. “One time the HVAC system had some kind of crisis and that smelled so bad that we all evacuated and went to Flour Bakery. That was a fun day except for the horrible stink.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WB7Wy"&gt;The lack of widely available showers isn’t unique to Harmonix or EA. During a CEDEC 2020 presentation reported by &lt;a href="https://www.famitsu.com/news/202009/04205252.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Famitsu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and translated by PushDustin on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PushDustIn/status/1301880802553155586"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it was mentioned that the &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; office only had one, so the testing team would have to wait sometimes. (Nintendo declined our request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XL4l7E"&gt;The intensity of the required effort from testers, even as they all juggle far more ordinary QA tasks in between (inputting bugs, working on tickets on platforms such as JIRA, maintaining databases, and so on), can lead to a myriad of results. Not all QAs are professional drummers, dancers, or fitness trainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPo8g4"&gt;Two of the developers recall how the constant movement and exercising helped them to get in better shape, one case being the result of the studio hiring professional dancers who had teaching experience and would lead testers through stretches and better practices. For others, the training activity during the day job was a compliment to already established exercising / health habits, while a few opted to not change theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kM3qJD"&gt;While pretty much everyone I spoke to mentioned ways in which they could get away with reducing the physical workload, it’s important to note that tests that involved completionist achievements or high difficulties would usually require traditional testing. Without the possibility of workarounds, some tests could only be done by someone who excelled at the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwSzZ7"&gt;These logistics are part of daily planning. For a studio like Harmonix, this meant making sure there were enough working instruments for particular tests, knowing who in the office had a reliable vibrato to test out certain exploits on vocals, and, ultimately, recognizing whether there was someone who had the required level of skill to test specific bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDMMke"&gt;Some cases could be bypassed by just playing in lower difficulties, but the full spectrum had to be tested at some point to avoid inaccurate results. Drum testing a fake plastic kit might not seem like much — yet, as Russell points out, playing it at a decent skill level “is a huge burden and often caused a lot of issues.” If the two people who were good enough at them to play on the expert difficulty weren’t in the office, then those bugs had to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKfrYf"&gt;In most cases, testers were able to take breaks throughout the day without objection from leads or management, sometimes outside of settled company breaks as well. EA, for example, offered two 15-minute breaks across mornings and evenings, on top of the lunch hour. Everyone would usually be understanding, allowing QA to trade tasks between them and, once again, encouraging them to find ways to cheat exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="r7JC4j"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks5LRAadl7M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9GGYtI"&gt;Based on those I interviewed, studios and managers mostly had the right intentions in terms of setting healthy boundaries. But in practice, issues often took place. Testers who suffered any kind of injury outside of work still had to put up with physical testing, although there was a push to focus more on administrative work during the recovery periods. Scenarios like this, however, are inevitable — even in safe and accommodating environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdnw6C"&gt;Two particular cases stood out during interviews. An anonymous QA who worked on the Nintendo DS game &lt;em&gt;New International Track &amp;amp; Field&lt;/em&gt; says that while there weren’t any set breaks, the team didn’t need to put 100 percent effort in, except for high-end tasks or multiplayer tests. The latter would get “a bit too competitive” when the producers would ask the team to take part in a game mode that involved playing every event back to back. Producers would claim the testers wouldn’t be able to beat them, staking “free morning Starbucks on the challenge” as an incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcyKcA"&gt;A similar scenario took place in EA for &lt;em&gt;EA Sports Active 2&lt;/em&gt; by a POC (point of contact). Back in the day, they acted as a contact intermediary for managers or developers to get and spread work orders to employees. While our source is unsure whether this came as an order, he recalls a voluntary incentive for testers: whoever lost the most weight under a certain period of time would receive a prize. The reward was a one-month gym pass or a punch card that could be used for a gym or yoga class, one-on-one training, or even a consultation with a chiropractor, all activities that were already available for full-time employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s4jRAT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We were up late and kind of delirious, fueling ourselves on stress and whiskey.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2tomXA"&gt;On social media, it’s common to see people joking around how QA testers who work on these games must be in excellent shape, but the reality is far more difficult to parse. Office preparations and day-to-day responsibilities play a big role, but so do each person’s capabilities and health conditions. In most cases, the aforementioned problems do nothing but strengthen or add upon the issues already in place that testers have to deal with across the video game industry as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iudOxf"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-interactives-qa-staff-allege-poor-treatment-low-pay-and-mismanaged-layoffs"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Paradox Interactive, one tester mentions how the team “often got overlooked and it was very, very obvious that QA was lowest down on the hierarchical ladder.” During an interview with &lt;a href="https://egmnow.com/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-qa-tester/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;EGM&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a contractor who worked on &lt;em&gt;Titanfall 2&lt;/em&gt; paints a similar picture to the clear and enforced distinction between salaried employees and contractors, as the latter are often subject to lower pay and lack of benefits. In that same report, another source calls working QA for VR projects a “horrific job.” Both &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/01/05/video-game-internships/"&gt;internships and contract work&lt;/a&gt; are especially common with young developers, offering a foot in the industry in exchange for deplorable conditions. In many cases, QA is considered a stepping stone instead of receiving the same recognition as any other role in game development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJrKuZ"&gt;Sandel considers her time at Harmonix a “weird employment experience,” as she was kept as a contractor (alongside the professional dancers hired for &lt;em&gt;Dance Central 2&lt;/em&gt;) for two years with “no benefits and low pay.” She mentions it was a different world after getting hired full-time for &lt;em&gt;Dance Central 3&lt;/em&gt;. “Harmonix’s healthcare coverage is the best in the industry by a country mile. I’m still kicking myself for only transitioning after I stopped working there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhGv6H"&gt;For many testers, one of the things that made these challenging conditions more tolerable was the camaraderie that emerged from working with a small team on intense projects. “I have this really strong positive memory from close to the end of &lt;em&gt;Dance Central’s&lt;/em&gt; production,” Sandel says, “trying to record the filter data for individual moves over and over because the first scoring system was a mess. We were up late and kind of delirious, fueling ourselves on stress and whiskey. We crunched a lot for the first game and I definitely sort of fell for the exhilaration of it, which was helped by how personable and fun to be around the team members were. Thankfully, crunch eased up a bit on subsequent projects, but we did still crunch.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JznmlH"&gt;The former Ubisoft QA recalls their time working on the &lt;em&gt;Just Dance&lt;/em&gt; series with “a massive wave of nostalgia” as they “genuinely had so much fun on that project.” They fondly remember one specific contraption called “Sweaty Betty,” which involved strapping a controller to a desk fan to test the scoring during &lt;em&gt;Just Dance 3&lt;/em&gt;’s development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um6RQO"&gt;But the series’s tight schedule often resulted in late nights. “It’s difficult for me to critically analyze exactly why there was so much overtime on that project since I was so new to the industry at the time, but &lt;em&gt;Just Dance&lt;/em&gt; was usually featured at E3 too so there was a lot of work to get that ready for the reveal.” The source adds that at that point in time in their career, they were “extremely stoked to be in the industry, so I kind of expected it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mqik8r"&gt;According to Kyle, in order to avoid overtime, the team was split into day and night shifts. During the last few months of development, EA put budget aside to offer employees working late nights “10 to 15 dollars” toward the campus’s own restaurant for dinner. A second Volt Media contractor recalls taking part in the so-called “graveyard shifts.” During the last month or two of the project, some shifts would go from 8AM to 8PM, while the other half of the team worked 8PM to 8AM. The source did about five nights a week.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="z8DE7S"&gt;While most of the stories from the developers I spoke to happened years ago, it’s worth noting that the issues surrounding QA &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466"&gt;continue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-06-26-stories-of-crunch-contempt-for-qa-at-treyarch"&gt;to this&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22622396/activision-blizzard-toxic-culture-qa-customer-service-report"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt;. Music and fitness games have their own particular challenges when the work conditions aren’t suitable for the physical task at hand. But at the very least, this also opens the door to inventive solutions. As absurd and anecdotal as they may sound, they’re often a lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEQno"&gt;During a graveyard shift, the second EA contractor recalls one time when the team was asked to test the Kinect in low-light situations. Since the project was one of the first games for the hardware, the UX was uncharted territory. This, of course, led to its own array of experimental testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="s4vqeE"&gt;“For a lot of us, around 5AM, when your last two brain cells have decided they’ve had enough, that’s when the real ingenuity kicks in,” the source concludes. “To ensure the game would pick up the user’s motions in a low-light environment, some of us ended up using a combination of cubicle walls and blankets to build tunnels that we would modify to allow more or less light in to see how the game responded. It’s the only time in my life I’ve been paid to build blanket forts.”&lt;/p&gt;
