    <title>Discord now shares more details of your EA gameplay</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xMkhhP"&gt;EA is adding support for Discord’s “Rich Presence” feature to some of its titles, which allows your Discord contacts to see more information about what you’re up to in-game, the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/news/ea-discord-rich-presence?isLocalized=true"&gt;game maker has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It works by linking your Discord account with the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/news/ea-app"&gt;EA App&lt;/a&gt;, the new launcher that’s a successor to EA’s Origin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjN8f3"&gt;Previously, Discord would show what EA game you were playing, and for how long. But EA’s Rich Presence integration allows Discord to show off more detailed information like “which game mode you’re in, how long you’ve been playing, and whether or not you’re ready to partner up for something different,” EA says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="64lyK2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’ll even show if you’re interested in partnering up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nHMTL"&gt;Discord’s &lt;a href="https://discord.com/rich-presence"&gt;Rich Presence feature&lt;/a&gt; is already supported across other games like &lt;em&gt;Payday 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlerite&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;/em&gt;, but EA’s integration has the potential to be a lot broader because it’s happening at the launcher level (via the EA App) rather than the individual game level. As well as showing more information about the game you’re playing, developers can also use it to allow players to invite each other to their games, or to spectate their friends’ matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWYJXi"&gt;You can enable the new Discord integration in the &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-app-beta"&gt;EA App&lt;/a&gt; by heading into Settings, selecting My Account, and scrolling down to the Connected Accounts section and authorizing a link between your Discord and EA accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla pulled its latest ‘Full Self Driving’ beta after testers complained about false crash warnings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yg-own5UM7gyR_M6vvhY2Ps37M8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70039535/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hb1LmE"&gt;Tesla’s decision to test its “Full Self Driving” advanced driver assistance software with untrained vehicle owners on public roads has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;, and that was before this latest release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROpYYm"&gt;Version 10.3 began rolling out on Saturday night / Sunday morning with &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qem0lu/fsd_bets_103_release_notes/"&gt;a long list of release notes&lt;/a&gt;. The list mentions changes starting with introducing driver profiles that can swap between different characteristics for following distance, rolling stops, or exiting passing lanes. It’s supposed to better detect brake lights, turn signals, and hazard lights from other vehicles, along with reduced false slowdowns and improved offsetting for pedestrians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhd4yD"&gt;However, on Sunday afternoon Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla is “Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QYMrRz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seeing some issues with 10.3, so rolling back to 10.2 temporarily. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please note, this is to be expected with beta software. It is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public beta.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452345284483235841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U72sUl"&gt;(As always, to be clear: this software does not make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself even said that he believes the “feature complete” version of the software his company calls “Full Self-Driving” will, at best, only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision. That does not describe a fully autonomous car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSWpau"&gt;While several drivers have already &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4GTtBe2eOhk"&gt;shared&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_hn-Iu4Y7M"&gt;videos and impressions&lt;/a&gt; of their experience with the release — whether or not that aligns with what Tesla wants participants to share on social media — testers say that the rollback update removes the FSD beta capabilities from their cars entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWSAjH"&gt;While several posters said the 10.3 update introduces phantom forward collision warnings (FCW), &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/qeu10x/known_fsd_beta_103_taccautosteer_bug/"&gt;other issues noted&lt;/a&gt; included a disappearing Autosteer option, traffic aware cruise control (TACC) problems, and occasional AutoPilot panic. It’s unclear how common these problems are and which ones, if any, caused the rollback, but Musk responded to a tweet about the Autosteer and TACC issues &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452330803015335939"&gt;saying the company is working on it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7kmYq"&gt;If it’s a common problem within the test group, then a phantom FCW would certainly be serious enough to initiate a rollback. &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-25-mazda3-smart-braking-system-recall.html"&gt;In 2019 there was a Mazda3 recall&lt;/a&gt; to address problems with the Smart Braking System falsely detecting objects in the car’s path. If another car follows closely, vehicles that suddenly slam on the brakes for no reason — as several social media posts claim has happened —  could easily cause an accident. Another problem for testers is that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeslaTomMY1/status/1452360696281264132"&gt;several claimed&lt;/a&gt; the false FCW incidents lowered their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;Tesla-graded “safety score”&lt;/a&gt; low enough that they might not be able to remain in the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="h8buPh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Safety regulator wants info on Tesla’s FSD beta, ‘safety score’ evaluation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"},{"title":"Tesla privately admits Elon Musk has been exaggerating about ‘full self-driving’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xwjln8"&gt;For anyone concerned with being an unwilling member of the test group by simply existing near a Tesla using work-in-progress software, this could be a sign that the company is addressing problems quickly or an example of how dangerous it is. On the other hand, for Tesla owners hoping the test expands to include people with a lower safety score, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1448066773589401606"&gt;hacker @greentheonly tweets&lt;/a&gt;, “To those of you with low scores that wait for the FSD: don’t. Imagine if you drove the way the app requires, that would be horrible, right? But the car drives even worse! It’s seriously totally unusable in any sort of traffic and on narrow roads, the videos don’t do it justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RovYf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Similar to how I don't use stopping light control the current of iteration is something I'd want off outside of limited experiments, but unlike TL stopping mode you cannot turn off FSD annoyances!&lt;br&gt;(hopefully it improves, but knowing Tesla, that's long ways off)&lt;/p&gt;— green (@greentheonly) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1448066775120293888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Tesla quietly raises prices on four of its EVs</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RqOp5CwY5PfqMUuorCpfSuVstCU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70038821/akrales_170310_1493_A_0426.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HIXAnv"&gt;Tesla quietly raised prices of four of its electric vehicles this weekend, a few days after the automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;announced a record $1.6 billion profit&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter. First reported by &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/23/tesla-increases-model-s-model-x-prices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; the base Model 3 and Model Y electric vehicles are each priced $2,000 higher, at $43,990 and $56,990 respectively. In addition, the base Model S and Model X vehicles will each cost $5,000 more, at $94,990 and  $104,990&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTvgrj"&gt;Tesla had a banner third quarter despite the global semiconductor shortage that has plagued other carmakers. Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464552/tesla-price-increases-supply-chain-pressure-chip-shortage-elon-musk"&gt;Elon Musk said in June&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s incremental price hikes on the Model 3 and Model Y during the first half of 2021 were due in large part to supply chain shortages. But the company was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite its vehicle software&lt;/a&gt; so it could support alternate chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UP6QU8"&gt;Other automotive companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/volkswagen-sees-global-chip-shortage-worsening-in-second-half-11625861486"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22619190/ford-mustang-mach-e-chip-shortage-delay-6-weeks-250kwh"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632330/toyota-production-japan-north-america-chip-shortage-ford-tesla-gm-vw"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have not been as fortunate, taking measures like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;increasing vehicle prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;temporarily shuttering factories&lt;/a&gt; to try to weather the chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUDDl2"&gt;Tesla hasn’t offered an explanation for the latest price hikes, but company CFO Zach Kirkhorn said during its third quarter earnings call with investors that the increased demand for electric vehicles “caught us a little bit off guard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Quh2YC"&gt;“Sometimes, to the public, our pricing changes may not seem to make logical sense,” Kirkhorn said. “But, you know, there is a strategy that we work behind the scenes as we’re balancing supply and demand, as we’re also trying to balance various shortages on parts, as we’re trying to manage wait times. All of that goes into the optimization here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qCjQQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 24th 2:04PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added more detailed quote from Tesla CFO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9qXAq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: King Richard, Uncharted, Ozark, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d16irDDCqUFRyyjs1fhfaUynvr8=/59x0:1345x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70038175/will_smith_in_king_richard.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Will Smith stars as Venus and Serena Williams’ father in King Richard | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FIsNbpJIa6k&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wh5VJq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; is back, thank goodness, and with it the awkward bravado of Kendall Roy, who would like his Twitter to be off the hook and whose plan to take over his family’s empire is essentially a series of hashtaggable platitudes. Still the squirmiest show on streaming!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1l8BH"&gt;Here’s this week’s trailers roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ez3EW5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIsNbpJIa6k?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fQBY3D"&gt;King Richard &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2DKa43"&gt;Will Smith stars in &lt;em&gt;King Richard, &lt;/em&gt;the story of Serena and Venus Williams, told from the point of view of their father, whose determination (which is putting it mildly) helped drive his daughters to be the greatest tennis players of their generation. Smith’s performance in &lt;em&gt;King Richard,&lt;/em&gt; which debuted at the Telluride Film Festival in September, is already generating &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/awards/awards/king-richard-oscars-will-smith-1235056175/"&gt;Oscar buzz&lt;/a&gt; and honestly it’s not hard to see why from this second trailer. And yes, that is a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/10/beyonc-song-be-alive-king-richard-trailer.html"&gt;new Beyonce song&lt;/a&gt;. The Williams sisters are executive producers of &lt;em&gt;King Richard,&lt;/em&gt; which also stars Saniyya Sidney, Demi Singleton, Aunjanue Ellis, and Jon Bernthal. It comes to theaters and HBO Max on November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jfs4ej"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZOnOfc83Q0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="cP6SCD"&gt;Uncharted&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FdZfqv"&gt;Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie version of the adventures of Nathan Drake has been in development for more than a decade. Serving as a prequel to the game, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; finds Drake in search of Magellan’s treasure when he meets Victor “Sully” Sullivan. That cargo plane scene will look familiar to fans of the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 3&lt;/em&gt; game. Tom Holland, Mark Wahlberg, Sophia Ali, Tati Gabrielle, and Antonio Banderas star in &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters (really!) on February 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2M7APg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNq9YOfL0Zs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lkBOam"&gt;The Lost Daughter &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IsIRG6"&gt;Olivia Colman plays a woman watching a young mother on vacation, but in a way that feels unsettling, almost stalker-y. When the younger woman’s daughter goes missing on the beach, we get the sense that there’s something not quite right about the older woman, and wonder who the lost daughter of the title might really be. Based on the novel by Elena Ferrante, &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt; is the directorial debut of Maggie Gyllenhaal. Along with Colman, Dakota Johnson, Ed Harris, Peter Sarsgaard, Jessie Buckley, and Paul Mescal star in &lt;em&gt;The Lost Daughter&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Netflix December 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iuR9Ul"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F1uFan_KgBw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dZIc39"&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks1e8e"&gt;Catherine gets crowned at last, telling husband Peter that her title only seems arrogant “if you’re not great. If you are, it’s just calling things what they are.” Ah, there’s nothing quite like an 18th-century tale of intrigue and family dysfunction. Elle Fanning and Nicholas Hoult return in &lt;em&gt;The Great&lt;/em&gt; which has its second-season debut on  Hulu November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qXxqr3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/61bYZ9Y0Nrs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2iRJtJ"&gt;Ozark &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zH1g5L"&gt;We finally have a date for the fourth and final season of &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt;, the story of the money-laundering Byrde family. We don’t get much else new in this teaser/trailer, but see Jason Bateman and Laura Linney walking through a gate with his voiceover saying “Today is a beginning.” &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; returns to Netflix on January 21st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScHh6y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z362On"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Estimated ship times for preorders of new MacBook Pro models now into late November, early December</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ship times for MacBook Pro models have slid into December&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KMB2mj"&gt;Shipping estimates on the Apple Store for new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro pre-orders have started sliding into late November and early December. As of Sunday morning, estimates for the standard configurations of the 14-inch MacBook Pro were showing delivery dates between November 16th and 23rd. Customizing a 14-inch Pro could push the estimated delivery into mid-December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NDwe3"&gt;For the 16-inch MacBook Pro, standard configurations are showing estimated shipping times between November 23rd and December 1st, with customized options also showing mid-December ship dates depending what you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TCKQdWaWZ27b0qLunkAKIbQf1NU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22951561/Screen_Shot_2021_10_24_at_9.01.03_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Apple Online Store showing estimated shipping dates for the new 16-inch MacBook Pro as of October 24th.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h-shipping-times-for-new-orders-continue-to-slip"&gt;Apple introduced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22724738/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-features-price-release-date"&gt;14-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22727213/apple-macbook-pro-16-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;16-inch&lt;/a&gt; MacBook Pro laptops at its “Unleashed” event on October 18th. The new design eliminates the Touch Bar in favor of a full-sized function row. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"&gt;added a notch&lt;/a&gt; to MacBook Pro screens for the first time, and brought back more port options, including an HDMI port, three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card slot, and a headphone jack. &lt;/p&gt;

The new laptops will also have Apple’s adaptive refresh rate technology ProMotion, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733122/apple-macbook-pro-mini-led-display-120hz-promotion-refresh-rates"&gt;Mini-LED&lt;/a&gt; 120Hz refresh displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9rVOk"&gt;The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, and the 16-inch model starts at $2,499. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sounds like the Halo Needler is finally getting the Nerf blaster it deserves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35MLQ0QPCFE0hQ0gZRL5aa94uMg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70036749/halo_needler_nerf_lmtd.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zoJAwQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;Needler is one of the most memorable video game weapons ever designed: an alien rifle that shoots homing spikes of crystalline plasma &lt;em&gt;that explode&lt;/em&gt;. While clearly taking some inspiration from &lt;a href="https://fifth-element.fandom.com/wiki/Zorg_ZF-1_Pod_Weapon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt;’s “replay gun”&lt;/a&gt; in shape and functionality, it’s gained a following of its own. Now, Hasbro has announced a foam-firing Nerf replica of the Needler that might finally do it justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmzkHH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/hasbro-pulsecon-2021/products/nerf-lmtd-halo-needler"&gt;The $100 Nerf LMTD Halo Needler&lt;/a&gt; follows the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627453/nerf-aliens-pulse-rifle-preorder-hasbro-gamestop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt; Pulse Rifle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;Amban Phase-pulse blaster&lt;/a&gt; in asking the question: what if Hasbro built a cosplay-grade Nerf blaster for its biggest fans instead of something that needs to sell like a toy? The answer is a 10-round fully automatic dart blaster with light-up spikes whose lights automatically wink out as you fire each dart, mimicking how each needle disappears when you play a &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;game. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEDecgeik-WzMIyIL7IDWjAEqZQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950864/halo_needler_real_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;What the current prototype looks like lit up.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZygKmr"&gt;It’s not a flywheel blaster, either, not the kind that spits out darts by flinging them between two wheels (and creating potentially annoying spin-up sounds). Just resting your finger on the trigger will turn on the Needler’s lights, and pulling it activates the full mechanism at once: a motor-driven series of gears that pulls a spring-loaded plunger back to fire and advance the drum.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ynLTAalMruTFW-rGQ1UNaDtZM0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950862/halo_needler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vmnnxf"&gt;That’s instantly &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; much better than previous attempts at the Needler,&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JO0WgM4MUh8"&gt; like the awkward BoomCo version&lt;/a&gt; that required an extra hand to prime a long, uncanonical handle at the bottom, or &lt;a href="https://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us/product/nerf-microshots-halo-needler-blaster:CDACEDC9-9F96-42D1-8C80-A7A55D0FE333"&gt;this quick earlier cash-in from Nerf.&lt;/a&gt; It takes 6 AA batteries, and for the substantial price you’ll also get a stand to display it. (You can leave the blaster lit up in display mode.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ax8xA"&gt;You can find it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09HMWZ6F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.entertainmentearth.com%2Fproduct%2Fhalo-nerf-lmtd-needler-dartfiring-blaster%2Fhsf5487&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F23%2F22742194%2Fhalo-needler-nerf-lmtd-announce-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Entertainment Earth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Ftoys-games%2Fnerf%2Fproducts%2Fnerf-lmtd-halo-needler-blaster-with-light-up-needles%2F11168848.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/collections/hasbro-pulsecon-2021/products/nerf-lmtd-halo-needler"&gt;Hasbro Pulse&lt;/a&gt;, but know it could take a &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; time to arrive: it’s not due out till the end of 2022. It’s still in development, though Hasbro showed off an early working version &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3X-mHGlKAfE?t=8075"&gt;on its livestream today&lt;/a&gt; around the 2 hour, 14-minute mark.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reverses controversial .NET change after open source community outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hk9xo12dVBcAczTWIsrC-5ZOh0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70036382/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ZHY0b"&gt;Microsoft is reversing a decision to remove a key feature from its upcoming .NET 6 release, after a public outcry from the open source community. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source"&gt;Microsoft angered the .NET open source community earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; by removing a key part of Hot Reload in the upcoming release of .NET 6, a feature that allows developers to modify source code while an app is running and immediately see the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pO3xl"&gt;It’s a feature many had been looking forward to using in Visual Studio Code and across multiple platforms, until Microsoft made a controversial last-minute decision to lock it to Visual Studio 2022 which is a mostly paid product that’s limited to Windows. Sources at Microsoft, speaking on condition of anonymity&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the last-minute change was made by Julia Liuson, the head of Microsoft’s developer division, and was a business-focused move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p6IEjr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft admits it made a mistake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CfMZjB"&gt;Microsoft has now reversed the change following a backlash, and anger inside the company from many of Microsoft’s own employees. “We made a mistake in executing on our decision and took longer than expected to respond back to the community,” &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/"&gt;explains Scott Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, director of program management for .NET. Microsoft has now approved the community’s pull request to re-enable this feature and it will be available in the final version of the .NET 6 SDK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekGdO0"&gt;We asked Microsoft to comment on the fact an executive ordered the change, but the company didn’t want to discuss the controversial decision. “We have taken steps to address the issue that some of our OSS community members have experienced,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Hot Reload capability will be in the general availability build of the .NET 6 SDK available on November 8th.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgkZw6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/"&gt;Microsoft’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t address this controversial decision, though. Instead, it suggests it was simply a mistake to remove the code instead of simply disabling it, and not a business decision. “In our effort to scope, we inadvertently ended up deleting the source code instead of just not invoking that code path,” says Hunter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHSPA-agOEGe1VmM6llX-ehG8cc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22950560/hotreload.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hot Reload lets developers instantly see code changes while apps are running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pGdaeY"&gt;While the reversal will be a welcome one for the .NET community, the explanation and circumstances around this incident won’t sit easy with those who value transparency around such decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvCBcJ"&gt;“As is true with many companies, we are learning to balance the needs of OSS community and being a corporate sponsor for .NET,” says Hunter. “Sometimes we don’t get it right. When we don’t, the best we can do is learn from our mistakes and be better moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43O2xJ"&gt;This eventful episode came after &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/05/microsoft_net_foundation_under_fire/"&gt;weeks of unrest in the .NET community over Microsoft’s involvement in the .NET Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. The foundation was created in 2014 when Microsoft made .NET open source, and it’s supposed to be an independent organization that exists to improve open source software development and collaboration for .NET. A resigning board member questioned the role of the .NET Foundation recently, asking whether it’s “here to enforce Microsoft’s will on .NET open source, or are you here to help foster and promote a healthy community?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liLzXJ"&gt;A recent controversy also led to .NET Foundation executive director Claire Novotny &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/11/dotnet_foundation_community_issues/"&gt;resigning recently&lt;/a&gt; and others &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/18/net_foundation_gnome/"&gt;questioning the independence&lt;/a&gt; of the .NET Foundation given Microsoft’s special privileges. Microsoft has certainly damaged some of the open source work it has been building on for 10 years with this u-turn, and the company still has plenty of work ahead to improve relations with the .NET community and the issues around its influence on the .NET Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse will soon let you pin links to the top of rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYC94pzSfnuH8QniERl2t5n3HVM=/0x0:9997x6665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035962/clubhouse1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G1Jcrr"&gt;Clubhouse is making it possible for people to share outside links and monetize their work on the platform. Today at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s On The Verge event, Clubhouse CEO Paul Davison and global head of marketing Maya Watson announced a new &lt;a href="https://blog.clubhouse.com/introducing-pinned-links-so-many-new-ways-to-use-rooms/"&gt;pinned links&lt;/a&gt; feature, which allows moderators to place outside links at the top of a room. These links can direct listeners to whatever moderators want, like a Patreon page, a news article, or a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2tA7M"&gt;Certain links won’t be allowed for security and moderation reasons. Davison didn’t explicitly name the types of links that &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t &lt;/em&gt;be allowed, but he suggested links to OnlyFans wouldn’t be accepted because links to porn are banned. Anyone can add, change, or remove a link, so long as they’re a moderator of a room and regardless of the number of followers they have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSD72e"&gt;The feature rolls out October 27th for both iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBsFFh"&gt;Clubhouse won’t take a cut of revenue from any transactions that occur through the link, although Davison said the team would likely share news in the upcoming months about ways in which the app itself will monetize, like through ticketed rooms and subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7vTIao"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 100vh;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 100%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/638068075?h=1354dab266&amp;amp;app_id=122963&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get a year of PlayStation Plus for just $39 this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXsYgLBoOBejxphQZtd_mGIUU2E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70035081/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="69NfPM"&gt;For this weekend, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a whole year of Playstation Plus at Eneba for just $39&lt;/a&gt; by using the code &lt;strong&gt;365USVERGE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Anyone who owns a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 should consider becoming a PlayStation Plus subscriber. By becoming one, you get access to a variety of perks, including online multiplayer, cloud storage for saves, and complementary games every month, as well as exclusive discounts. This discount is only valid through Saturday, October 23rd, though, so you’ll have to move fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MTpAQO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVCvda"&gt;A sharp, new entry in the Logitech arsenal of gaming accessories is the Logitech G305, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B086PJKVVT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for just $40 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to its lowest price since January. This false ambidextrous, wireless mouse features six programmable buttons and a 12K DPI sensor. A single AA battery powers the mouse, and while it isn’t rechargeable, the G305 claims to have a 250-hour lifespan on a single battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJN2D6"&gt;While the specs on this mouse are certainly nothing to scoff at, the real selling point is the variety of colorways available for this peripheral. Besides the typical black and white, the G305 also comes in teal, blue, and lavender. It may not be the lightest mouse on the market, but at a meager 99 grams, the G305 definitely falls into the featherweight category.&lt;/p&gt;

This versatile smart hub features an 8-inch screen and adds touchscreen functionality to the ubiquitous Alexa platform. Pull up recipes, watch news highlights, or even make video calls with the new and improved built-in 13MP camera. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our review&lt;/a&gt; called the second-generation Echo Show “still the best Alexa smart display” and was particularly impressed by the new camera and robust speaker quality. If you aren’t yet an Alexa user, the Echo Show 8 is a great introduction to this helpful service. In case you miss out on this deal, it typically comes around every month or so. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1zjHYl"&gt;The Sony WF-1000XM3 wireless, noise-canceling earbuds have hit an all-time low at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747336499962657708" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and are available for just $128. These classy earbuds feature excellent sound quality, effective noise cancellation, and can last for up to six hours on a single charge. They are slightly more bulky than Apple’s AirPods Pro and don’t include wireless charging or water resistance, but the aesthetics and overall sound quality of these earbuds are certainly still best-in-class. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RJE6HB"&gt;The cringey humor of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3 &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;its first year of DLC can be yours today for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Borderlands-Ultimate-Xbox-Digital-Code/dp/B08NDTLLYX?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This digital code Xbox version of Borderlands Ultimate Edition has had its price cut in half and includes the base game as well as four massive chunks of DLC and a ton of cosmetic options. The writing of the Borderlands series has always been divisive, but regardless of your stance on poop humor, the gameplay remains extremely addictive. A staple of the loot-shooter genre, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; marries a virtually limitless number of weapon combinations with RPG-style character builds and its own unique brand of comedy. While it definitely has more than enough features and content for an engaging single-player experience, the game also supports up to four players via online co-op.

We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With official Matter support, Eero mesh routers could soon run your smart home</title>

  &lt;p id="23IKpk"&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;literally right now &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;celebrating &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s 10-year anniversary in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, but we couldn’t throw an epic two-day event without also bringing you a teensy bit of tech news — and Eero co-founder and CEO Nick Weaver just did that at &lt;em&gt;On The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Weaver says that Eero, an early adopter of the Thread protocol, will be upgrading all its Thread-equipped Wi-Fi routers to fully support Matter as well. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is the upcoming 2022 standard that should allow for easier setup of smart home devices, with any compatible Matter host able to discover and work with any Matter client. Amazon smart home rivals Apple and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"&gt;Google are also on board&lt;/a&gt; with Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SArPKS"&gt;“It does feel different this time,” Weaver says, asked about his company’s long support for Thread, a protocol that hadn’t shown any signs of taking off until it became part of the Matter standard. Now, many Eeros are primed to make far greater use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJL7Cu"&gt;Weaver also mentioned on stage that Eero has been exploring the idea of a cellular backup system for the Eero routers, similar to how parent company Amazon’s other brand Ring uses a cellular backup for its alarm system, though Weaver didn’t make any promises today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WZDgI358CqIfHstqNzDwtg8xkG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22949797/IMG_1277.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="idusrh"&gt;When we asked whether he’s seeing any competition from cellular providers (which now offer 5G home connections that can come with their own routers), whether he sees a trend there, he seemed to brush off the idea. “The biggest trend we are seeing is people are upgrading to gigabit in droves,” he says. He says that Eero has seen 75 percent growth in its business selling Eero to ISPs. “ISPs don’t want to get service calls about their Wi-Fi routers, that’s why they go with us,” he tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNxkgb"&gt;Weaver says the company currently designs routers independent of your internet connection — however good or bad your ISP connection is doesn’t really factor in. Right now, it’s the last mile (or realistically, the last hundred feet) to turn your cable or fiber connection into Wi-Fi across your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzpIP4"&gt;In case you’re curious what’s on Weaver’s own home network, he told Nilay and Dieter that his long list of devices includes a smart oven — and there’s an Apple HomeKit bridge among his many hubs.&lt;/p&gt;

Eero has supported HomeKit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
