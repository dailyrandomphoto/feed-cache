    <title>What’s on your desk, Taylor Lyles? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQXNtIAn-pH83zaecuXCC5kB97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851875/tlyles_201113_4294_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An enthusiastic gamer creates her workspace&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uJLbW5"&gt;Moving to a home office sometimes means making the most of a little space. Taylor Lyles, a writer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is one of those who has used imagination and tech know-how to create a great working area out of a small part of her room. Here’s how she did it. (And if you’re curious, a list of her tech is at the end of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xvUDW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, tell us a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9mT50"&gt;I’m from Maryland, born and raised. I live outside of Annapolis, which is the capital of the state. I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year as a news writer and my one-year anniversary is coming up in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CejAAW"&gt;I am currently listed as a writer. “News” was dropped from my title, which primarily means that I place a lot more emphasis on service journalism. Basically, I find a lot of good deals for our readers so they can best spend the money that’s burning a hole in their pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaTko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4Jca"&gt;Yeah! My desk is in the same room as my bed, and it is close to my two-door closet. I previously had two other smaller desks instead of the one I currently have, but when it came to finding a new desk, I wanted something that was spacious yet also fit in the parameters I designated. A measuring tape was my best friend for sure! Funnily enough, I now have a 45-inch desk, but I could put a larger one in the space, and it wouldn’t feel cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlNgyqS9wvGUYCXjWGv8D01PshE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054931/tlyles_201111_4294_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyPcxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkUXHH"&gt;It’s a gaming desk by this company called Mr. Ironstone. In case it’s not obvious, I am a huge gamer, and I’ve always wanted to have a desk that was considered a “gaming desk.” I spent a few weeks researching a few different types of gaming desks, and eventually, I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-Computer-Headphone-Workstation/dp/B07HYTWJ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=12&amp;amp;imprToken=f2bbc3cd-6179-dec4-42c&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp=&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=3ddff728b756455213eb9564624e2d93&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Ironstone Gaming Desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbgoyO"&gt;A few people have said it’s minimal, but I am a very simple woman, and to be quite honest, a minimalist desk is the best because it provides you with more freedom and a ton of real estate to allow you to decorate your desk how you like. Shockingly, this is one of the cheapest desks I have used; it cost only $126 when I ordered it on Amazon. Ultimately, I decided to buy this desk because it came with a few neat things on the side (a cupholder and a headset hook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fDLJBG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g6i8oF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334240" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PFVwWH"&gt;
&lt;p id="3QMl94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the cupholder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsmjIm"&gt;The cupholder is one of my favorite parts of this desk! I did have a coaster and a headset mount on my old desk, but I did not like how they took up space on what was already a small desk to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3LZKb"&gt;The best part is that you can choose which side you put your headset hook and cupholder on. I chose to put the cupholder to my left because I am a lefty and my headset hook on the right because it is closer to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzS4tkUmNAaVLG0LxITuPhoAXh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054937/tlyles_201111_4294_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZcz_K4B2ydL9xRiRjqYYSGYrdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054901/tlyles_201113_4294_0032.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmLrJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really great-looking chair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91lqvl"&gt;It’s a Techni Sport TS-5000, and although it looks comfy, it’s actually very uncomfortable. I had to purchase a seat cushion because sitting on the chair for more than two hours made my butt hurt. I also have a weak back so, thankfully, I have cushions that provide extra comfort for my back and my butt, allowing me to work (or game) comfortably at my desk. I am planning to get a &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series"&gt;Secretlab Titan gaming chair&lt;/a&gt; soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PJ7Oyu"&gt;
&lt;div id="Mz1Qek"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334250" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EX3iY6"&gt;
&lt;p id="WSzKt3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. That’s quite a system you have there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjDPHQ"&gt;This is my gaming PC! Someone I knew gave me the case, and I bought and built the PC myself. I am currently in the process of upgrading my rig, but I want to point out a few things: the GPU I am using is an Asus RTX 3070, and my processor is an Intel Core i7-7700K. But within the next few months, I plan to switch my CPU and motherboard to AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFCzz"&gt;The biggest focus I had for my gaming PC was I wanted to make sure I could play the newest titles without having to sacrifice performance or graphics. I also try to plan 10 steps ahead in future-proofing my PC, especially with the new generation of gaming underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GkkRgYngyLbbLV0oxOMAGHn1R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22055628/tlyles_201113_4294_0012.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BciK0VTCzVIEd7OF3Si9SJBugU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054904/tlyles_201113_4294_0027.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf0oAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your displays? How did you decide on two, and how do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyWgRV"&gt;The gamer in me always wanted two displays. It also makes multitasking easier. Both monitors are 24 inches. The one on the right is an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-MG248QR-24-Full-HD-1ms-144Hz-DP-HDMI-FreeSync-Adaptive-Sync-Eye-Care-eSports-Gaming-Monitor%2F284736115%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=vergewhatsonyourdesktaylorlyle02122021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus MG248QR&lt;/a&gt;, the original one for my gaming PC, and the one on the left is newer, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545194-REG%2Fasus_vg258qr_24_5_wide_16_9_tn.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21572162%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VG258QR&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, I will upgrade to 4K monitors, but for now, these get the job done just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yZw48"&gt;My left monitor is the one I work on the most. The second one is what I use to keep my Slack app open. I split reading material on the right between two windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fvAKjj"&gt;
&lt;div id="pUynqv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9585116" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="g79X0e"&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4mIJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve admired your microphone setup ever since the first time I saw it. Tell us about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neY5Jy"&gt;Thank you! The microphone I am using is called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-QuadCast-Condenser-Microphone-Anti-Vibration/dp/B07NZZZ746?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=14&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s amazing! Previously, I had a few other mics, including a Blue Yeti. I chose the HyperX QuadCast as my new mic because I heard great things about the sound quality, and the design was also really intriguing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YoAWa"&gt;The QuadCast has a lot of bang for the buck, and I like how it comes with a stand for your mic and a shock mount in case you decide to place it on a boom arm, which is what I did. And it comes with a nice long cable, so you have more leverage for where to place it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yWVlT0"&gt;
&lt;div id="bob765"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306468" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NJOvOA"&gt;
&lt;p id="6No8CQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Adjustable-Suspension-T20/dp/B082W4B7SX?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=15&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boom arm I am using is from TONOR&lt;/a&gt;, and it is an adjustable suspension boom scissor mic stand that costs about $30. What’s great about this boom arm is that it includes a durable clamp, so if you have a heavier mic like, say, a Blue Yeti, it will be compatible with the boom arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1OEhl"&gt;You’ll also notice I have a pop filter on my mic. The QuadCast does have a built-in bright red pop filter, but unfortunately, it is not very good at stopping plosive speech sound. I didn’t want to use the “normal” pop filter, which came with the boom arm I bought, so I bought this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PEMOTech-Microphone-Windscreen-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01J5OTVTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=16&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=7bb6a56a87881b7dcbad0f42f71b18fa&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PEMOTech tri-layered pop filter&lt;/a&gt;. I bought it for $8, and aside from looking cool, it does help with the plosives. It gives off such a very professional look in my opinion that it makes me want to have a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNMmW-O6etQiEFpY9wxcWi5raf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054922/tlyles_201113_4294_0014.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EjdXWm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r28hpT"&gt;Most of the tech I use for my computer is from Logitech. I have a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fwebcams%2Fbrio-4k-hdr-webcam.960-001105.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21572162%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech BRIO webcam&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G635-DTS-Surround-LIGHTSYNC/dp/B07MH94CL5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=17&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G635 7.1 gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Spectrum-Mechanical-Keyboard-920-008012/dp/B01GAONOAC?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=18&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G910 RGB gaming keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Spectrum-Shifting-Personalized-Programmable/dp/B019OB663A?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=19&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIcFjV"&gt;The speakers you see hiding in the back are the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Chroma-Rear-Facing-Automatic/dp/B078H1T9YD?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=20&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Nommo Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, and I use those for listening to music or podcasts in the background while I work. That flight stick is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-3D-Pro-Joystick-Windows/dp/B00009OY9U?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=21&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Extreme 3D Pro Joystick&lt;/a&gt;, which I use exclusively to play &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; on my PC. The two controllers are for gaming: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Ultimate-Multi-Function-Intrchangeable-Thumbsticker/dp/B074RNL1RX?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=22&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; is for fighting games mostly, while I use the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732115940834051224" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Patrol Tech Special Edition Xbox One wireless controller&lt;/a&gt; for certain PC games (mostly platformers). Most of my PC gaming is done on my keyboard, but hey — never hurts to have some options, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7v2Mcx"&gt;
&lt;div id="HA0NmM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10340304" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KwUmg2"&gt;
&lt;p id="y126zh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk a little about your toys. Which are your favorites, and are there any interesting stories you’d like to share about any of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yg3RLz"&gt;I received the Rubik’s Cube as a gift from a friend a few years ago for my birthday. I know how to solve it, but I simply have not had the time. The fidget spinner is neat, too. Usually when I need a screen break, I just play with the fidget spinner a bit to relax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8eXfR1"&gt;I purchased the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/elago-AirPods-Compatible-Keychain-Registered/dp/B083LXTFXS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elago AW4 AirPods case&lt;/a&gt; because I was afraid I would misplace my pair of earbuds. Most of my family have these same earbuds, so I wanted to make sure that I could tell my case from the rest. It also looks really cute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KNRnR1Z0UR-McHr08vWZf5x8OJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054911/tlyles_201113_4294_0022.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIzqbMjmlUqPGLRXbIv9KRwWzJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054936/tlyles_201111_4294_0009.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUSFf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a wonderful banner you have hung up behind your desk! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHB9Bb"&gt;Aw, shucks. This was the thing I was really excited to share with you. I love collecting flags. I have about nine or 10 right now, but only four of them are hanging up at the moment. The one you see above my desk is the Maryland flag (aka the best state flag &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;). In case it’s not clear, I have a lot of state pride. I actually asked my mom to give me a Maryland flag as a high school graduation gift back in 2013, and it’s one of the handful of things that I consider my most prized possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOt6L5"&gt;I am sure you can see the American flag above my bed, too. I bought that one a year later when I was looking to redesign my room. I know some people will have their critiques of America as a whole, but I love being American, and I think our country has an incredible flag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are reportedly nervous about Nvidia acquiring Arm</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZVmi9"&gt;Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm have been raising concerns to regulators about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s Arm acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/qualcomm-objects-to-nvidias-40-billion-arm-acquisition.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition-kl2laz51?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The companies have approached regulators in the US, EU, UK, and China, reportedly with concerns that Nvidia could change how Arm licenses out its chipmaking technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qQhLk"&gt;Nvidia has pledged that it won’t use its control over the company to change how it interacts with other businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;Writing to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJiFld"&gt;Nvidia’s rivals argue, however, that keeping Arm neutral and not using its tech to Nvidia’s own gains isn’t what the company would be incentivized to do — especially not after paying $40 billion for it. Restrictions on licensing, however, would hurt the companies that benefit from having the ability to license Arm’s technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are reportedly working on their own Arm-based chips, and Qualcomm’s processors are based on the architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgnJuX"&gt;For its part, Nvidia has argued that the acquisition is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;about driving AI forward&lt;/a&gt;, which is an area Nvidia has focused on heavily, from its machine learning-powered upscaling on its graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300614/mercedes-benz-nvidia-computer-orin-self-driving-adas-ota"&gt;to its work in self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. Arm’s low-power technology could help Nvidia spread AI into more places, but the company will also have to figure out what to do with everything else Arm does — mainly, powering almost every cellphone in existence as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;holding the key to computer companies moving away from Intel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwKARN"&gt;Regulators are also apparently looking closely at the deal to determine whether it would give Nvidia too much power in the chipmaking business: according to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Federal Trade Commission has asked Nvidia and Arm to give it more information, and it could be talking to “other companies who may have relevant information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IT6z"&gt;Meanwhile, UK and EU officials &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;have promised to “thoroughly investigate”&lt;/a&gt; the deal. It’s very likely that they will hear many objections, not just from Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm, but from others in the chipmaking industry who are concerned about their open-licensing agreement with Arm being affected by the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLffgW"&gt;These companies have experience with regulators and anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm has had to pay several fines in the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars to authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-antitrust/south-korea-fines-qualcomm-854-million-for-violating-competition-laws-idUSKBN14H062"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16927042/qualcomm-apple-antitrust-chip-deal-eu-fine"&gt;the EU&lt;/a&gt; for anti-competitive licensing policies. Microsoft, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history"&gt;had its big monopoly case in the ‘90s&lt;/a&gt;, where it went up against the US government, and Google has recently been the focus of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust sentiment in the US&lt;/a&gt; and EU.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the Biden administration shot down his carbon tax pitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk visits construction site of the Tesla Giga Factory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHAe1mcHFt5URE24swmS4Uj0NhI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811124/1228323129.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Patrick Pleul / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMg73D"&gt;Elon Musk says he pitched the Biden administration on instituting a carbon tax as a way to encourage a faster shift to renewable energy, but he was told the idea was essentially “too politically difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4j7v3"&gt;Musk described the conversation with the Biden administration during &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2aB2swgyXqbFA06AxPlFmr?si=_8doDtUvSn-kkUNFE9Kp7w&amp;amp;nd=1"&gt;a new podcast with Joe Rogan that was released Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuMIU5"&gt;Rogan had asked Musk whether a new technological breakthrough is needed to increase the adoption of battery-powered vehicles. Musk argued the bigger issue is that “a hell of a lot of batteries [are] needed” in order to shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. The best way to encourage that shift, in Musk’s view, is to “put a price on carbon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="06as2e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t you just fight for that?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Zm0D4"&gt;“My top recommendation honestly would be just to have a carbon tax,” Musk said. “Because we’re not paying for the CO2 capacity of the oceans and atmosphere, we have what in economics is called an unpriced externality. The market is unable to respond to an unpriced externality. If we just put a price on it, the market will react in a sensible way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i53Q57"&gt;Musk suggested that consumers should pay the tax, and rebates could be offered to people who make lower incomes. A carbon tax could help further even the playing field for Tesla’s electric vehicles, though Musk said SpaceX (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22245363/spacex-texas-oil-company-drill-natural-gas-lone-star"&gt;currently trying to acquire natural gas wells in Texas to fuel its rockets&lt;/a&gt;) would have to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41WwFE"&gt;“I talked to the Biden administration, the incoming administration, and they were like, ‘Well, this seems too politically difficult,’” he said. Musk said he remembers thinking, “That’s at least half the reason you go elected, so why don’t you just fight for that?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDlexr"&gt;This isn’t the first time the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has agitated for a carbon tax. Musk reportedly floated the idea during early meetings with the Trump administration but got “little or no support,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-26/tesla-s-musk-said-to-float-idea-of-a-carbon-tax-to-trump-ceos"&gt;according to a 2017 report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjijUN"&gt;Musk has even &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/05/elon-musk-we-need-a-revolt-against-the-fossil-fuel-industry"&gt;previously called for a “revolt” against the fossil fuel industry&lt;/a&gt; while making the case for a carbon tax, and he &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-23/musk-suggests-big-oil-is-behind-critical-media-coverage-of-tesla"&gt;accused big oil companies of conspiring against Tesla&lt;/a&gt;. But he said on Rogan’s podcast that he is “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” because it would upset the people working in it, and also stopping its operations completely would mean everyone would “die of starvation, basically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOKstJ"&gt;“We’re gonna need to burn fossil fuels for a long time. The question is just at what rate do we move to a sustainable energy future?” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="yC1Vhs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk said he’s “not in favor of demonizing the oil and gas industry” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RqOrwW"&gt;“There are people who have spent their whole career in oil, and gas and they started out in that career when it didn’t seem like that bad of a thing to do. So then they’re like, ‘Hey man, I just spent my whole career working hard to do useful things, and now you’re telling me I’m the devil.’ That’s gonna make them pretty upset,” he said, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-elon-musk-oil-and-gas-industry-2020-9"&gt;echoing remarks from late last year&lt;/a&gt;. “Honestly the smartest thing the oil and gas industry could do is say, ‘Let’s do a carbon tax. We’ll just do a carbon tax, and it will make us not the devil.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwY20t"&gt;One of Biden’s main campaign planks was his support for an aggressive clean energy strategy. He committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;eliminating carbon pollution from the power sector by 2035&lt;/a&gt; and reaching a “100 percent clean energy economy” no later than 2050. He even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;voiced support for ending fossil fuel subsidies&lt;/a&gt;. And since taking office, he has recommitted the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;to the Paris climate accord&lt;/a&gt;. But he has not committed to a carbon tax, despite agitation from &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/biden-infrastructure-plan-carbon-tax.html"&gt;other business leaders close to the administration&lt;/a&gt; and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, who said &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/yellen-biden-carbon-pricing-energy-emissions-eee629c7-b4db-4f95-9d98-874269efdddd.html"&gt;the climate crisis can’t be solved without carbon pricing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra might have a tiny rear-facing display as a treat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rzry1JyEJDhay7pYddsSyxQ1QF4=/233x0:2633x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810744/screen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A YouTuber claims to have the unannounced Mi 11 Ultra featuring a 1-inch rear-facing screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ" target="_blank"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0lkk74"&gt;A YouTuber has posted a video featuring what he claims are two prototype Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra devices, suggesting the phone might have an unusual feature: a 1-inch rear-facing screen right next to the cameras. The video shows this small screen displaying what looks like an image of the phone’s home screen, only... you know, microscopic. A more practical application might be for selfies using the rear-facing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIr9WI"&gt;The video, since taken down, comes from a little-known Filipino vlogger who goes by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXm4cCkjikHqZYY5YUVY_GQ"&gt;Tech Buff PH&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/xiaomi-11-ultra-leak-120x-zoom-secondary-screen/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; the device model number checks out, and certain details align with previous leaks. Other details from this alleged leak include 67W fast wireless charging, a 6.8-inch curved OLED with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, a 5,000mAh battery, and IP68 water and dust resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OHZ7Z5MDhlVBwSfjD6KkPn5m6QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300240/cameras.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tech Buff PH&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device shows three cameras, including a periscope-style lens with 120x hybrid zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7iJtUE"&gt;The alleged devices include a huge camera bump with a 120x hybrid zoom camera, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a 50-megapixel main camera. If this phone is indeed the Mi 11 Ultra, then it looks like Xiaomi ditched the 2x telephoto lens on the previous model, offering just the longer periscope-style zoom lens instead. There’s also a 12mm ultrawide, which Tech Buff PH claims has a 48-megapixel sensor, upgraded from 12 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bseVcE"&gt;Xiaomi announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Chinese variant&lt;/a&gt; of the standard Mi 11 at the end of 2020, and more recently, it unveiled an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272003/xiaomi-mi-11-international-price-release-date-announcement"&gt;international version&lt;/a&gt;. Both feature a top-of-the-line Snapdragon 888 processor offering 5G connectivity. With those versions announced, Xiaomi will likely follow with other variants such as the alleged Ultra version featured here. Whether this device will shape up to be the real deal remains to be seen, but it’s an interesting concept to consider in either case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s $329 RTX 3060 graphics card is launching on February 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHFJDDfAxVVuOMjFuruygt6xecM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810679/acastro_180529_1777_nvidia_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S1ooUb"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Nvidia was making a $329 RTX 3060 graphics card&lt;/a&gt;, and today, the company announced that it will make its most affordable GPU in the RTX 3000 series available at retailers beginning on February 25th. Retailers will open orders for the RTX 3060 starting at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Nvidia tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will not be creating a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060 graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fstpRG"&gt;Designed to succeed the aging GeForce GTX 1060 Pascal cards, the RTX 3060 features 12GB of GDDR6 memory. Like the other products featured in the RTX 3000 series, the RTX 3060 will also support DLSS and Nvidia’s suite of RTX applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qXPsa"&gt;With a new RTX 30 card coming later this month, we anticipate that the RTX 3060 GPU will sell out &lt;em&gt;quickly&lt;/em&gt;. These cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228470/nvidia-evga-zotac-raise-prices-rtx-3080-3070-3060-3090"&gt;have been difficult to purchase&lt;/a&gt; since last fall when the RTX 30 series first debuted. In January, Nvidia said it anticipates supply for its GPUs to both consumers and partners “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;will likely remain lean through Q1&lt;/a&gt;,” which doesn’t end until late April. To alleviate the short supply and sky-high prices, Nvidia confirmed yesterday that it plans to bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278562/nvidia-rtx-2060-gtx-1050-ti-gpu-shortage-global-chip"&gt;back its older RTX 2060 and GTX 1050 Ti graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wzhgrz"&gt;Apple is gearing up for the release of &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; season 2 on Apple TV Plus. It’s kicking things off with a new augmented reality app, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F02%2Ffor-all-mankind-time-capsule-a-new-augmented-reality-experience-based-on-the-apple-tv-space-drama-is-available-today-in-the-app-store%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22278780%2Fapple-augmented-reality-ar-app-for-all-mankind-tv-plus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule&lt;/a&gt;, that looks to fill in the gap between the two seasons using AR artifacts from the world of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYaejE"&gt;The app itself is a fun promotional gimmick to help promote the second season of one of Apple’s higher-profile original shows. It’s the broader strategy at play that’s interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-A2SPv3VJ5iEzKRt16P48rg6ZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22300211/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_11.53.26_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JJNJeK"&gt;It’s no secret that Apple is interested in AR. The recurring AR demos at the last several iPhone and iPad product announcements, the addition of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185200/apple-ipad-pro-lidar-sensor-ar-hardware-solution-software-apps-augmented-reality"&gt;AR-focused LIDAR cameras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"&gt;latest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524288/apple-iphone-12-pro-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Pro devices&lt;/a&gt;, and the persistent rumors of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;pending VR / AR headsets&lt;/a&gt; are all clear evidence of that. And Apple has been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-26/apple-plans-augmented-reality-content-to-boost-tv-video-service?sref=9hGJlFio"&gt;rumored to be working&lt;/a&gt; on the tie-in app for a while now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bcDepD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s rumored VR headset could cost $3,000, feature 8K displays and over a dozen cameras","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7Jd0Y0"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;: Time Capsule is one of the first indications of Apple tying all of its hardware, content, and service ambitions together. It’s an augmented reality app downloaded from the App Store that prompts users to subscribe to Apple TV Plus to watch &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, with additional content for LIDAR-equipped Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ChQU3"&gt;It’s the kind of cross-promotional content that spans Apple’s wide array of businesses. It could also offer a glimpse at the kind of integrated hardware, software, and service bundle that Apple could be considering for any future AR devices. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex and the City is now available in HD for the first time on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAnpitTvj8WmQx7KLbDDvFRfW-8=/60x0:708x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810387/cq5dam.web.768.432.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v5P22e"&gt;A newly remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; is now available to stream on &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced on Friday. Thanks to the remaster, you can watch the hit show in a high-definition 16:9 aspect ratio for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enIPUF"&gt;“The series was originally shot on film and mastered in standard definition as high definition capabilities were unavailable at the time of filming,” &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/media-release/newly-remastered-hd-version-sex-and-city-now-available-hbo-max"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Over the past year, the series was updated from scratch as film negatives from the show were meticulously scanned at 4K to create HD masters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIPndy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wQN-uyEyuwY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JfZzgH"&gt;The new HD remasters arrive ahead of a “new chapter” of &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; coming to &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=SexCityHD021221"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, called “And Just Like That...” Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis are set to reprise their roles as Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte, but playing the characters in their 50s. WarnerMedia has already given the series a &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/sarah-jessica-parker-cynthia-nixon-and-kristin-davis-star-max-original-series-and?language_content_entity=en"&gt;10-episode order&lt;/a&gt; and says it will begin production in New York City this spring.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s new Mario-themed Switch is available now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bvgRQTxM0NLQWTBSTeifLDgYgTM=/486x0:5736x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68808878/SM3DW_Lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo Switch Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QwoMeU"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-3D-World-Bowsers-Fury/dp/B08H9M7LDY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, several retailers have a Mario Red &amp;amp; Blue Edition Switch game console available for purchase. You can buy one right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Mario-Red-Blue/dp/B08M8YQMH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732041273955221131" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-and-blue-edition%2F11114028.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-mario-red-38-blue-edition%2F-%2FA-82242753%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGb5kj"&gt;Similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/30/21116081/nintendo-animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-unique-joy-con-colors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;-themed Switch released last year&lt;/a&gt;, this limited-edition console stands out from other models, with the entire Switch and its accompanying accessories based on the outfit typically worn by the mustached plumber. Retailing for $300, the limited-edition Switch features an all-red console, a red dock stand, a pair of red Joy-Cons, a red casing around the screen, and a blue Joy-Con grip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AvudIO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10338949"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1HC5Y2"&gt;Additionally, for $300, the Mario-themed Switch also includes a screen protector and a special carrying case that includes various symbols associated with the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; franchise at no additional cost. The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;, which includes two more hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg2C5x"&gt;If you are planning to buy this console, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, the device does not include a copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;, despite both products having the same release date. Secondly, these limited-edition Nintendo Switch consoles tend to sell out quickly, and there’s no telling if and when it will be restocked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read about how Facebook’s pseudo-Supreme Court came together</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SlEdJ2Wf8bxr1drFgmpaP9VOtnY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810210/VRG_ILLO_4033_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Andrew Caballero-Reynolds / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qfiutq"&gt;Can Facebook meaningfully have a Supreme Court?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSUolY"&gt;The title of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Ftech%2Fannals-of-technology%2Finside-the-making-of-facebooks-supreme-court&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22280003%2Ffacebook-oversight-board-supreme-court-feature-new-yorker#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new feature in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;written by law professor Kate Klonick, implies that the answer is &lt;em&gt;yes&lt;/em&gt;. The story is more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGpKKX"&gt;The feature is called “Inside the making of Facebook’s Supreme Court,” and it’s an unprecedentedly detailed look at the Facebook Oversight Board, a Facebook-funded semi-independent panel that can overrule Facebook takedown decisions. The Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;launched in October&lt;/a&gt;, and it issued its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first decisions in January&lt;/a&gt;, saying Facebook had made the wrong call on four removed posts. In the coming months, it will make its highest-profile decision to date: whether Facebook should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;restore the account&lt;/a&gt; of former president Donald Trump. But as Klonick lays out, its actual power is complex and contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C5dFK6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees worried a powerful court could accidentally kill Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hHWm0"&gt;Klonick writes candidly about months of heated debate over how the Oversight Board should function. Internally, Facebook employees worried that if the board could write policy, it might make a decision that destroyed Facebook: what if, one person speculated, it told Facebook to get rid of the News Feed? Externally, it faced pressure from conservative politicians. One group reportedly asked Facebook to add Trump’s children to the Oversight Board, and when the members were announced, Trump apparently called CEO Mark Zuckerberg to rail against them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2P2nXp"&gt;But the biggest power struggle in the story isn’t any individual policy decision; it’s the protracted attempt to legitimize a Facebook quasi-government. Interestingly, Klonick &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Klonick/status/1360257727671468032"&gt;mentioned on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook “hated” the Supreme Court framing — even if “that’s how the public thinks of it.” But Zuckerberg &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17187974/mark-zuckerberg-community-content-removal-appeal-vox-interview"&gt;mused about a system&lt;/a&gt; “like a Supreme Court” in 2018, and Klonick notes that the board’s charter was referred to internally as a “constitution.” In perhaps the story’s funniest detail, members “used pens topped with a feather, to evoke the quills used by the Founding Fathers.” (Sadly, “topped” implies they wouldn’t commit to &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; quill pens.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50iwJQ"&gt;Parts of the story’s framing have drawn objections from some critics and legal scholars. After all, the board doesn’t have formal legal power — it exists because Facebook is voluntarily abiding by its rules. “Facebook and others have been appropriating legal/civic language and frameworks from the beginning. It has always, ALWAYS been about declaring legitimacy,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jwherrman/status/1360247786197901313"&gt;tweeted &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; John Herrman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OrNT79"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Should we use the language of government for Facebook?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPc2EG"&gt;That legitimacy comes partly from Facebook’s ability to pull critics into its orbit. Knight First Amendment Institute director Jameel Jaffer tells Klonick he turned down a spot on the board, and he’s anxious that Facebook is “co-opting” people who might push for change from the outside. Journalist and professor Zeynep Tufekci &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1360249282645929985"&gt;notes that&lt;/a&gt; the Oversight Board could meaningfully improve moderation, but “it is being rolled out BY FACEBOOK as part of a PR push, with Facebook trying to elbow it into a position where we treat it as a ‘Supreme Court’ despite the obvious.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKAsYR"&gt;The Trump case will put the Oversight Board and its limitations in the spotlight. (The Knight Institute has asked it to delay the decision &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/content/facebook-oversight-board-should-delay-ruling-on-suspension-of-trump-knight-institute-says"&gt;for an outside review&lt;/a&gt;.) And it will do so as Congress looks at whether to regulate Facebook the old-fashioned way — with a government the social giant &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; build.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Notion was having technical issues, so I have no idea what my schedule is today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3IReCnAx8bGX_0yMHSZ0T1y1mc=/0x62:1000x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68810108/akrales_180824_2908_0071_squ.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;This shows what Notion looks like when it is working | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZBKAre"&gt;Online organization app Notion was experiencing technical difficulties this morning and students, project managers, and other users — like me — who rely on it to organize our calendars were having minor freak-outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20MJIG"&gt;The company said in a tweet around 8:30AM ET that it was “experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users.” The company didn’t provide much additional detail, but some speculated that it may have to do with Notion’s web address: notion.so. The “so” suffix is the domain for the country of Somalia, and a deleted tweet from Notion asked if anyone knew people in Somalia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iC4zji"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're experiencing a DNS issue, causing the site to not resolve for many users. We are actively looking into this issue.&lt;/p&gt;— Notion Status (@NotionStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360220589743480838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wuDIdy"&gt;The app is mainly used as a workplace collaboration tool, but it has become popular among casual users — including teens on TikTok, who use it to organize their class schedules. Users complaining about not being able to access Notion on Friday morning suggested now might be the time for the company, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/04/01/notion-hits-2-billion-valuation-in-new-raise/"&gt;valued at $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020, to make offline access a priority in future versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="513mQB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok teens’ latest passion is enterprise software","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215782/tiktok-notion-enterprise-software-teen-studyblr"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3TqG3z"&gt;Around 11AM ET, the company said the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NotionStatus/status/1360257098781659137?s=20"&gt;DNS issue was resolved&lt;/a&gt; and users should begin to see service restored. The company confirmed it was putting protections in place to prevent future issues in an emailed statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tRBvd6"&gt;The reason for the downtime this morning was a very unusual DNS issue that occurred at the registry operator level. Our engineers jumped on it immediately and resolved the issue - we’re back up now. We’re in touch with the registry operator and registrar putting protocols in place so that we can avoid this type of incident from repeating in the future. This was a very rare chain of events to occur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLnDQ"&gt;Eventually my Notion page came back to normal as well. But if I’m late to a Zoom meeting today, sorry, boss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8sgJo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 2:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds that Notion pages appear to be functioning normally again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOx9X7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTHLcX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z9Ulx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
