    <title>Samsung Galaxy A52 5G review: a midrange phone that will last</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not the cheapest budget phone, but it will go the distance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q8E5E4"&gt;If a $100 budget phone is the fast-food dollar menu and a $1,000 flagship is a steakhouse dinner, then the Samsung Galaxy A52 5G sits comfortably halfway between the two: the laid-back all-day cafe with surprisingly tasty food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6762Rt"&gt;It’s good. More importantly, it’s good where it matters. Sure, you have to order your food at the counter and get your own water refills, but it’s worth it because brunch is fantastic and the prices are reasonable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frUf4o"&gt;The A52 5G is the highest-specced of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370189/samsung-galaxy-a52-a42-a32-5g-a12-a02s-price-specs-price"&gt;budget A-series Galaxy phones&lt;/a&gt; we’ll see in the US this year, offering all of the basics for its $499 price tag along with a few good extras. Its 6.5-inch screen comes with a fast 120Hz refresh rate that’s scarce at this price point. Its main camera includes optical image stabilization, something I missed when I used the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;more expensive OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;. The A52 5G is rated IP67 waterproof for some extra peace of mind. And hey, there’s still a headphone jack! In this economy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CbrcLy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10462503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4ql9c"&gt;Still, this isn’t a flagship, and costs had to be cut somewhere. The device’s frame and back panel are plastic, and while I like the matte finish on the back, there’s a certain hollowness when you tap on it that’s not very reassuring. There’s also no telephoto to complement the wide and ultrawide cameras, just digital zoom plus a depth sensor and macro camera of dubious usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHb7bt"&gt;The important stuff is here, though. Samsung has the A52 5G on its list for monthly OS updates currently, and it says it will offer three years of major Android OS updates and at least some security support for four years. That will go a long way toward making the most out of your investment in this phone, and it will help you take advantage of its headline feature: 5G — Sub-6GHz, specifically, with hardware-level support for the C-band frequencies carriers will start using in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ags8Hc"&gt;It’s getting more common to see 5G offered in midrange and budget phones, but in this country, it’ll be a couple more years before our 5G networks are truly good. Healthy device support for the next few years makes it more likely that the A52 5G will actually last long enough to make it to that 5G promised land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N1lu981XZQQIMuwY7AbVUo_HWFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465665/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A52 5G offers solid everyday performance with a Snapdragon 750G chipset and 6GB of RAM.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vTC01h"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G performance and screen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xBcTmE"&gt;The A52 5G uses a Snapdragon 750G processor with 6GB of RAM, and the combination feels like a good fit here. You can certainly push it out of its comfort zone with heavier tasks like webpages with JavaScript, and I noticed it hesitating a moment too long when opening the camera app from the lock screen. But for day-to-day tasks and social media scrolling, it keeps up well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHF1lS"&gt;As in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;last year’s model&lt;/a&gt;, the screen is where the A52 5G (and Samsung generally) really stand out. This is a 6.5-inch 1080p OLED panel that’s rich, bright, and generally lovely to look at. Plus, it offers all of the velvety smoothness that comes with its 120Hz refresh rate. Swiping between home screens, opening apps, scrolling through Twitter — it all just feels nicer with a fast refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TlJgv3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WXx6D"&gt;Even considering the additional power needed for the 120Hz screen, the A52 5G’s 4,500mAh battery consistently lasted well into the next day in my use. I managed to get two full days out of it when I forgot to charge it overnight and decided to embrace chaos and just plow through on the remaining charge. This was with light to moderate use, and I was down to low double-digit battery percentage by the end of day two, but my gamble paid off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvn5CE"&gt;One feature I continue to fight a losing battle with on the A52 5G is the in-display optical fingerprint sensor. I’ve been chastised by the phone many times for not leaving my finger on the sensor long enough, and I almost always need at least two tries to get it to register. That hit rate goes down significantly outside in bright light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gO7BU8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3s0y6"&gt;These problems aren’t unique to this device, and you can just opt to use (less secure) facial recognition or a plain old PIN to lock and unlock the phone. But there are nicer in-display fingerprint readers in pricier phones like the OnePlus 9 and Samsung’s own S21, so it’s a trade-off to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk5IWZ"&gt;The Galaxy A52 5G ships with Android 11, which is great. The less good news is, as we saw in the S21 devices earlier this year, Samsung’s latest take on the OS stuffs a lot of unwanted apps, ads, and general clutter into the UI. I see enough ads throughout my day as it is, and I do not appreciate seeing one more when I check the weather on my phone’s own weather app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPpfpU"&gt;If there’s a positive way to look at this situation, it’s that it feels more forgivable on a budget phone than on a $1,000-plus flagship. But I’d rather not have the ads at all. If you buy the similarly priced Pixel 4A 5G, you give up a lot of other features from the A52 5G, but you get an ad-free experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZhUR-qGtJB0ABj4ns-AbLqIMuEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465664/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Housed in the rear camera bump are a standard wide, ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HaqLe9"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TGVjuj"&gt;The A52 5G includes three rear cameras, plus a 5-megapixel depth sensor. You get a 64-megapixel standard wide with OIS, 12-megapixel ultrawide, and the seemingly obligatory 5-megapixel macro camera. There’s also a front-facing 32-megapixel selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1n9yk3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10462184"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LfMrMu"&gt;The 64-megapixel main camera produces 16-megapixel images in its standard photo mode that are bright with the very saturated colors you’d expect from a Samsung phone. Sometimes the look is pleasant, but more often than not, it’s a little much for my taste. The good news is that this sensor is capable of capturing lots of fine detail in good lighting, and it even does well in dim to very low-light conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmGCNi"&gt;I put its night mode up against the Google Pixel 4A, which is still the low-light champ in the midrange class. There’s more noise visible in the A52 5G’s night mode shot, and details have a watercolory look, but while the 4A hangs on to its title, the A52 5G is quite close behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="muSVAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462353"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fL9uTL"&gt;The Pixel 4A is still the better camera in good lighting, too, but the differences are more subjective here. The 4A goes for more subdued color rendering, and the A52 5G’s images lack a little contrast in comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2waOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10462360"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEZCg3"&gt;So the A52 5G can’t beat the generation-old imaging tech in the 4A, but that might say more about the Pixel than anything else. Aside from that, the A52 5G turns in good all-around camera performance. Images from the ultrawide sometimes have a little cooler color cast but are generally good. The selfie camera offers two zoom settings: a slightly cropped-in standard wide view and an ever-so-slightly wider angle. The “focal length” difference between the two is almost laughably small. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4meBPd"&gt;At its default settings, the selfie camera does a fair amount of face smoothing and brightening. I don’t think it quite crosses the line into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;hamcam territory&lt;/a&gt;, but it certainly has that telltale “maybe it’s AI, maybe it’s Maybelline” smoothed look to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhpTk3"&gt;If you want to go full hamcam, there’s a new mode just labeled “fun” in the camera app with AR face filters brought to you by Snapchat. There’s a different selection of them every day, and you don’t need a Snapchat account to use or share them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rqpRt"&gt;I’m tempted to dismiss them as “for the youths,” but maybe this is really for the olds like me who would rather not join another social platform if I can possibly avoid it, thank you very much. At last, I can transform my face into a piece of broccoli and share it with the world without logging in to Snapchat — three years after the kids have all moved on to something else. Anyway, it’s there, it works, and you can indeed turn your face into broccoli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1oKBK3JdgYUcwZh5b6fILyiLJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465662/ajohnson_20210419_4541_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good hardware and healthy software support make the A52 5G worth spending a little more on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8blwo0"&gt;There’s a lot that the Galaxy A52 5G gets right. Maybe the most important feature is one that sounds much less exciting than cool headline specs: security updates for at least the next few years. At $500, this is the higher end of the budget market, but a few extra hundred dollars is likely easier to swallow if you know you’ll get a couple more years out of your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxfsaW"&gt;Samsung has invested in hardware in all the right places: the 120Hz screen makes for an elevated user experience, battery life is good, camera performance is strong, and a healthy processor / chipset combination handles daily tasks well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVgjzT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52 5G is a good midrange phone today — but just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fXjffS"&gt;What I didn’t love — the cluttered software, fussy fingerprint sensor, a tendency toward oversaturated color in photos — feels more forgivable when the phone gets the nonnegotiable stuff right. The Pixel 4A 5G is probably this device’s closest competition, and it beats the A52 5G on camera quality and a cleaner UI, but it’s a smaller device without a fancy fast refresh rate screen. Depending on how you feel about either of those things, the 4A 5G might be the better pick for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="w7Ybue"&gt;In any case, the A52 5G is a good midrange phone today. But just as importantly, it will be a good phone a few years from now. With solid hardware and a software support system to back it up, this is a pricier budget phone that’s worth budgeting a little extra for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get a load of this week’s best tech deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TCL Alto 8 Plus " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tHvFjNCstH092eC60eC4cM1x_NY=/0x0:1041x694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180108/altohed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL’s Alto 8 Plus soundbar | TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FgFSwe"&gt;It’s the weekend, so that’s our cue to fire off this handy list of the best tech deals we’ve laid eyes on over the past few days. There weren’t many big surprise price drops, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t some great pieces of tech to buy. This week’s best deals are for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible. There’s a discount on a feature-packed soundbar for under $100, and Google’s Pixel 3 that has a solid camera is just $170. Plus, there are some more gaming deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E0Y3R"&gt;Have a nice weekend!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KmGms5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CJn9s7"&gt;Save on this capable yet affordable TCL soundbar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XQEtEr"&gt;TCL might be known more for its TVs than soundbars, but we still think this deal from Woot is worth sharing. The TCL Alto 8 Plus, which has both a subwoofer and Amazon’s Fire TV 4K streaming hardware built in, is just $70 new at Woot. It has a one-year warranty through TCL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uWsvjm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hVZ6T4"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ayf3NN"&gt;Google’s compact Pixel 3 is just $170 at Woot and Daily Steals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bEXUTb"&gt;If you’re looking for a phone that doesn’t cost too much money but also doesn’t compromise on camera quality, check out this deal. The Pixel 3 is available at Woot and Daily Steals for $170. At Woot, you don’t need an offer code. But if you’re shopping through Daily Steals, you’ll need to enter the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEPXLE &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kGaOLG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yDbwUM"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="picMwV"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 Pro is more affordable than ever&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Rve4TR"&gt;GameStop’s Pro Day sale has the best discount we’ve seen yet for the Razer DeathAdder V2 Pro wireless gaming mouse. It’s normally $130, but you can snag it today, April 24th, for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="riz8XG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736462"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8qozOs"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1i1fWK"&gt;Get Cyberpunk 2077 for $40 at GameStop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGRUIM"&gt;Joke all you want about Cyberpunk 2077’s disastrous launch, there’s still a lot of solid gameplay to enjoy here. If you own an Xbox Series X or PS5, you’ll certainly have a better, smoother experience than those who still have an Xbox One or PS4. Get this game for $40 during GameStop’s Pro Day sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XBfJ7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="EfhSO1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>SpaceX capsule with four astronauts on board docks with the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX Crew-2 Mission Launches From Cape Canaveral" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eP94C-MjH1IpdC1HZ7WLkpJWbFQ=/384x0:4902x3012/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69180071/1232476519.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joel Kowsky/NASA via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lheOYH"&gt;A SpaceX Crew Dragon spacecraft with four astronauts aboard successfully docked with the International Space Station early Saturday to start its six-month mission, &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/crew-2/2021/04/24/spacex-crew-2-astronauts-join-station-crew/"&gt;NASA announced&lt;/a&gt;. Crew-2, as it’s been dubbed, is SpaceX’s third astronaut mission under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. It brings NASA’s Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur, Akihiko Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and Thomas Pesquet, a French aerospace engineer from the European Space Agency (ESA) to the ISS, which travels at more than 17,000 miles per hour in orbit roughly 250 miles above Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niO07n"&gt;A Falcon 9 rocket which was used for SpaceX’s Crew-1 mission in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;launched early Friday&lt;/a&gt; for its 24-hour trip to the ISS. The Falcon 9 carried Endeavour, the same Crew Dragon capsule that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;launched SpaceX’s debut astronaut mission last year&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="liVW9c"&gt;The four astronauts were welcomed aboard the ISS shortly before 8AM ET by the Expedition 65 crew of Shannon Walker, Michael Hopkins, Victor Glover, and Mark Vande Hei of NASA, as well as Soichi Noguchi of JAXA and Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nLAM2P"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Endeavour arriving!" Welcome to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Space_Station?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Space_Station&lt;/a&gt;, Crew-2! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their arrival means there are now 11 humans aboard our orbiting laboratory, a number not seen since the space shuttle era. Hugs abound. &lt;a href="https://t.co/uSwW3JFl6K"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uSwW3JFl6K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA (@NASA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1385923550738100228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDVKxF"&gt;Kimbrough, McArthur, Hoshide, and Pesquet will now spend six months in space conducting &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/crew-2-microgravity-science-space-station"&gt;science experiments&lt;/a&gt;, including a focus on “&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/tissue-chips"&gt;tissue chips&lt;/a&gt;,” which NASA describes as “small models of human organs containing multiple cell types that behave much the same as they do in the body.” The chips may help identify drugs or vaccines more quickly than the current processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gg3kWN"&gt;The mission marks the first time SpaceX has reused a craft for a crewed mission. SpaceX has launched and reused several Falcon 9 rockets and uncrewed Dragon capsules as part of an initiative to save time and money on space exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaNObR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmIlgH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Flex 3 Chromebook review: good price, bad screen</title>

  &lt;p&gt;If you squint, it’s a good laptop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mJpAgB"&gt;Lenovo’s Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook is one of the tiniest Chromebooks I’ve ever used. It’s also one of the cheapest, retailing for just $349.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSaYIO"&gt;Any laptop that costs that little is going to have some serious drawbacks — and the Flex 3 certainly does. On the other hand, if you’re the sort of shopper who’s willing to set those aside, this little IdeaPad also has a number of pleasant surprises up its sleeve. There are even a few areas (in particular, the battery life) where it gives significantly more expensive devices a run for their money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="IoI416"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10462824"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="983yJe"&gt;I’ll start with the pleasant surprises. The Flex 3 offers a more modern port selection than I’d expect at its price point — there are two USB 3.1 Type-C Gen 1 ports and two USB 3.1 Type-A Gen 1 ports (one on each side, which is really handy for charging and connecting accessories), as well as a microSD reader, an audio combo jack, and a lock slot. There’s a 720p webcam that works decently well if you’re not in low light. And the touchpad is surprisingly sturdy — I often find that touchpads in this price range feel plasticky. The Flex even comes with a Google Security H1 chip, which encrypts sensitive on-device data.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook sits open on a table in front of two houseplants. The screen displays the upper windows of a large building." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjAXXv269bHXVJp5D5GcMXbzyh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465928/mchin_20190715_4544_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a power button on the side, as well as a volume rocker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ctkol8"&gt;There are two features that really impressed me (in addition to the battery life, which I’ll discuss later on). First, I can’t stop talking about the keyboard. It’s great, with tons of travel and a satisfying click. The keys have a slightly rough texture that really grew on me. I got one of the highest scores I’ve ever gotten on my usual typing test, with almost no errors. The only note is that it lacks backlighting, a feature you’ll find on more expensive devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt; (our current top Chromebook pick) and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FIdeaPad-F5-CB-13CML-05%2Fp%2F88IPFC51448&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22400085%2Flenovo-ideapad-flex-3-chromebook-review-price-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2pw40tT5NaVBOgqkSG-hFJguNHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465938/mchin_20190715_4544_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;God, I love a good keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ib8FQC"&gt;Second, audio. The balance and volume that these 2W stereo speakers deliver are on par with those of any number of more expensive Chromebooks. They easily beat the Spin 713, which sounds tinny and thin. There are caveats, of course: There’s very little bass, percussion is weak, I heard a bit of distortion at max volume, and you’ll want an external speaker for any crowded setting. But the Flex is great for video conferences and regular music-listening, and certainly beats what I’ve heard from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368806/msi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7"&gt;all kinds of Windows laptops&lt;/a&gt; that are over $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrS84j"&gt;Now, for the major drawbacks. First, this thing is a clunker. It’s not too heavy, at 2.65 pounds, but it’s 0.7 inches thick, and it’s not too far from the size of many modern 13-inch laptops despite having just an 11-inch screen. My main turnoff, though, is the bezels. Good lord, the bezels are enormous. When I’m using the Flex 3, I feel like I’m looking at a small window of screen floating in an abyss of black. It looks like a device you’d have bought in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook open from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ILkVWQvleiFgAepA9jHh_U2eYy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465929/mchin_20190715_4544_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish Lenovo had sprung for a better screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook from the left side, half open on a table in front of two houseplants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6OJ9zjZpOm0K4KITiX_1FrxwJuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465931/mchin_20190715_4544_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the Flex 3 in laptop tent, stand, or tablet modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook closed from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Kb6kKtGBaLeXd46bXenxUVpVUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465932/mchin_20190715_4544_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is from the other side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8q4kL"&gt;I do like some things about the chassis, though. It doesn’t feel at all flimsy, with an aluminum cover and a non-plasticky finish. The display and keyboard are free of flex (despite the laptop’s name). And the 360 hinge is sturdy, with very little wobble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="E5IDM2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462832"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RM0LtC"&gt;Speaking of the display, though: That’s the second major drawback here. It’s cramped — I often use two windows side-by-side and I’ve been squinting at tiny text in order to make that work on the Flex 3. Moreover, it’s dim (maxing out at 250 nits), kicks back a ton of glare even indoors, and is quite low-resolution (1366 x 768). I’m gonna be real: It’s pixel-y to look at. I’ve been using the Flex 3 as my primary driver for a week, and while I will miss the keyboard and audio when I send it back, I can’t wait never to have to look at this terrible screen again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77uXF3"&gt;That’s the lowdown on the chassis — let’s look inside. This Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook configuration is powered by Intel’s dual-core Celeron N4020. That’s the bottom of the barrel as Intel processors go, and it comes with just 4GB of memory (LPDDR4-2400, soldered) and 64GB of eMMC 5.1 storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNLDff"&gt;On a Windows machine, these specs would be a hard pass. But Chrome OS is a lighter load, and I can vouch that the Flex 3’s screen is a bigger limit on multitasking than its horsepower is. I was &lt;em&gt;able &lt;/em&gt;to use the laptop for a substantial workload, jumping between dozens of Chrome tabs and some apps, but the experience was cramped enough that I wouldn’t recommend it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook open, seen from the back, angled slightly to the right, on a table in front of two houseplants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KpKqNTq7XHlcBJ_EH2hKOz6yJVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465933/mchin_20190715_4544_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The color is called “almond”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rvio6t"&gt;Scrolling got a bit sluggish when I tried to work on top of a Spotify or YouTube stream, and the transitions between laptop and tablet mode were a bit slower than I would’ve liked. The only task where I ran into real trouble, though, was sorting through a batch of shots in Google Photos (with a couple other apps running on the side). The Flex 3 did get the job done, but it was quite slow. The one Zoom meeting I tried (on top of some other tabs I needed) was also a bad experience — audio randomly cut out a couple times, and video was stuttery throughout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBJKQV"&gt;Overall, this device is best if you’re looking to do basic office or school tasks, and don’t think you’ll need to have more than a few things open at a time. (And in case this doesn’t go without saying, you’ll want to stay far away from this thing if you plan on doing anything fancy with Linux.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DctQbr"&gt;The flipside of the weak processor is that the Flex 3 has excellent battery life. I averaged eight hours and 45 minutes to a charge with brightness at 50 percent — and I was pushing the thing harder than most people probably will be, as noted above. You can expect that this thing will last all day, and certainly longer than many more powerful Chromebooks. The 45W charger is acceptably quick, juicing the device up to 60 percent in 52 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook laid flat on a wooden table, seen from above, angled slightly to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rf1F4Xqkb01JrMUPcSDbk5q3OBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465934/mchin_20190715_4544_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Six rows of keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="duyeAB"&gt;The Flex 3 runs Chrome OS, which means it can run Android apps natively. Some of these have improved since the last time I used this operating system — Messenger is now functional and no longer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;complete disaster&lt;/a&gt; that bricks the machine, for example. But most of the services I use daily (Slack, Twitter, Gmail, Reddit, etc.) are just better experiences in a browser, so I didn’t use the dedicated app functionality all that often. There’s also still a double-notification problem — every time I got a Slack message, I got a notification both from the Slack Android app and my browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4hEib"&gt;The Flex 3 also supports Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which has gotten quite good. It supports Android-esque gesture controls, which should help flatten the learning curve for new Chromebook users (though they were a bit sluggish on this device). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 in tent mode, seen from the left side, with two houseplants in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kn6oIEiweo0HPg46e6_yyLnBnu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465935/mchin_20190715_4544_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flex 3 feels pretty sturdy in tent mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo Ideapad Flex 3 Chromebook in tent mode, with the screen facing the camera, angled slightly to the left, sits on a table with two houseplants in the background. The screen displays a grid of Chrome OS app icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lxyygOXcli5WNi4e6dx_N9Nmfj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465937/mchin_20190715_4544_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Took a hot second to switch to tablet mode, but it got there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="sz9z5G"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q5sYgc"&gt;Deciding whether to buy a $350 Chromebook comes down to understanding what the big drawbacks are. In this case, there are two: The screen is cramped, and the processor is weak. So the question to ask is: Given those caveats, can you get your stuff done? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cID626"&gt;If you’re just using this device to pay bills, email people, and run some YouTube videos, I would say you can. It’ll be a little cramped, but you can. And if you can stomach that, the Flex 3 does deliver some great benefits in other areas, from the great keyboard and convenient ports to the outstanding battery life and respectable audio. In these categories, it rivals or surpasses our top Chromebook pick (the Spin 713). If you’re okay with its flaws, you’ll find that the Flex 3 offers quite a bit for its budget price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Guacamole may be premature, but it sounds ripe to become an Android feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chef Todd Hall Alive And Cooking" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y21RpXP6WOPoPcGBl39SODG9c6E=/0x408:4638x3500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178862/456804252.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Pat Greenhouse/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgiIuq"&gt;Google probably wasn’t planning to reveal this until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;the company’s I/O developer conference on May 18th&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like a cat may be out of the bag: the company’s testing a feature that should let you stop alarms and answer calls on your Android phone simply by saying “stop” — no need to pick up your phone or even say “Hey Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfJrAn"&gt;We know this because a mysterious new setting called “Guacamole” has popped up in the Google app on Android 11 for some users — including me. (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/23/googles-guacamole-isnt-just-a-delicious-dip-its-a-mysterious-new-assistant-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/23/google-assistant-guacamole/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tipped us off.) And while none of us journalists have been able to actually turn on the feature yet, it’s fairly easy to imagine what it does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8TKHNyd4pn8JRw2MsKun1uidj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466190/guacamole_google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menus where Guacamole can be found, for some users running Android 11 and Google app version 12.15.9.29.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iCGMuz"&gt;If you’d rather not imagine, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it specifically will handle alarms, timers, and calls by letting you say “Stop”, “Snooze” and “Answer/decline the call” respectively. None of those worked for me after I flicked the switch, likely because I wasn’t able to access a Google internal website for dogfooding employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CR9sGeTza32x4HOSzk_BGhDr4Is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22466225/guacamole_web.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqzgC"&gt;I even tried adding a period to make it g.co/assistant-guacamole, thinking the “go” might have been a typo for one of Google’s g.co shortlinks, but no dice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBwruN"&gt;If the feature sounds familiar, it’s probably because Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535647/google-assistant-alarm-stop-timer-hey-update-io-2019"&gt;already shoved some guacamole into its Google Home / Nest Hub smart speakers and displays at Google I/O 2019&lt;/a&gt;. You’ve been able to simply say “stop” to stop their alarms ringing for nearly two years already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC4zaF"&gt;“We’re constantly experimenting with new ways to improve the overall experience with Google Assistant. We have no additional details to share at this time,” Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Officials lift pause on Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="COVID-19 vaccinations for people ages 16 and up in Los Angeles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgwwl3uPZCQ4_vT_LQ-C_FQExnQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178672/1232332507.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJPEZm"&gt;Federal officials said that the United States &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-and-cdc-lift-recommended-pause-johnson-johnson-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-use-following-thorough"&gt;should resume&lt;/a&gt; use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, which has been on pause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;since April 13th&lt;/a&gt;. The company updated the fact sheets about the vaccine for doctors and patients to include information about the risks of clots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYlSZH"&gt;Vaccinations with the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot could start back up as soon as tomorrow morning, said Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt6pJB"&gt;The decision to reinstate the J&amp;amp;J vaccine follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399998/covid-vaccine-johnson-cdc-pause-clots-risk"&gt;the recommendation&lt;/a&gt; of an independent CDC advisory group earlier today. The committee stressed that officials should make people aware of the risk of rare blood clots, which appear most often in women under 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udUiC2"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had instituted the pause after receiving reports of unusual blood clots in a handful of people who received the shot. As of Friday, officials had 15 reports of women developing rare blood clots called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis after receiving the vaccine. Other unconfirmed reports are under investigation. Around 8 million people have received the shot in the US, including 4 million women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMMQ6z"&gt;The clots, which form in the brain, appeared in combination with low levels of platelets, a type of blood cell involved with clotting. The federal agencies recommended the pause so that experts could gather more information about the clots and so they could give doctors information on how to recognize and treat the condition — in this case, the standard blood clot treatments could make things worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0ZrVJ"&gt;Many states were using the one-shot, easy-to-store Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine for people who are homebound, people experiencing homelessness, and other underserved groups. While many vaccination &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2021/04/13/johnson-and-johnson-covid-vaccine-pfizer-moderna/7202207002/"&gt;sites&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://abc7chicago.com/johnson-and-vaccine-pause-moderna-pfizer/10517507/"&gt;switched&lt;/a&gt; people scheduled for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to the Moderna or Pfizer / BioNTech shots instead, some people in vulnerable groups &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/covid-vaccine-johnson-homeless-pause"&gt;weren’t able&lt;/a&gt; to get vaccinated because of the halt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K3UA"&gt;The CDC will keep monitoring cases of the clotting condition in people who get the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmiWV1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bad software sent postal workers to jail, because no one wanted to admit it could be wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3AXE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.postofficetrial.com/2019/01/articles.html"&gt;For the past 20 years&lt;/a&gt; UK Post Office employees have been dealing with a piece of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;software called Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, which had a fatal flaw: bugs that made it look like employees stole tens of thousands of British pounds. This led to some local postmasters being convicted of crimes, even being sent to prison, because the Post Office doggedly insisted the software could be trusted. After fighting for decades, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;39 people are finally having their convictions overturned&lt;/a&gt;, after what is reportedly the largest miscarriage of justice that the UK has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kswYiP"&gt;The impact on these employees has been vast: according to the BBC, some have lost marriages or time with their children. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;Talking to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Janet Skinner said that she was taken away from her two kids for nine months when she was imprisoned, after the software showed a £59,000 shortfall. She also says she lost a job offer because of her criminal conviction. The time she and others like her spent in jail can’t be bought back, and it happened because software was taken at its word.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3Gl8l"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another woman, who swore she was innocent, was sent to prison for theft while she was pregnant. One man &lt;a href="https://www.private-eye.co.uk/special-reports/justice-lost-in-the-post"&gt;reportedly died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; after the computer system showed that he had lost almost £100,000. Within a few months, his replacement also faced losses due to discrepancies from the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kZMeFw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The UK’s prime minister weighed in, calling the original convictions “an appalling injustice”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8aSmvw"&gt;Horizon was made by Japanese company Fujitsu, and information from it was used to prosecute 736 Post Office employees between 2000 and 2014, some of whom ended up going to jail. Bugs in the system would cause it to report that accounts that were under the employees’ control were short — the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;has reported&lt;/a&gt; that some employees even tried to close the gap by remortgaging their homes, or using their own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59dKWt"&gt;It does seem like the nightmare for the employees may be coming to an end. The 39 who had their convictions overturned are following &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55271193"&gt;another six who were cleared of wrongdoing back in December&lt;/a&gt;. The Post Office has also been working on financially compensating other employees who were caught up by the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMfCxQ"&gt;In 2019 the Post Office settled with 555 claimants and paid damages to them, and it’s also set up a system to repay other affected employees. So far, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56718036"&gt;according to the&lt;em&gt; BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, more than 2,400 claims have been made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAXLnD"&gt;Earlier this month the chief executive of the Post Office &lt;a href="https://www.postofficetrial.com/2021/04/nick-reads-speech-to-troops.html"&gt;said that Horizon would be replaced&lt;/a&gt; with a new, cloud-based solution. In the same speech, he said that the Post Office would work with the government to compensate the employees who were affected by Horizon’s inaccuracies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKyAot"&gt;The UK’s prime minister Boris Johnson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1385550075498278921"&gt;also weighed in today&lt;/a&gt;, calling the original convictions “an appalling injustice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CDYuhg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I welcome the Court of Appeal's decision to overturn the convictions of 39 former sub-postmasters in the Horizon dispute, an appalling injustice which has had a devastating impact on these families for years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lessons should and will be learnt to ensure this never happens again.&lt;/p&gt;— Boris Johnson (@BorisJohnson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1385550075498278921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjzN76"&gt;Some employees seem happy with just a monetary settlement and their names being cleared. But there is also now a campaign group calling for a full public inquiry, and some of the people whose names were cleared today have called for those in charge to be held responsible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRLKu7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52905378"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BBC &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Post Office argued the errors couldn’t have been be the fault of the computer system — despite knowing that wasn’t true. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-52905378"&gt;There is evidence &lt;/a&gt;that the Post Office’s legal department was aware that the software could produce inaccurate results, even before some of the convictions were made. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56859357"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;BBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the representatives for the Post Office workers said that the post office “readily accepted the loss of life, liberty and sanity for many ordinary people” in its “pursuit of reputation and profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus has turned on wireless PC streaming for the Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbEyUi-Lzsts5F8-Q47ZCVfDlX8=/781x0:9219x5625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178322/Oculus_Quest_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jPmiJh"&gt;Oculus is turning on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382805/oculus-quest-2-facebook-wireless-pc-streaming-120hz-infinite-office"&gt;Air Link PC streaming feature&lt;/a&gt; for the Quest 2 virtual reality headset. Air Link is part of the Oculus v28 software update, which recently started rolling out to Oculus headset owners. Facebook Reality Labs head &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544"&gt;Andrew Bosworth says&lt;/a&gt; you can find the feature if you’re running v28 on your PC and Quest 2 headset; if you haven’t gotten access to the update yet, “it’s coming very soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ9iR"&gt;Air Link lets Quest 2 owners with a strong Wi-Fi connection play PC VR games wirelessly on their headsets. Air Link was initially disabled on v28. But &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/air-link-launch/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Upload&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, Quest 2 owners had found a way to unofficially turn it on, and Oculus had warned that the experience was “not representative” of the final result. Bosworth says Oculus is releasing the feature today because “the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained”; the release was originally scheduled for next week, so Bosworth’s tweet moves it up by a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="twyoJG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looks like the excitement over Air Link can’t be contained, so we’re officially making it available today for everyone who has both Quest and PC v28. If you don’t have v28 yet, stay tuned, it’s coming very soon!&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1385654671008620544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOgJlY"&gt;Air Link evolved from Oculus Link, which used a USB-C cable to run PC VR games on the otherwise standalone Oculus Quest line of devices. (Oculus says a cable will still give you the best graphical fidelity, and unlike Air Link, it will charge your headset while you’re playing.) A similar wireless feature was already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;built into &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party app. Depending on performance, Air Link could make &lt;em&gt;Virtual Desktop’s&lt;/em&gt; alternative less appealing to Quest 2 owners. But Oculus isn’t currently bringing the feature to its original Quest headset. Air Link is also classed as an experimental feature. If it’s like the original Link, users can expect some bugs around the launch — but at least that launch is coming a little sooner than expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yoda has no time for shoes, but you might for Adidas’ Yoda-themed sneakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3ZWkoD3O14uZUBsO9y-G_0_PEQ=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178303/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_StillLife.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wVTeUJ"&gt;Adidas has designed a pair of Stan Smith sneakers that could be perfect for the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fan in your life who also pulls double-duty as a hypebeast. The Yoda version of the Stan Smith, Forever sneakers features a design inspired by the famous green alien, with quotes and illustrations. Adidas says the shoes will go on sale right after&lt;em&gt; Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; Day, on May 5th, for $120.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGsRS9"&gt;The Stan Smith, Forever line is named after American tennis player Stan Smith, with “Forever” standing for the shoe’s environmentally friendly bent due to its use of “Primegreen” fabric. Adidas claims Primegreen is made from 50 percent recycled materials. The Yoda version is also green in another way, of course. The back heels of the shoes have Yoda’s face embossed in green fabric, and the tongues of both shoes feature illustrations: on one, Yoda, and on the other, Stan Smith himself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BkbGQH0_6p6QcPmBNMAknLcMVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465438/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Tongue.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s Yoda, judging you for judging these Yoda sneakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AamVwpPPvha-LIuTurqW_7N9OZg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465778/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Heel.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There he is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PHj5kV"&gt;Adidas didn’t exactly dig deep for the quote printed on both shoes: together, they read “Do or do not, there is no try.” But it’s sneaky when you think about it: it’s a way to lift Nike’s famous “Just do it” slogan by using the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; version.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gWMXbyemXTIGaRqgoHle_in6F1U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465639/_PR_adidas_SS21_StanSmith_FY5463_Detail_Side.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iconic and inspiring Yoda quote printed on Adidas’ new sneakers. Note Stan Smith on the tongue as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RR3IRJ"&gt;One sort of odd thing about making a Yoda-themed shoe: Yoda doesn’t wear shoes. In every appearance in the film series or &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;animated television series, Yoda is either barefoot or his cloak covers his feet. The dude is clearly no sneakerhead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GiYyxm7SI6xfPiK8rNcPwFaZ3k8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465583/FiveFamousJediContinueToFailToDetectTheSith_AotC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Wookiepedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yoda conducting Jedi Council business, clearly sans-shoes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BThal2"&gt;The same can be said for Yaddle, who — outside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/6/20997564/baby-yoda-disney-plus-star-wars-mandalorian-merchandise-stranger-things-game-of-thrones-streaming"&gt;Grogu / Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; — is the only other known member of Yoda’s species. She also enjoys her three-toed feet unconstrained.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F7g6gSrYrb5mR338dAjl-SLNcVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22465605/YaddleJediCouncil.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;Wookiepedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yaddle, besides always looking incredibly chill, also scorns shoes and all they represent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VAGdlk"&gt;Is a distaste for foot coverings something specific to Yoda’s mysterious alien species? Plenty of other nonhuman Jedi wear shoes. Is it perhaps due to Yoda having thick, leathery, Hobbit-like feet? &lt;a href="https://boards.theforce.net/threads/no-shoes.13529531/"&gt;Some &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans hypothesized way back in 2003&lt;/a&gt; that Yoda’s species could have the same resilient soles that J.R.R. Tolkien gifted his hobbits. Feet strong enough to not need shoes. I certainly see how their argument makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6lDP9"&gt;Regardless of the truth, there’s an unspoken tension that comes from Adidas choosing to make shoes based on an alien who clearly despises footwear, and this isn’t the first time it’s done so. Adidas &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/style/adidas-the-mandalorian-sneakers-baby-yoda-superstar-release-info"&gt;also made shoes based on Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;, a character, you may remember, who spent a large part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/2020/10/30/21517931/the-mandalorian-news-reviews-disney-plus-star-wars-baby-yoda"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with his feet never touching the ground, thanks to a hovering crib. Where does it end, Adidas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWxevO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHAivj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nm4c6w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNC5Ao"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfT9kS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJz6OK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykla2L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sn5zrs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A fourth Captain America movie is in the works from the creator of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nYOL0etI6PQvoLs-Cc1o--wKE4o=/639x0:3201x1708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69178289/OPN0260_105_comp_v099_20201210_r709.1088.147623.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XbAOfb"&gt;A fourth &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; movie is on the way, set to be co-written by &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22333905/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-captain-america"&gt;Malcolm Spellman&lt;/a&gt;, the creator, showrunner, and head writer of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which just aired its season finale on Disney Plus on Friday). Dalan Musson, a staff writer on the series, will also co-write the upcoming film, according to reports from &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/captain-america-4-in-the-works-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-showrunner-malcolm-spellman-exclusive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/captain-america-4-in-development-with-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-ep-malcolm-spellman-writing-1234742675/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EM8p4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="95xwsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for the season finale of The Falcon and the Winter Soldier ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iszm11"&gt;Details on the upcoming film, including a director, cast, and a release date, have yet to be officially announced by Disney. But both reports note that the upcoming film will likely follow up on the finale of the Disney Plus series, which saw Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson take up the shield and title of the new Captain America. The involvement of Spellman would also point to a continuation of that story, which left several plot threads unfinished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsJMDF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;’s report also notes that the upcoming Spellman project is said to be separate from a rumored project that would see the original Captain America, Chris Evans, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/captain-america-eyes-return-to-the-mcu-as-chris-evans-nears-deal-to-reprise-role-in-future-marvel-project-1234672430/"&gt;return to reprise his role as Steve Rogers&lt;/a&gt; in the Marvel universe. Evans and Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/kevin-feige-chris-evans-captain-america-return/"&gt;have denied those rumors&lt;/a&gt;, although it wouldn’t be the first time that a &lt;a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/tatiana-maslany-denies-she-hulk/"&gt;member of a Marvel project&lt;/a&gt; has tried to deny their involvement in one of the superhero films &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/she-hulk-tatiana-maslany-mark-ruffalo-disney-plus"&gt;only to appear later on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70qL5H"&gt;Marvel has yet to make an official announcement about the project, although it’s possible news could be coming soon, similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188516/boba-fett-disney-plus-show-2021-release-date-mandalorian-finale"&gt;Disney formally announced its &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; following that show’s season finale last December. &lt;/p&gt;
