    <title>Justice Department closes criminal probe of Ford emissions testing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NipowuCOIL2ssGVTHfcZbR0Ki4Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776436/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JWLfQt"&gt;The Department of Justice (DOJ) has closed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18517991/ford-criminal-investigation-emissions-testing-problems-dieselgate"&gt;nearly two-year investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the process Ford uses to evaluate the emissions of its vehicles, the automaker disclosed in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799621000012/f-20201231.htm"&gt;a new filing&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Ford says it “cooperated fully” with the probe, but no action was taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDaInW"&gt;Ford originally disclosed the investigation in April 2019, just a few months after it &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/business/ford-emissions.html"&gt;announced its own internal probe&lt;/a&gt; into concerns over the process. Those concerns, first raised by Ford employees, had nothing to do with the kind of deceitful “defeat devices” at the center of Volkswagen’s Dieselgate scandal. Rather, the employees believed there were problems with some of the analytical models Ford was using to calculate things like aerodynamic drag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQWsiE"&gt;Ford said in the filing that California’s Air Resources Board has also closed an inquiry into the company’s emissions testing process, but “[r]eviews opened by EPA and Environment and Climate Change Canada remain open.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmzAj4"&gt;The DOJ and SEC are still separately investigating Fiat Chrysler (which is now known as Stellantis after merging with France’s PSA Group) for its own emissions cheating scandal, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/37996/000003799621000012/f-20201231.htm"&gt;according to a recent SEC filing&lt;/a&gt;. Fiat Chrysler recalled nearly 1 million vehicles in 2019 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18264238/fiat-chrysler-recall-cars-emissions-investigation"&gt;didn’t meet US emissions standards&lt;/a&gt;, and it later settled a civil case with the DOJ that ultimately forced the automaker to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-emissions/u-s-judge-approves-fiat-chrysler-diesel-emissions-settlement-idUSKCN1S91YM"&gt;pay out $307 million to owners of affected cars&lt;/a&gt;. Just &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fiat-chrysler-emissions-idCAKBN27Y0DJ"&gt;one senior manager has been criminally charged so far&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or8W0q"&gt;The DOJ was also investigating Mercedes-Benz parent company Daimler, though the German automaker was ultimately allowed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367768/daimler-diesel-emissions-cheating-scandal-settlement-us-amount"&gt;settle those criminal charges for more than $2 billion last August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ztO1j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this New York Times investigation of the location tracking data of the Capitol rioters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RbyQDmfPogvfcC6Exv__c2w12qk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776428/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AVlXF"&gt;You’re being tracked — around the web, sure, but also in real life: the apps on your smartphone are constantly feeding data into the digital advertising market, where it’s bought and sold by hedge funds, financial institutions, and marketers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;A new report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; underscores the horrifying implications of the system&lt;/a&gt;, featuring location data mined from the rioters who sacked the US Capitol on January 6th, leaked by an anonymous source in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JKxzT"&gt;“This new data included a remarkable piece of information: a unique ID for each user that is tied to a smartphone,” they write. “This made it even easier to find people, since the supposedly anonymous ID could be matched with other databases containing the same ID, allowing us to add real names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses and other information about smartphone owners in seconds.” Those IDs, the authors explain, are called mobile advertising identifiers, and they allow corporations to track people across the web. “They are supposed to be anonymous, and smartphone owners can reset them or disable them entirely. Our findings show the promise of anonymity is a farce,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="606h63"&gt;Furthermore, usage of that data doesn’t seem regulated at all. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story notes&lt;/a&gt;, there aren’t any laws that force companies to disclose what they’re using the data for or how long they’re using it. Even if you know your records were sold, you can’t actually request that it be deleted in most states. That means, once collected, the data can be bought and sold in perpetuity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DH0yyO"&gt;That location data is also somewhat imprecise, which isn’t necessarily a good thing. The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;story takes on one man’s case, in particular: he was at the Capitol riot, and his data possibly places him inside the Capitol as it was being stormed. He denies entering the Capitol. But in the hands of law enforcement, for example, that data might be used as evidence in a criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TVB8TX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/05/opinion/capitol-attack-cellphone-data.html"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; is terrifying for a number of reasons, but the worst is how little control we ordinary citizens have over how our data is used. It’s up to the people in power to do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9J3UOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cappella group covers iPhone tones after nailing Windows sound effects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKzevVtcVPBYgBHjfk1tiPKV0LY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776354/Screen_Shot_2021_02_05_at_10.12.59_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Maytree&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bcS9sP"&gt;In January, South Korean a cappella group Maytree &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252590/maytree-a-cappella-group-windows-10-singing"&gt;wowed us&lt;/a&gt; with their spot-on vocal interpretations of Windows sound effects, and on Friday, the group released a video of their next impressive showcase: interpretations of sounds from iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NxN6cO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1cMdXs6wG0"&gt;The video&lt;/a&gt; is a little over a minute long, and I recommend watching the whole thing, which you can do at the top of this post. They cover a lot of ringtones, including the familiar &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8rew3w8AbA"&gt;“Opening” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, the classic &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTcXZqIZxbA"&gt;“Marimba” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, and even the twangy &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/03YxoOwKxn0"&gt;“Strum” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;. (I should warn you that they also re-create the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48qVYSDur-k"&gt;blaring “Alarm” ringtone&lt;/a&gt;, so be prepared to experience that brief moment of terror.) They even tackle some system noises, including the sounds of text messages being sent and received and a tightly choreographed version of the iPhone’s lock sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nsbiu"&gt;If you haven’t seen the video of the Windows sound effects, you should take 28 seconds out of your day &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4AZB64VBJfA"&gt;to watch it&lt;/a&gt;, too. I think it’s even better than their iPhone video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFexPW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AZB64VBJfA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft suspends donations for politicians who attempted to overturn the 2020 election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rMAsckW8f7tcGfNo8J4VjMKX47M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776136/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxQD4m"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/02/05/changes-to-political-giving/"&gt;announced that it will suspend all donations&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming 2022 election cycle for any members of Congress, state officials, and organizations that voted to object to the certification of electors in the 2020 election or supported attempting to overturn the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNMp1R"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225096/facebook-pause-freeze-political-spending-microsoft"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; all political contributions after the January 6th attack on the Capitol, with Microsoft taking the time to decide “whether to suspend further donations to individuals who voted against certification of the Electoral College.” Today’s announcement makes that decision a permanent one for the coming election cycle, but only for politicians who attempted to overturn President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election. (Other politicians will still be eligible for Microsoft’s donations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fB1DIu"&gt;Microsoft also announced a new company program called the Democracy Forward Initiative. It’s designed as an outlet for employees to donate to organizations that look to enact campaign finance reform and protect voting rights instead of supporting politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sN1Gi"&gt;Lastly, the company also announced a change in the name of its PAC, which was previously known as the Microsoft Political Action Committee (MSPAC). Going forward, the group will be called the Microsoft Corporation Stakeholders Voluntary PAC (MSVPAC) in order to better reflect that the group is “funded exclusively by voluntary donations of Microsoft stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="As8RWP"&gt;Microsoft isn’t the only major tech company to make the decision to stop funding the members of Congress who sought to overturn the 2020 election. Google made a similar announcement at the end of January: its NetPAC “will not be making any contributions this cycle to any member of Congress who voted against certification of the election results.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgl92u"&gt;Other tech companies are also pressing pause: as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2021/01/business/corporate-pac-suspensions/"&gt;CNN&lt;em&gt;’&lt;/em&gt;s comprehensive list shows&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T, Amazon, Verizon, Comcast, Dell, and Intel have all indefinitely suspended any donations to electoral objectors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz6m8b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three countries are due to reach Mars in the next two weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfA_Sl5e3ed63CWhTfEN7ZwrVaE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68776029/acastro_210204_4398_mars_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fleet of spacecraft from three countries will reach Mars in February.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Rsxeiv"&gt;A small fleet of spacecraft from the United Arab Emirates, China, and the United States will reach Mars this month after launching from Earth last year. The march to the Red Planet marks a marathon of firsts: it’s the UAE’s first foray into deep space, China’s first independent attempt to land on Mars, and NASA’s first shot at deploying a Martian helicopter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sF0B1O"&gt;The rare convoy of Mars-bound spacecraft launched off Earth in a slim, roughly two-month window last summer when Earth and Mars lined up just right in their orbits around the Sun. This planetary alignment only happens once every two years, and three countries took advantage of it in 2020, just as outer space reemerged as a playground for scientific discovery and displays of national power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NKulsv"&gt;“These governments do these missions for the sake of exploration,” Bill Nye, CEO of the Planetary Society (and famously, The Science Guy), told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As we like to say, there is no business case for exploring the Martian regolith.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9VNLyF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It leads to this extraordinary workforce development in these countries, and this national pride and sense of community that’s priceless”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mffOT0"&gt;“However, it leads to this extraordinary workforce development in these countries, and this national pride and sense of community that’s priceless,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XaJ1p"&gt;First in line to reach Mars this month is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/19/21330417/uae-hope-spacecraft-emirates-mars-mission-launch-success"&gt;Emirati Hope orbiter&lt;/a&gt;. After launching seven months ago on a Japanese H-IIA rocket, the car-sized Hope probe will arrive in Mars’ orbit on February 9th. It will spend nearly two years surveying the planet’s atmosphere to study daily changes in Martian weather. It puts the UAE on track to be the first Arab nation to deploy an interplanetary probe and join a small group of spacefaring countries that have done the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRb0wv"&gt;“For the science community, it’s where things start,” Sarah al-Amiri, the deputy project manager for the Emirates Mars Mission, said of Hope’s injection into Mars orbit in an interview. The week Hope reaches Mars orbit, UAE researchers will begin to analyze their first trove of interplanetary data, al-Amiri said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQSBIN"&gt;For about six years, Hope’s mission team of roughly 450 people have been designing and testing the Hope spacecraft. The program has a $200 million budget from the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre and has been working with teams at the University of Colorado Boulder, Arizona State University, and the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NQKTu"&gt;As the UAE looks to wean itself off oil dependence, the Hope mission presents a broader opportunity for the country. It’s a chance to figure out how to start a new industry from scratch. “When we say, for example, we’re going to establish a new sector in biotech, how do you go about doing that? This mission provided us a mechanism to go about doing that when we haven’t had it before,” al-Amiri said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdMBQz"&gt;Trailing behind the UAE’s Hope probe is China’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21334654/china-tianwen-1-mars-mission-launch-succssful"&gt;Tianwen-1 spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;, which will reach Mars a day later on February 10th. The five-ton spacecraft will hang out in Martian orbit to survey the Utopia Planitia region, where a large deposit of water ice lies beneath the planet’s surface. Three months later, in May, Tianwen-1 will deploy a lander and rover bundled together for a landing at Utopia Planitia — a daring attempt to become the second country to land and operate a rover on the Martian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iG6aokdnpzqahsghma2JVdMtCPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283753/Etd4rGtUYAAdvKH.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image of Mars captured by China’s Tianwen-1 probe on February 5th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="APoi7u"&gt;Tianwen-1 translates to “questions to heaven” or “questioning the heavens.” The rover carries a suite of instruments to detect deposits of subsurface water ice, which scientists believe could hold signs of microbial life. By observing Mars from orbit and deploying both a lander and a rover, the mission “will become the world’s first Mars expedition accomplishing all three goals with one probe,” Ye Peijian, a top scientist at the China Academy of Space Technology, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjxiZK"&gt;Later this month, China’s Tianwen-1 rover will get some company on the planet’s surface. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21307109/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-launch-date-alien-life"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt;, nicknamed “Percy,” will touch down on February 18th at the Jezero Crater, the site of an ancient river delta believed to bear traces of past life. Its touchdown location is some 1,600 miles away from China’s rover (about the distance between Miami and upstate New York). It’s NASA’s ninth mission to the Martian surface. Like any robot destined for a Mars landing, Perseverance will endure the infamous “seven minutes of terror” — a blazing dash through Mars’ atmosphere for a fully automated soft landing. To mission managers, it’s akin to taking your hands off the steering wheel of a $2.4 billion car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mFLX8O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like taking your hands off the steering wheel of a $2.4 billion car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="onLDmJ"&gt;In that sliver of time, the spacecraft will need to use a combo of parachutes and four propulsive engines to slow itself down from 12,100 mph at the top of Mars’ atmosphere to complete stillness on the Martian surface. A 14-minute communication delay between Mars and Earth means Perseverance’s wicked descent to the Jezero Crater — an unpredictable territory with cliffs, vast sand dunes, and large boulder fields — must be fully automated. By the time mission engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory get word that Perseverance entered Mars’ atmosphere at around 3:48PM ET, the rover will have already made it to the surface — or crashed on impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oKk53"&gt;“These men and women have invested years - YEARS - of their lives into those seven minutes. It’s a big doggone deal,” Nye said. “And you don’t know what’s going on on Mars for those seven minutes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wG9usc"&gt;If all goes well, the compact car-sized Perseverance will use its six wheels to spend at least two years traversing the Jezero Crater, using seven instruments to probe for traces of past or present lifeforms. Those tools include a UV laser to scan for organic compounds, an X-ray spectrometer to analyze the chemical composition of Mars rocks, and two microphones to monitor the rover’s health and record the windy ambiance of Mars. The rover will also gather cigar-sized samples of Martian soil for a future sample return mission in the works between NASA and the European Space Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H5XB3J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Martian equivalent of a Wright Brothers moment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3xfw3"&gt;The most ambitious piece of hardware aboard Perseverance is a box-shaped helicopter called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21339544/nasa-mars-helicopter-ingenuity-perseverance-rover-flight-date"&gt;Ingenuity&lt;/a&gt;, whose test flight “could result in the Martian equivalent of a Wright Brothers moment,” said Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA’s associate administrator for the science mission directorate. Deploying from the rover’s belly, Ingenuity will attempt to fly in Mars’ ultra-thin atmosphere. If it is successful, it may mark the first demonstration of vertical rotorcraft on another world. “If the helicopter succeeds its first flight, the Ingenuity team will attempt up to four other test flights within a 30-Martian-day (31-Earth-day) window,” Zurbuchen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPpwHF"&gt;While each mission has its own individual milestones, the fleet of spacecraft is collectively opening a new era in Mars exploration. With the arrival of these missions, the hunt for signs of off-world life is in full force. UAE, China, and NASA are all racing to gain a better understanding of a world believed to have held life at some point in the distant past or possibly in the present. With Tianwen-1 analyzing potential subsurface lockers of ancient life, Hope scanning the Martian atmosphere, and Perseverance scooping up dirt samples for retrieval, an answer could come soon, Nye said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imdABI"&gt;“What are the chances that someday evidence of life will be found there?” Nye said. “Very high.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install Apple’s watchOS 7 and iOS 14 betas so you can unlock your phone with your watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Oys7a8rhENrMJlvdvmrGbhE9Tg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775811/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267230/apple-ios-14-5-watchos-7-4-public-beta-unlock-iphone-apple-watch-mask"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 beta is out&lt;/a&gt;, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. If you really want this feature right now, you’ll have to download the latest iOS and watchOS betas — something that does come with at least a little risk, as it’s unfinished software. There are bugs, and features might change between updates. There have been reports in the past of &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/81275"&gt;watches being bricked by betas&lt;/a&gt; (though I didn’t find any for this release). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeASH7"&gt;With all that said, I’ve been using the betas since they came out, and I haven’t noticed anything acting particularly buggy. So if you’re willing to throw caution to the wind to get access to the new Apple Watch unlock feature, here’s how you can get the betas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzBPL3"&gt;First, start by going to &lt;a href="http://beta.apple.com"&gt;beta.apple.com&lt;/a&gt; on your iPhone. If you’ve never participated in a public beta before, you’ll have to tap on the sign up button, and if you have, you can tap on the sign in button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxEqZ489LyVm35Ji5D-koFz-3Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284025/IMG_0732.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the Enroll Your Devices button to get the beta profiles for your phone and watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YFs4A1"&gt;Once you’re logged in, tap the down arrow on the header, and go to Enroll Your Devices. I highly recommend following Apple’s advice to make an archived backup of your device, as iCloud backups won’t necessarily be accessible if you have to switch back from a beta. Apple explains how to make one on the Enroll page. Go ahead, I’ll be here when you get back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Qa3boUO7_j3-kTf89yr4uvJra0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284508/IMG_0720.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the Download profile button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sCqqf2"&gt;After you’ve backed up your device, you can scroll down and tap the Download profile button, and your phone will let you know that you have to review the profile before it installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pSN8H7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGTlEk"&gt;Before we do that, though, let’s grab the profile for the watch by scrolling up to the top and choosing WatchOS from the list. There, you can tap the Download profile button, then press Allow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W8Vlv1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322010"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sxIG2k"&gt;This will automatically open the Watch app, where you can press Install. This will reboot your watch, so while that’s happening, let’s install the phone’s profile by going to Settings, then Profile Downloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3e7o03278GFVnxrpT-FLMJdgJmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284528/IMG_0726.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on Profile Downloaded to get to the profile install screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iw7qpK"&gt;There, you can tap the Install button, and your phone will restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w9zi7Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vn3r6v"&gt;After you’ve got the profiles downloaded and your devices rebooted, you’ll have to update your phone, then your watch. Unfortunately, you have to wait until the phone is updated before you can even start on the watch, so you can’t multitask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4, we can finally enable the unlock with watch feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. Toggling it will turn on the feature, there’s nothing you have to do on the watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, if my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, it buzzes you with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked, along with a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxCdLVK4REvsK6vr6V60O8Zvei4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284073/IMG_0716.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting that, again, it is still looking for a face with a mask. This feature won’t help you in the situation where your phone is laying on the table and you want to unlock it without the Face ID camera being able to see you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKPueSpxvejY6raJasBWYsipG9g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284083/IMG_0715.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, for me, not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be relatively minor security trade-offs. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement, whether you decide to go for it right now or wait for the official release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood has stopped limiting GameStop shares</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09mlU72huS24d5vGOx4JjaV3NVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775730/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s39ore"&gt;Robinhood has finally lifted all the restrictions on WallStreetBets-fueled stocks like GameStop and AMC, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-idUSKBN2A51QV?taid=601d5c573cb4af0001e7e97c&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;report on Friday from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently lists no limits on its support document entitled “Changes due to ongoing market volatility,” whereas last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;there were 50-plus companies included on the list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObFw8p"&gt;Robinhood’s decision to restrict buying certain stocks caused a firestorm of controversy, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;harsh condemnations from major public figures and politicians&lt;/a&gt; and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;being review-bombed&lt;/a&gt; on both Android and iOS. For its part, Robinhood said it wasn’t shutting trades down on a matter of principle or due to any shady deals with hedge funds, &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;but because it simply didn’t have enough cash&lt;/a&gt; to meet its regulatory requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7GPwb"&gt;The day the restrictions were put in place, GameStop’s stock closed at $325. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266684/gamestop-stock-gme-down-dip-falling-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;Yesterday, it closed at $53.50&lt;/a&gt;, so it could be argued that the rush is now over. So Robinhood lifting the restrictions doesn’t matter as much anymore, as the massive volume of trading happening last week appears to have subsided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8V9au"&gt;With that said, GameStop stock has seen some activity today, at one point shooting up to $95 a share. At the time of writing, GME is back down in the low-$60 range, and there’s no telling what it’ll close at today. But for the moment, it seems like it’s at least looking a little better than it was yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake delayed indefinitely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HPHZuaxOIRlr6KlwUVkkerl3gfI=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775697/PoP_SoT_KEYART_Wide.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5uNgPx"&gt;We already knew &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21429389/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-xbox-one-ps4-announcement-ubisoft"&gt;a remake for &lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was in the works, and it was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/8/22163944/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;supposed to come out next month&lt;/a&gt;. But if you are waiting to play this long-awaited remake, you will have to wait a little while longer as the game has been delayed indefinitely, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1357735744463278083"&gt;Ubisoft announced on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOlYtT"&gt;Ubisoft Pune, the India-based studio tasked with remaking one of the most popular entries in the series, said the reason for delaying the game again was to ensure it receives extra development time that will allow the team to “deliver a remake that feels fresh while remaining faithful to the original.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NQUiUY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Another update from Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake dev team: &lt;a href="https://t.co/O6OOmYXhOD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O6OOmYXhOD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prince of Persia (@princeofpersia) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1357735744463278083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xQwPTW"&gt;This is the second time Ubisoft has pushed back the release date for &lt;em&gt;The Sands of Time&lt;/em&gt; remake. Originally, the company planned to release the game on &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rlhRMcbyOME"&gt;PC, PS4, and Xbox One on January 21st&lt;/a&gt;, when it was revealed last September. Ubisoft would then delay the game to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1336354862838124544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1336354862838124544%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22163944%2Fprince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;March 18th, attributing the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt; as a reason for delaying the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBmfoU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time &lt;/em&gt;remake is not the only Ubisoft title delayed in recent months due to the pandemic. In October, Ubisoft announced that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/29/21540363/far-cry-6-rainbow-six-quarantine-delay-release-dates-pandemic-covid-19"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Quarantine &lt;/em&gt;would be delayed into the 2021 fiscal year&lt;/a&gt;, meaning both aforementioned titles are slated to launch sometime between April 2021 and March 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Cyberpunk 2077 hotfix lets you safely install mods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F45_YaH9FRtHLlSBDn094Ej6O9U=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68775695/Cyberpunk2077_Always_bring_a_gun_to_a_knife_fight_RGB_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GlCPxF"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; developer CD Projekt Red cautioned against installing mods or custom save files due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263471/cyberpunk-2077-security-exploit-mods-custom-save-files"&gt;a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that could be used to “execute code on PCs.” The studio has quickly turned around a fix, though, and you should now be able to safely install mods again thanks to the 1.12 hotfix released &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1357647227808841728"&gt;on Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7hMoJV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hotfix 1.12 is now available on PC!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This update addresses the vulnerability that could be used as part of remote code execution (including save files):&lt;br&gt;- Fixed a buffer overrun issue.&lt;br&gt;- Removed/replaced non-ASLR DLLs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LAkBfVpnXf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LAkBfVpnXf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1357647227808841728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyZO7H"&gt;CD Projekt Red has released many hotfixes and updates to &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; since its December 10th release to clean up issues with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;notoriously buggy game&lt;/a&gt;. And even the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;1.1 patch&lt;/a&gt;, which was supposed to fix problems, had one big issue of its own — it introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248682/cyberpunk-2077-update-bug-workaround-cd-projekt-red"&gt;a game-breaking bug&lt;/a&gt; that CD Projekt Red &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;has since fixed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHxWzZ"&gt;The studio is planning to release a 1.2 patch at some point in the future, &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;and promises&lt;/a&gt; it will be “a larger, more significant update.” CD Projekt Red is also working on free DLC and a free update to optimize &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for next-gen consoles. &lt;/p&gt;

Mark Warner (D-VA), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), and Mazie Hirono (D-HI), would overhaul Section 230 to the Communications Decency Act, a law that protects large tech platforms from liability over the content posted by their users. The Democrats’ bill would open new pathways for users to sue companies if content posted on their platforms threatens them personally with harassment, discrimination, or other forms of abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRi51J"&gt;The bill also prohibits Section 230 from applying to ads or other paid content on platforms, targeting a large source of revenue for companies like Facebook and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFBIvI"&gt;“When Section 230 was enacted in 1996, the Internet looked very different than it does today. A law meant to encourage service providers to develop tools and policies to support effective moderation has instead conferred sweeping immunity on online providers even when they do nothing to address foreseeable, obvious and repeated misuse of their products and services to cause harm,” Warner said in a statement Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUq4iN"&gt;The SAFE TECH Act is the Democrats’ first big content moderation bill following last month’s deadly attack on the Capitol. Shortly after the riot, tech platforms from Twitter to Parler were targeted for their alleged roles in the violence that transpired in Washington. Parler, the right’s formerly favored free speech platform, was forced offline for weeks after web hosts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;like AWS pulled their services&lt;/a&gt; to the site, alleging that posts on the platform encouraged violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po6YEY"&gt;Following the Capitol riots, lawmakers looked to Section 230 as a means of addressing misinformation and harmful content that may have led rioters to storm the Capitol. Days after, House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called on the FBI&lt;/a&gt; to open an investigation into Parler for its perceived role in the attack. Other House Democrats, like Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), signed onto letters to the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube calling on them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243259/democrats-facebook-twitter-google-capitol-attack-misinformation-radicalization"&gt;audit their algorithms&lt;/a&gt; and make changes that could limit virality on harmful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryUGUQ"&gt;With Democrats now in control of Congress and the presidency, previous negotiations on Section 230 have been flipped on their heads. Changing the law was first championed by Republicans who sought to punish tech companies over the lawmakers’ baseless claims that the platforms were biased against conservatives. Now, Democrats are moving to reform 230 in a way that punishes platforms for disinformation and harmful content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Amgbs"&gt;“We need to be asking more from big tech companies, not less. How they operate has a real-life effect on the safety and civil rights of Americans and people around the world, as well as our democracy. Holding these platforms accountable for ads and content that can lead to real-world harm is critical, and this legislation will do just that,” Klobuchar said in a statement Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
