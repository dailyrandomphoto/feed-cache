    <title>Sony announces next-gen VR headset for the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wGeEdu"&gt;Sony is working on a next-generation VR headset for the PS5. The headset won’t launch this year, but Sony is announcing early plans to make it available on the PS5 at some point in the future. Sony’s new VR headset will include an improved field of view, resolution, and even a single cord to make it easier to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="anTtC3"&gt;“We’re taking what we’ve learned since launching PS VR on PS4 to develop a next-gen VR system that enhances everything from resolution and field of view to tracking and input,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/02/23/introducing-the-next-generation-of-vr-on-playstation/#sf243317607"&gt;says Hideaki Nishino&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s head of PlayStation platform and planning. “It will connect to PS5 with a single cord to simplify setup and improve ease-of-use, while enabling a high-fidelity visual experience.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s original PlayStation VR headset.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3UyL1Q"&gt;Sony is also working on a new VR controller, which will use some of the features found in the DualSense PS5 controller. The VR controller will also focus on improving ergonomics. “There’s still a lot of development underway for our new VR system, so it won’t be launching in 2021,” says Nishino. “But we wanted to provide this early update to our fans, as the development community has started to work on creating new worlds for you to explore in virtual reality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4vJaK"&gt;Sony will start issuing development kits for its next-gen VR headset soon, but the company isn’t detailing the full specs or release dates just yet. This new hardware is clearly designed to improve some of the limitations of the original PlayStation VR headset. “Given this was our first foray into virtual reality, it gives us a chance to apply lessons learned,” says PlayStation boss Jim Ryan in an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/02/23/ps5-vr/"&gt;interview with the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “One of the very vivid illustrations of that is that we will be moving to a very easy single-cord setup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0CGNN"&gt;Sony’s original PlayStation VR headset debuted more than four years ago, and you need a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538861/sony-psvr-camera-adapter-ps5-compatible-request-form-online"&gt;special camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; to use it on the PS5. Sony has remained committed to the accessory, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540786/sony-playstation-jim-ryan-psvr-headset-timeline-ps5"&gt;admitted that VR still has a long way to go&lt;/a&gt;. With a next-generation headset now in the works, we’ll soon find out what games Sony has planned to improve the future of VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This 26-year-old CEO is helping esports grow up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3p3XnVmPt_xHlHwhhgNHeQOCNss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861040/VRG_ILLO_4421_Decoder_NicoleLaPointeJameson.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Evil Geniuses CEO Nicole LaPointe Jameson on reinventing the industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="HGRJkX"&gt;For a long time, people have predicted that playing video games competitively would become a big business, rivaling traditional sports leagues like the NBA or NFL. But it’s been a long process, with challenges and setbacks along the way. There’s an audience — lots of people tune in to watch teams play games like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; — but the business models and ecosystem around the industry haven’t had a ton of success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMdH5J"&gt;For this week’s episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder,&lt;/em&gt; I spoke with Nicole LaPointe Jameson, CEO of esports company Evil Geniuses, to figure out how an esports team makes money, where the industry is headed, and where she sees growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cdNP08"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/6RiNeMEoYdcAHcEaNxtEfk" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5SDzB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This excerpt has been lightly edited for clarity. A full transcript of this conversation will be available on February 24th, 2021. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wngXIk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the current business of Evil Geniuses in esports, and what do you think that business should look like? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyaZB0"&gt;So bear with me if you’re an esports expert, but taking a step back. The esports industry’s a bit of a misnomer in that it really encompasses two bimodal — often intersecting, but frequently not — business models. One of them is traditional sports, except think of us like a university athletics department. I’m the University of Michigan. But instead of basketball, football, soccer under one brand, I have &lt;em&gt;Dota&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXkFoE"&gt;There’s that business model, which has the same models you would see in traditional sports: sponsorship, IP and media rights, direct advertising, etc. But esports being a digital platform also bridges entertainment, so you think of content creators, digital influencers, and all of those revenue models and revenue streams. That also exists in esports. So we’re a bit of a blended form of both of those. When I had entered EG, we were just the former. We were just the athletics model, which is great. That’s the thesis we believe in. It’s why we’re here to be competitive, but it wasn’t profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQUYD8"&gt;You can’t operate player salaries that look akin to pro athlete salaries. [They] are not sustained on esports-level sponsorships today. So we really focused on bringing peripheral revenue streams into the business to support what we do but that also don’t deprecate from the core product of who we are. And how that’s manifested is, of course, the entertainment side of house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1WkJf"&gt;We’ve also developed deep collegiate and education platforms — how to bridge the world of gaming, how to make gaming accessible to different audiences — as well as data analytics and even fantasy embedding products. So we’ve been able to pull in things using our core athletics platforms to really help self-sustain the business in the past two years to keep the esports product alive but keep the lights on at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLcbqx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the questions I have for all of these digital media and entertainment models — and obviously, I work in digital media so I think about this a lot — but one of the questions that always comes up is it seems like so rarely is the core product itself the money. It’s the universe of things around it that hopefully add up to enough money to keep the core product alive. That is very different than a traditional sports league, right? Owning the Lakers is just a lucrative proposition because the Lakers play basketball, and people buy tickets, and you’ll sell the rights, and you can just do it that way&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBDtJa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here, and almost everywhere in digital, it seems like the core thing rarely makes the money itself. It is almost a loss-leader. Is that how you think of your model? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6Uyhm"&gt;I wish I had a better and more shiny answer for you, but it definitely resonates. You know, we believe in the team. The team is the crown jewel. We wouldn’t have a value proposition to exist without the athletic side. But it’s not supported by the magnitude of the revenue with league revenue share like you’d find in traditional sports today. I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t believe that won’t change over time. But today, I would be a bad fiduciary to my investors if I said, “Yeah, let’s just go athletics. That will work.” Because it won’t, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFa3er"&gt;But also on the bright side: unlike traditional sports, the beauty of esports — you saw it during COVID: pro sports leagues stopped. Entertainment and the sports space stopped. They weren’t sure what to do, and we could keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnD2RQ"&gt;We have a very sticky product by being digital and by being more flexible and how we engage, excite, and monetize the fan and consumer. And that’s something that while the playbook isn’t well-established ubiquitously across all of the esports universe, people are flushing it out and figuring it out and finding interesting sticky trends here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VzvjM9"&gt;So it’s very much an industry in formation still.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit’s Mindful Method is an exclusive wellness program for Premium subscribers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2mwlRJlbLl9lsfItSTesuyccB7s=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68861006/20200920FitbitSense7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CBRAnu"&gt;Fitbit is launching an exclusive wellness program for Fitbit Premium subscribers called Mindful Method. The program is created by alternative medicine specialist Deepak Chopra and builds on the company’s focus on stress management that started with the Sense smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXjdy9"&gt;Mindful Method encompasses over 30 audio and video sessions on topics like mindfulness, sleep, stress management, wellness, and the mind-body connection, Fitbit says. The program is taught by Chopra, a renowned author and wellness expert, with more sessions from Chopra planned to be released over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEu2ao"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From biofeedback to bioregulation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bEEdv"&gt;In a press presentation of the new program, Chopra led attendees through a sample meditation from Mindful Method. Overall, the experience was not that different from what I’ve done in other meditation apps like Calm or Headspace, though Mindful Method aims to differentiate itself by featuring more of Chopra’s philosophy of wellness combined with the data provided by Fitbit’s watches and Premium service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmXJi6"&gt;Fitbit says Premium already features over 100 mindfulness audio tracks, but adding new ones from a recognizable name could make a difference for the Fitbit owner who hasn’t decided to pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835674/fitbit-premium-subscription-service-personalized-data-challenges"&gt;$9.99 a month for Premium&lt;/a&gt; yet. Mindful Method also builds on Fitbit’s strategy of not just collecting and displaying a variety of data, but making it actionable, what Chopra summarized in his presentation as the move from “biofeedback” to “bioregulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulCtow"&gt;When Brent Rose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;reviewed the Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, he found the device’s electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to provide a generally accurate view of when he was stressed, displayed in the Fitbit app’s Stress Management Score. The existing meditations in Premium where a good way to see how that score could change with some controlled breathing and mindfulness, but now Mindful Method might provide an even more comprehensive way to learn about why you’re stressed and what to do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWTQKD"&gt;The first 10 sessions of Mindful Method with Deepak Chopra are available now for Premium subscribers in Fitbit’s app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7taUz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new AR ‘Smart Viewer’ lets you pin virtual screens to your walls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Qualcomm XR1 Smart Viewer" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f0kC4Wc5MQsPxFNkTTHvvAblzlg=/655x0:4200x2363/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860960/Lifestyle_Virtual_Monitors_XR1_AR_Reference_Design.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c4go2O"&gt;Chip maker Qualcomm has introduced a new reference design for augmented reality glasses: an AR “smart viewer” you can tether to a phone or PC via USB-C. Called the XR1 Smart Viewer, the system is meant to be lightweight and look (sort of) like sunglasses, while also enabling features like hand tracking and spatial awareness. The first glasses based on its design are set for release in mid-2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlDNIO"&gt;The XR1 is designed as a consumer-focused “must-have accessory” for phones and computers, rather than a self-contained product. It uses two 1920 x 1080 OLED displays with a 90Hz refresh rate, plus an array of cameras, to add a virtual overlay to the real world. The camera array can also support hand tracking as a control scheme, and it can detect planes in the environment, so you can do things like pin a virtual window to a wall for multiple PC displays — or place a virtual object on a table and interact with it through gesture controls. Like most AR glasses, however, they have a relatively limited field of view of 45 degrees, which is roughly similar to the &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/hololens-2-field-of-view/"&gt;Microsoft HoloLens 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="XR1 Smart Viewer" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NNzisMlNe0S8syiYm7TnzhXNoY4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22322533/Product_Shot_1_XR1_AR_Reference_Design_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J0Kaks"&gt;Lenovo already announced a product based on the XR1 Smart Viewer reference design: the &lt;a href="https://news.lenovo.com/pressroom/press-releases/thinkreality-a3-most-versatile-smart-glasses-ever-designed-for-the-enterprise/"&gt;ThinkReality A3 glasses&lt;/a&gt;, which it &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/lenovo-thinkreality-a3-ar-glasses/"&gt;unveiled at CES&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. ThinkReality A3 glasses are set for release in mid-2021 at a currently unlisted price, following up on Lenovo’s A6 &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/lenovo-thinkreality-a6/"&gt;business-focused headset&lt;/a&gt; from 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNWzjX"&gt;The XR1 Smart Viewer is distinct from the Snapdragon XR1 or XR2 platforms — a pair of chipsets that are optimized for virtual and augmented reality glasses, including last year’s XR2-based Oculus Quest 2. It’s designed to perform some tasks using built-in electronics, but it offloads other tasks to an external computing device, allowing for a more lightweight design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6OwZTL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first Smart Viewer-based glasses could launch in mid-2021&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E90T7b"&gt;Qualcomm has spent the last couple of years &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;pushing for AR glasses adoption&lt;/a&gt;, which it thinks could stimulate the nascent 5G cellular market by popularizing high-bandwidth mixed-reality apps. It’s previously partnered with Chinese company Nreal on the Nreal Light, one of the only consumer-focused AR viewers — which plugs into a Qualcomm Snapdragon 855- or 865-powered phone. The Nreal Light launched late last year in Korea and Japan, and yesterday, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/22/nreal-unveils-enterprise-edition-of-mixed-reality-glasses/"&gt;Nreal announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will arrive in the European Union and the US later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5C8oGb"&gt;So far, AR glasses have struggled to reach the mainstream. However, the ThinkReality A3 and any other XR1 Smart Viewer-based products may end up competing with a couple of major companies. Facebook announced its impending entry into AR hardware last year, and it’s planning to release a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;set of Ray-Ban smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; with limited AR-like features later in 2021. Apple is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;rumored to be making&lt;/a&gt; a high-end AR / VR headset aimed at building a developer ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify CEO Daniel Ek explains how the company plans to help artists (and itself) make money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sC4hjmJww7UbNm0zTvU2f5WSE0g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860942/vrg_4436_spotifyCEO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Alex Castro | Photography by Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company wants to be at the center of creator monetization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xrWisz"&gt;Spotify hosted an event on Monday to discuss its ambitions in audio, and one message came through loud and clear: the company wants to play a major role in helping creators make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt73jy"&gt;During the 90-minute event, the company rattled through a series of announcements. It detailed a slew of new podcasts, including one featuring former President Barack Obama and rockstar Bruce Springsteen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22291508/barack-obama-bruce-springsteen-spotify-podcast-announcement"&gt;as co-hosts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a full universe of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295156/dc-comics-spotify-universe-podcast-superhero"&gt;DC Comics programming&lt;/a&gt;. It debuted an expanded podcast ad marketplace, bolstered by its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557458/spotify-megaphone-podcast-streaming-ad-insertion"&gt;Megaphone acquisition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056336/spotify-streaming-ad-insertion-technology-ces-launch"&gt;Streaming Ad Insertion&lt;/a&gt; technology, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;a Hi-Fi subscription tier&lt;/a&gt;. And it teased new tools for podcasters to engage with their audiences and make money through subscriptions. Spotify obviously intends to make podcasting a real revenue driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDUwCh"&gt;But none of the announcements were groundbreaking for people in the industry. If anything, they demonstrated how far Spotify has yet to go. Crucially, Spotify announced that 7,500 musicians are making at least $100,000 per year through its platform, which isn’t much considering the service is available in 93 markets. Now, Spotify is trying to make the same pitch to podcasters as it did to musicians — that they’re all on the same side and share the same goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z6nrao"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify’s announcements set it up to achieve its broader ambitions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bPZuHQ"&gt;Spotify will both support its own shows and also host and sell ads for third-party programs, all with the stated goal of helping creators profit off their work. That seems like a tall order, and one that podcasters might hesitate to participate in, but Spotify CEO Daniel Ek says it’s critical to the company’s future. He tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Spotify will incorporate a hybrid business model with three distinct parts. One will involve the typical user subscription revenue, another is advertising dollars through its podcast ad marketplace and music streaming ads, and the third is a la carte options, like helping musicians and podcasters sell merch, tour tickets, or even subscriptions to their own content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYGW9v"&gt;“I think you’re going to see platforms making a distinction of not a one-size-fits-all, not just in terms of the creators or how they think about their audience, but really about how you can grow your audience, engage with them, turn them into fans, and then create new and important ways to monetize that fan base,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46DkZ6"&gt;Following the event, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; chatted with Ek about the tension between launching Spotify’s own exclusive shows while also trying to sell ads, as well as how Spotify might help creators monetize. And yes, we asked about Clubhouse, too. You can read an edited version of the interview below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06liCI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ashley Carman, senior reporter, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: Today your team announced that 7,500 creators are making at least $100,000 per year on your platform. How does Spotify plan to grow that number?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETl9OK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daniel Ek, CEO, Spotify:&lt;/strong&gt; Long term, it’s really about — as I kind of outlined in the remarks, as well, during the event — we think the space is so much larger than most people realize, both in the amount of consumers that care, the minutes that will be spent in audio, and the amount of creators that ultimately will create content. So it’s in the billions of consumers, and we believe more than 50 million creators will create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoWnto"&gt;Obviously, not all of these [creators] are going to be able to support themselves full-time doing this, but our job is to create as many possibilities as possible for these creators to create, to grow, to engage, and to monetize with their fans. And I’ve talked about this in the past, but I think the future of Spotify, and really all successful media companies, is by allowing a multitude of different monetization models. In the past in the internet, you’ve seen platforms choose either to be ad-supported or to be subscription. In the future, I think you’re going to see ad-supported, subscription, and a la carte play key roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns22TN"&gt;I think you’re going to see platforms making a distinction of not a one-size-fits-all, not just in terms of the creators or how they think about their audience, but really about how you can grow your audience, engage with them, turn them into fans, and then create new and important ways to monetize that fan base. How you monetize an average consumer the first time you have them listen to you is going to be very different than how you monetize one of your super fans. And in that future, I think Spotify will recognize all of those different abilities and allow the creator to find the best ways to monetize their fan base based on both their ability and how they think about sustaining their creative endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYQdri"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What timeline are you thinking about this on? Five years? Ten years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18N4nK"&gt;It’s really a long, long-term goal, but the way I think about the world is really, if you think over the next 10 years for certain, what’s now radio is going to collapse and move from a linear space to an on-demand space. And all of those minutes spent, and we’re talking two to three hours a day of the average American, just to name one example, is now going to move online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vIb4c"&gt;When you look at that space, which I think is just really, really interesting, all of audio as a category will grow — not just the minutes spent, but I think monetization, too — when you bring infinite level sophistication to it. So the targeting that you can imagine, the types of interactivity features you can create, and the types of monetization you can enable by having both ad-supported subscription and pay wall, so it’s really kind of the next decade that I think this will play out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZORP1"&gt;And that’s where I think we’re in this race to try to get as many people as possible to convert into streaming on demand and hopefully choose Spotify as their preferred platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C65a2J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...what’s now radio is going to collapse and move from a linear space to an on-demand space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJBZuG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some musicians argue that streaming devalues their work while podcasters see the industry as not needing to be fixed or changed. How do you plan to keep the narrative positive and not like a corporate behemoth entering the space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElpzYs"&gt;Community management is going to be one of the most critical things, but honestly this is part of the reason why we wanted to put this event out. Because what we realized is that we’re no longer this kind of small startup from Sweden. We’re in fact a very, very important platform for a lot of these audio creators. So rather than just telling everyone about everything that we’ve already released and then explaining them one by one, we wanted to create a narrative story that tells people about where we’re going and why we’re going there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnTJgm"&gt;So I think this is exactly the type of reason why we wanted to have the event that we’re having today, and I think so much of this is going to be solved by constant communication and by also experimenting and being clear when we are experimenting. You saw that today, too. A lot of the features that we released are really tests and experiments, and the reason isn’t because we’re not committing to rolling it out if it’s successful, but it is because we want the feedback from the community so that we can iterate and improve and hopefully create something that better suits their needs and methods. So we’re really kind of changing our way of working in order to invite more of the creative ecosystem to give feedback and help us iterate and improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va8fu8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify has focused a lot on launching platform-exclusive podcasts. What are the metrics of success for an exclusive show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BpXS"&gt;We have a number of different metrics that we’re internally looking at evaluating the success of this, but a huge part of it is just around can we create an awareness, can we create an audience for a creator that rivals the one that they would have been able to [make] on their own? And I think so far, we’re obviously early in our sort of exclusive efforts, but what we’re seeing is it’s very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcOsuJ"&gt;We are seeing that people are in fact tuning into Spotify, even though there was a creator maybe available in some other outlets before, as evidenced, for instance, by Joe Rogan being the number one podcaster on Spotify. And as they’re engaging, they’re finding more and more other podcasters, as well. And so the average listener on Spotify is now listening to a lot more podcasters than they were doing before, so that’s helping both the creator, and the consumer, and the whole creative ecosystem, as well. So we’re looking at a number of different KPIs (key performance indicators) to kind of evaluate if this is working or not, but ultimately, it’s all about creator retention and user retention. Those are the most important metrics that we track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Xykec"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you concerned with whether you can convert listeners to paid subscribers through the exclusives?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KdwGS"&gt;No, not really. What I can tell you from 15 years of doing this now is, if we start with music, the reality is there wasn’t too many people that woke up in the morning thinking, “I’m going to find a music streaming subscription service to subscribe to.” That just wasn’t the case. But there were a lot of people that were looking for how can I listen to music? That turned out to be a very good amount of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlKJ4Z"&gt;And what we found is that as they got into Spotify and started listening, because of the platform, and because of the features, and because of the recommendations that we were offering, people started engaging a lot more. So the number of people that, from the beginning, said, “I’m never, ever going to pay for music,” because they may have come from a pirate environment that then slowly turned into, “This is just an amazing service. I’m getting so much value out of this. It’s a no-brainer to start paying.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7XvsL"&gt;My point by telling that story is that what we found so many times before is that the more people engaged, the more likely they are to pay. And the same is true with music as it is with podcasts, too. It’s really all about getting them onto the platform and starting to expose them to this entire ecosystem of creators and amazing content that we have on the platform. And once that happens, we know people eventually will convert into paying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k1yEV0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“...the more people engaged, the more likely they are to pay.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cBLt98"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify also debuted its podcast ad marketplace today, so I’m wondering how exclusives play into that. Exclusives seem to go against the point of ads — brands want to reach the largest audience possible. How might you make choices about keeping something exclusive versus letting it reach as many people as possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLSOlB"&gt;I think, overall, the main trade-off as a company is we’re all focused on growth, and growth is a function of engagement, the retention part that I talked about. So we monitor those metrics meticulously, and we’re looking at it for every single piece of content that we have on the platform and every single consumer we have on the platform, and just on an hourly basis modeling that, looking at that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk3Qf4"&gt;The answer, however, may be unintuitive, but I still want to share it which is, in the end, I think this whole notion about what is ads and what’s subscription, and the fact that when you look back on the internet there was this division. I just don’t believe that’s going to be true in the future. Think about television. It used to be the same way. You had broadcasting that only had ads and then you had cable that was the only subscription, but the reality is it converged because it turned out that the better consumer experience was the combination of both, and I think you’re going to find that into the future of the internet, too, is that we can deliver a great user experience with both advertising and subscription, and I think the future for us is both and a la carte, as well. So it’s really kind of three models, and that’s when you bring to bear the entire opportunity of the internet, I think, for monetizing that content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5a1CZS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you don’t worry about turning off premium, paying users by having ads in your Spotify podcasts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0l1lWr"&gt;We’re constantly monitoring it, but I don’t think you should view it as we’re having ads or we have no ads. I think the future may be that some consumers don’t mind ads and would rather have that as something, and some people may not enjoy ads a lot. Our ad system should be able to realize that and be able to serve ads depending on who’s engaging with that content and what their propensity is to engage with that advertising, as well. And I think you’re going to see lots of different ways to monetize, I guess is what I’m trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qo7LcP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social audio, specifically Clubhouse, is super buzzy right now. What are your thoughts on it? Is it something Spotify would ever consider building into the app?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYzZMG"&gt;I think that there’s a number of different elements of what social audio or Clubhouse even is. So I think on the one end, you’re seeing the interaction between two or more people talking, and obviously if you think about podcasts today, that’s typically the format that’s working pretty well there, too. So I’m not surprised that that’s working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMzQ5I"&gt;I’m also not surprised that social features, users to users interacting with each other, are working. So it is an interesting space, and it’s definitely something that we’re keeping an eye on. Long-term, though, I think the broader shift that has been true with the internet has been most of the hours of consumption, we believe, will be moving from linear to on-demand. Meaning consumers should be able to consume whatever content that they want on their terms and not necessarily be beholden to someone else’s schedule. So I think it’s a really interesting format from a creation perspective, but I suspect that from the consumption perspective, most of the time consumed will still be on-demand which is what Spotify is known for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="06nvbq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like Clubhouse, podcasts already rely on peer-to-peer conversation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gkbdWJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you worry about Clubhouse taking people away from the time they typically listened to podcasts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsfE15"&gt;Andy Grove, the [former] CEO of Intel, said 30 years ago, “Only the paranoid survive,” and it’s definitely something that I think he was right in assuming. But I’m paying as much attention to Clubhouse as I am looking at &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. All forms of media and entertainment is minutes that could have been spent listening to audio instead. So we’re definitely paying attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYgbpU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about the creator side of things, but I want to focus on the listeners. Much of Spotify’s strategy is dependent on their data. How do you think about communicating with listeners to explain how you use their data? Do you worry about a pushback?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cInYkA"&gt;Obviously that’s super important for us, and being a European company with its roots in Europe, too, GDPR is a massive thing here in Europe, and so we take user’s privacy very, very seriously. It’s obviously something that we constantly think about as we’re evolving our data products, both to consumers but also to advertiser partners, and I think you will see that we’re very, very careful about how we’re using our users’ data in every aspect that we’re doing and conducting business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy84jX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify announced its Hi-Fi subscription tier today with hardware partnerships to come. Amazon is making moves in the podcast space, and Apple is already established. Both those companies also offer hardware for audio playback. Is hardware something you think Spotify will need to invest in on its own?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXv7Q4"&gt;We have something internally that we call the Ubiquity Strategy, and what you saw me talking about today is the fact that we have 2,000 [hardware] partnerships now, and, in fact, because of this network of creators that we now have — 8 million — and all the exclusive content we have, we’re seeing great success on the Google Home speakers, and the Alexa devices, Sonos, Sony PlayStation, GM cars, and just the breadth and wealth of this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC113k"&gt;I would have been a lot more concerned if consumers were locked into just one ecosystem. If it was just an Apple, or just a Google, or just an Amazon that kind of owned the consumer across their entire ecosystem. That is a very concerning development, if it were to be true. But I think the good news is what we’re finding is that while Apple, for instance, is very strong on mobiles in many markets, we’re finding Amazon is very strong in their homes, and most of the cars today are being built on Android Auto, which is Google’s ecosystem. And the one thing that is true about Spotify is we play nice on all of them, and I believe we’re the only player that has that relationship where we’re now on 2,000 devices, and we play nice on all of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cEsouv"&gt;And that’s been our strategy from day one, and I think that would be very hard-pressed to do if we were also a hardware maker. So we think about the experience. We think about ubiquity, and we want to be everywhere where our consumers are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star’s launch means lots of new content for Disney Plus — but not in the US </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j7wMnYIAM59WhTYcjRB8M1HFedw=/332x0:2291x1306/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860749/Screen_Shot_2021_02_22_at_4.44.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1613767772.029500"&gt;Today marks the launch of &lt;a href="https://disney.co.uk/disney-plus-star"&gt;Star&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a new section of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22165950/disney-star-streaming-service-hotstar-international-movies-tv"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; for international audiences that will offer more mature R-rated films, TV shows from FX, and other shows and movies that Disney owns the rights to but don’t fit into Disney Plus’ family-friendly image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtPuXm"&gt;Star is effectively Disney’s solution to the fact that Hulu doesn’t exist in international markets. It marks a way for the company to expand on the value proposition of Disney Plus to international customers with the most crucial currency any streaming service has to offer: a bigger library of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8tIc9"&gt;What that means is that international users are about to get a massive influx of movies and shows available on Disney Plus, through Star, that won’t be available for US customers — or rather, won’t be available to US customers through Disney Plus. Those shows and movies will instead continue to live on Hulu as part of the separate service instead. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zUZa9Ot9CWEngbf7hD-E93d8-n0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10839339/mb0340_pubstill_v0212.1010_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Twentieth Century Fox&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d4RiP7"&gt;If you’re an international Disney Plus customer who lives in the UK, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Portugal, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, or Canada — the regions that will get access to Star starting today — that’s great news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIYbR4"&gt;Conversely, if you’re a US customer, you may feel a bit cheated. The library that Disney is offering on Star includes TV shows like Family &lt;em&gt;Guy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; How I Met Your Mother&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Lost&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Firefly&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Grey’s Anatomy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Buffy the Vampire Slayer&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Bones&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;along with movies like &lt;em&gt;Deadpool 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Borat&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Braveheart&lt;/em&gt; — films and shows that Disney already owns the rights to but requires that customers pay up for an extra Hulu subscription to watch in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwjJUM"&gt;This is because of a complex matrix of rights deals and revenue streams. While Star and Hulu will have a fair amount of overlap — including Hulu originals like &lt;em&gt;Love, Victor&lt;/em&gt; — Hulu in the US still features a far bigger library, including shows and movies licensed from third-party studios such as MGM and Paramount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo0gT8"&gt;Star, on the other hand, will only &lt;a href="https://cdnvideo.dolimg.com/cdn_assets/59da8d0ddb454cffaa4026308c5bee445ed9d216.pdf"&gt;feature first-party content&lt;/a&gt; that Disney has the rights to from its own studios (which include ABC, Hulu, FX, Freeform, 20th Television, 20th Century Studios, and Touchstone Pictures). It seems that Disney’s balance sheet has arrived at the conclusion that subscribers are willing to pay for the separate Hulu and Disney Plus libraries in the US, but that the more limited Star lineup was enough to justify a standalone paid purchase for international customers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9rWg-zaLent54CPVjsSc4w-T2pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19745053/Screen_Shot_2020_02_25_at_9.27.59_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0eQ2Rv"&gt;Part of that distinction also comes down to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/10/11193086/verizon-att-carrier-crapware-revenue-trick-samsung-software"&gt;the Angry God of ARPU&lt;/a&gt; (average revenue per user) — something that’s on Disney’s mind a lot as it looks to build out Disney Plus around the world. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;Looking at Disney’s 2020 earnings&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s direct-to-consumer streaming business was up 73 percent year over year, with revenue of $3.5 billion. But it actually made &lt;em&gt;less &lt;/em&gt;money from each customer on average, with ARPU down to $4.03 per subscriber, largely due to the substantially lower cost of Disney Plus Hotstar in India and Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwxpi8"&gt;(Star, incidentally, is not to be confused with Disney Plus Hotstar, which operates under the Disney Plus banner and features Disney’s original shows and films but is a vastly different service in terms of pricing and distribution than Disney Plus / Hulu in the US and Disney Plus / Star in other international markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L81FQI"&gt;Turning Star into a cheaper international version of Hulu doesn’t help fix that ARPU problem. But using Hulu content to boost Disney Plus subscribers in the more lucrative (per customer) markets of Europe, Australia, and Canada does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZNzQ2"&gt;That’s&lt;em&gt; especially&lt;/em&gt; true once you factor in the fact that Disney is also using the Star rollout to increase prices in those markets from €6.99 per month to €8.99, which marks a proportionally larger increase than the $1 price increase (from $6.99 to $7.99) planned for Disney Plus users in the US later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7JyFl"&gt;And using that big pile of Star content to sweeten the pot is the perfect answer for Disney because it already owns the rights to all of it. Unlike Hulu, which costs Disney a ton in licensing costs and ad-revenue deals, adding Star to Disney Plus internationally doesn’t cost it a penny. It just better monetizes things the company already owns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pBZKHy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Star, unlike Hulu, doesn’t mean more licensing costs for Disney&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lHYhKQ"&gt;That’s even reflected in the branding itself: last year, CEO Bob Chapek announced that it would be using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354712/disney-star-streaming-service-international-expansion-hulu-plus-abc-fx-fox"&gt;Star brand internationally&lt;/a&gt; instead of Hulu, citing both the fact that Hulu has the association of aggregated content as well as its lack of brand awareness outside of the US.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuKFgs"&gt;In fact, the existence of Star could be a glimpse at a possible future for Disney’s streaming endeavors in the US, should Hulu end up being unsustainable as stakeholders continue to pry back their licensed shows and films for their own streaming services like Peacock, Paramount Plus, or HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUQHxw"&gt;If Disney is planning to offer a single unified streaming service in the US, it’s still some ways off, though. For now, US customers will have to shell out for the Disney bundle (which includes Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN Plus) if they want to stream FX shows &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYisup"&gt;But whether you live in the US with Hulu, or Canada with Star, there’s one main winner in all of this: Disney’s bottom line. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google struggles to fix its new Stadia game after shutting down own studios</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z4QpcB"&gt;Google is struggling to fix one of its new Stadia games, after closing down its own in-house game studios earlier this month. &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet &lt;/em&gt;debuted on Stadia on February 1st, the same day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;Google shut down its Stadia studios&lt;/a&gt; and fired a number of developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qj7LpC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet &lt;/em&gt;was developed by Typhoon Studios, a studio Google acquired to build out its first-party Stadia titles. Players of the game have found it’s riddled with bugs on Stadia, including game breaking issues that won’t let certain players get past the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AMDLBu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game launched on Stadia earlier this month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFHbun"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-02-23-stadia-struggling-to-fix-journey-to-the-savage-planet-bug-after-firing-developer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit users have been complaining about the issues for weeks, and it’s not clear who will actually fix it. As employees at Typhoon Studios have either left Google or moved on to new roles, &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt; players on Stadia have been trying to reach out to Google, and publisher 505 Games. While 505 Games published the game on other platforms, it’s Google that owns all the game code and data according to a support response that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/lp5ver/rant_google_im_disappointed_journey_to_savage/"&gt;Reddit users claim to have received&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptb2be"&gt;That’s left players confused at who will fix the game, and Google has stepped in to promise it’s looking into the issues. “We’re aware of this and our team is diligently working with our partner publisher on a fix,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia/status/1363426586943389696"&gt;says the Stadia team on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. A Google employee also posted on the Stadia subreddit to confirm the company is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Stadia/comments/lqc1io/update_regarding_issues_with_journey_to_the/"&gt;looking into the issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VTilo"&gt;It’s not clear when a fix will be available, and the game is still bundled free as part of Google’s Stadia Pro subscription. &lt;em&gt;Journey to the Savage Planet&lt;/em&gt; was one of the first games to launch from Google’s Stadia Games and Entertainment first party internal development organization. It’s now shaping up to be a memorable last one, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dream of mid-air wireless charging teased with rollable Oppo X</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnofQDNtJeeqWU0JBdKfWuyPlgY=/88x0:736x432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860411/Jyr8m06UdO.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OHAS6g"&gt;Oppo has teased a new wireless charging solution that works when a phone is up to 10 cm (3.9 inches) away from a charging pad. The company has shown off its Wireless Air Charging tech in a &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4607703588020148"&gt;30-second clip on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/oppo-to-unveil-innovations-partnerships-at-mwcs-2021/"&gt;coincide with MWC Shanghai&lt;/a&gt;. The clip shows the Oppo X 2021 rollable concept phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt;, charging above the pad, even when held at an angle. The technology offers charging speeds of up to 7.5W, Oppo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgVaeJ"&gt;The Chinese manufacturer is the latest to announce a truly wireless air charging solution, following Xiaomi and Motorola’s teases from earlier this year. Back in January, Xiaomi announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;Mi Air Charge Technology&lt;/a&gt;, which it says can charge multiple devices at 5W “within a radius of several meters.” The next day, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-no-contact-wireless-charging/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on a demonstration from Motorola which showed one of its phones charging 100 cm (40 inches) away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CWsriV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;video controls="" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"&gt;Your browser does not support HTML5 video.&lt;source src="https://f.video.weibocdn.com/002un6p6gx07KAuN5DFt01041200ctFy0E010.mp4?label=mp4_1080p&amp;amp;template=1920x1080.25.0&amp;amp;trans_finger=0bde055d9aa01b9f6bc04ccac8f0b471&amp;amp;media_id=4607697065279496&amp;amp;tp=8x8A3El:YTkl0eM8&amp;amp;us=0&amp;amp;ori=1&amp;amp;bf=4&amp;amp;ot=h&amp;amp;ps=3lckmu&amp;amp;uid=3ZoTIp&amp;amp;ab=3915-g1,966-g1,3370-g1,1493-g0,1192-g0,1191-g0,1258-g0&amp;amp;Expires=1614082265&amp;amp;ssig=gG5MHIjc46&amp;amp;KID=unistore,video" type="video/mp4"&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37mkFZ"&gt;At 10 cm, the range of Oppo’s technology is more limited than Xiaomi’s competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oppo-contactless-charging-1203197/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. The video’s presenter makes a very deliberate effort to hold the phone directly above the charging mat. However, the charging is shown working even when the phone is slightly tilted above the wireless charger, and while playing back a video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPJyZN"&gt;Distinctions like this are academic right now since none of these technologies have been released in commercial products. Xiaomi has confirmed its technology won’t be ready to release this year, and the rollable phone that Oppo used for its demonstration also doesn’t have an official release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lU0Nt3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A closer look at Wireless Air Charging&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working on or off axis with the charger, you can charge up and use the smartphone at the same time without being tethered to a charging stand or cable!      &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPOxMWC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OPPOxMWC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9iiunPBzPs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9iiunPBzPs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— OPPO (@oppo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oppo/status/1364108983821234178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVDxYm"&gt;As well as developing wireless chargers that work over longer distances, manufacturers are also working to make standard wireless charging faster. Xiaomi is developing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522730/xiaomi-mi-80w-wireless-charging-technology-announced"&gt;80W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; solution, which it announced just months after Oppo revealed its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325289/oppo-125w-fast-charging-65w-airvooc-wireless-charger"&gt;65W wireless charging tech&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YGJC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 23rd, 6:53AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with official name of charging solution, and more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s an interactive 4K view of Perseverance’s Mars landing site</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x7S8PCm-Qp1z7kKm0nSW1nFk_vg=/86x0:2465x1586/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860299/mars_rover_360.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uqzMmt"&gt;NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory has posted an interactive 360-degree view of the Perseverance landing site on Mars in 4K resolution. It’s the latest jaw-dropping imagery to return from the mission, including that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295739/nasa-perseverance-rover-landing-mars-video-footage"&gt;incredible video&lt;/a&gt; of the rover plunging through the Martian atmosphere before being “skycraned” down to the surface of the red planet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wmdpi"&gt;The 360-degree video was captured by Perseverance’s color Navcams perched atop a sensing mast above the rover. The scene can be navigated in a browser or in the YouTube app on your phone or 4K smart television. The images were captured on February 20th, two days after the Perseverance landed in the Jezero Crater. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lq2RVo"&gt;Perseverance has a total of &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/cameras/"&gt;23 cameras&lt;/a&gt;, the most of any Mars rover to date: 16 for engineering and science and another seven that recorded those dramatic images of entry, decent, and landing. Audio captured at the landing site by Perseverance’s microphones has also &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa%2Ffirst-sounds-from-mars-includes-rover-self-noise&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F23%2F22296788%2Finteractive-4k-360-degree-view-mars-perseverances-landing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;been posted to NASA’s Soundcloud account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-rQzTJyUdIVVFZxorSPknbk6tcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22322364/mars_2020_cameras_labeled_web_full2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA image showing location of the two color Navcams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XYV3PZ"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance mission has already made public a total of &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/multimedia/raw-images/"&gt;4,796 raw images to date&lt;/a&gt;. Perseverance is capable of transmitting data at rates up to 2Mbps to the orbiters overhead. The Mars orbiters then relay the data back to Earth using their much larger antennas and more powerful transmitters. The video of the vehicle descending down to the surface amounted to about 30GB of images stitched together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dMAHQ"&gt;The Perseverance rover is designed to seek signs of life and better understand the ancient geology of Mars. It will spend at least one Mars year (two Earth years) exploring the area around the landing site.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook brings back news after Australian government amends upcoming law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xub-iudHy2nODLjOZTmQ3XP_H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68860276/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EvhhJ5"&gt;Facebook will restore news content to its platform in Australia after the government agreed to amend its proposed News Media Bargaining Code. In an &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/changes-to-sharing-and-viewing-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;update posted today&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s William Easton, managing director of Australia and New Zealand, said that the company is “satisfied that the Australian government has agreed to a number of changes and guarantees that address our core concerns.” News content will return to the platform “in the coming days,” Easton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSYHRd"&gt;Facebook and Google have been at loggerheads with the Australian government about an upcoming law that will require them to pay publishers for content shared on their platforms. In response to the proposed bargaining code, Facebook took the extreme measure last week of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;blocking news from being shared on its platform&lt;/a&gt; by Australian users and publishers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJ351b"&gt;The amendments, which were outlined in a &lt;a href="https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/additional-amendments-news-media-and-digital"&gt;release from the Australian government&lt;/a&gt;, include giving tech companies and publishers two months to reach agreements with one another, which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/technology/facebook-australia-news.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; appears to give Facebook more time to strike deals, similar to those reached by Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SXnPRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has committed to entering into good-faith negotiations with Australian news media”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8ld5mM"&gt;Another amendment notes that the government should take into account whether a tech company has already reached commercial agreements with the Australian news industry. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that this opens the door to Facebook and Google to avoid the most feared aspects of the bargaining code by signing more media to their respective Facebook News and Google News Showcase products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qnhcb4"&gt;The big US tech companies are particularly concerned about the law forcing them into arbitration with news companies if they can’t reach a deal. They claim this arbitration process underestimates the value their services provide to news publishers, such as web traffic that can then be monetized with ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pscPIF"&gt;In a statement, Facebook’s vice president of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown said the Australian government “has clarified we will retain the ability to decide if news appears on Facebook so that we won’t automatically be subject to a forced negotiation.” She added that it means Facebook can “support the publishers we choose to, including small and local publishers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XJ9Fg"&gt;Responding to the deal, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg said “Facebook has committed to entering into good-faith negotiations with Australian news media businesses and seeking to reach agreements to pay for content,” the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-agrees-to-last-minute-amendments-to-media-code-20210222-p574kc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoP0eE"&gt;While Facebook took the extreme step of blocking all news in the country in response to the law, Google has been busy &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/news-corp-agrees-deal-with-google-over-payments-for-journalism"&gt;brokering deals with the country’s news publishers&lt;/a&gt; to pay them as part of its News Showcase product. As part of the product, Google is also making deals with international publishers to cover other publications around the world. Initially, Google had also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to withdraw services from Australia&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KA3Ae3"&gt;With the amendments signed off on Tuesday morning, the &lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt; notes that the legislation could pass through the country’s Parliament as soon as Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
