    <title>Amazon buys nine ULA rocket launches for its space internet satellites</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTDtw"&gt;Amazon bought nine launches from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance to send its internet-beaming Kuiper satellites into space, the companies announced. It is Amazon’s first launch agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZ3jpC"&gt;The deal is for ULA’s workhorse Atlas 5 rocket. An Amazon spokesman declined to say how many satellites each launch will carry or how often they will launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCuDqz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the Kuiper program last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1o1vLZ"&gt;Amazon is planning to build a so-called constellation of 3,236 satellites in space to bring internet to rural parts of the world that have little to no connectivity. It’ll also serve as a major infrastructure boost to its mammoth cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. But details on the network have been scant since the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348768/fcc-amazon-kuiper-satellite-constellation-approval"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the company’s network for launch in July 2020. The competition is stiff, too: both OneWeb and Elon Musk’s SpaceX are also deploying broadband internet networks in low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjRRYF"&gt;The FCC requires Amazon to launch at least half of its Kuiper network — roughly 1,618 satellites — by July 2026. The Atlas 5 missions will help Amazon meet that goal, but the company could use other rockets as well. SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388378/elon-musk-starlink-satellite-internet-service-moving-vehicles-trucks-2021"&gt;far ahead&lt;/a&gt; of Amazon with its own internet constellation, has been using its Falcon 9 rocket to ferry 1,355 of 12,000 satellites for its Starlink network so far. OneWeb has launched 146 of its roughly 650 satellites planned for its network. And another company, Telesat, plans to launch 300 satellites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bx8OOX"&gt;Amazon’s Kuiper satellites are designed to fit atop different types of rockets, but the ULA deal provides Amazon with a “capable, reliable rocket” for its first Kuiper launches, Amazon’s VP of technology for Project Kuiper, Rajeev Badyal, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amONQj"&gt;Kuiper satellites will orbit Earth at an altitude range of 590 to 630 kilometers (or 366 to 391 miles). Amazon says Kuiper prototypes have proved speeds of up to 400Mbps, “and performance will continue to improve in future iterations.” Last year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178235/amazon-project-kuiper-user-terminal-antenna-internet-satellite-constellation"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; designs for the antennas customers will use to tap into Kuiper internet. Those antennas can also connect to other satellites in geostationary orbits, or deeper orbits at least 22,000 miles away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeDsaV"&gt;Amazon pledged to invest $10 billion into the program last year — roughly the same investment SpaceX has said it’s making for Starlink. In its statement on Monday, the company said it has over 500 people working on Kuiper and that its “team is heavily focused on inventing new technology to make broadband more affordable and more accessible for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsRUBO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A win for ULA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xISZw8"&gt;Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’ space company, is in the late stages of developing a heavy-lift rocket dubbed New Glenn. Though Amazon could still pick New Glenn in the future, the rocket isn’t ready yet. Instead, Amazon is working with ULA, a company with ties to Blue Origin: its upcoming Vulcan rocket is powered by the same Blue Origin-made engines in New Glenn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2l0mB"&gt;The deal is a win for ULA, an industry heavyweight that has fallen behind SpaceX for commercial launches. While SpaceX has launched at least two commercial missions this year, ULA hasn’t launched anything. SpaceX’s reusable rockets are cheaper than ULA’s — even though ULA has slashed its Atlas 5 prices to as low as $100 million from as much as $187 million. But SpaceX is, of course, Amazon’s satellite competition, which may have made a SpaceX rocket less palatable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwmZ1E"&gt;Low-Earth orbit, a shallow orbital layer where all these companies’ internet satellites will operate, is already getting crowded as SpaceX speeds ahead with Starlink deployment. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; this month that OneWeb recently made SpaceX disable its automated collision avoidance system when two of their satellites were projected to collide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPhUxy"&gt;Industry competitors, including Amazon, have criticized SpaceX’s collision avoidance system for not sharing with other operators how it will move a Starlink satellite in the event of a potential collision. Analysts say rules requiring cooperation in orbit are a must, especially as Amazon aims to launch thousands of satellites in the same orbital neighborhood as SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let’s talk to Sen. Ed Markey about fixing the internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKsu6OdbfC4WoHuApq9dlivw8mE=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150086/VER_VergeLive_Article.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xu6vIF"&gt;In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216843/georgia-runoff-net-neutrality-fcc-jon-ossoff-raphael-warnock-democrats-senate"&gt;the future looked bright for net neutrality&lt;/a&gt;. After a surprise victory in the Georgia special elections, Democrats gained a majority in the Senate, opening the door for aggressive new Federal Communications Commission leadership that could reinstate net neutrality by regulatory order. There was even talk of passing a bill that would enshrine net neutrality in law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3Eq4SG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VDZaaI"&gt;In the three months since then, not much has happened. Preoccupied with the pandemic, the Biden White House has focused on shepherding through its relief and rebuilding efforts, a pair of massive spending bills that require every bit of political capital Democrats can spare. As a result, even basic measures like appointing a new FCC chair have taken a back seat to more urgent matters. But that may finally be changing, with rumblings from the FCC and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18206984/net-neutrality-bill-congress-new-fcc-markey"&gt;poised to introduce a net neutrality bill in Congress in the months to come&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOPafK"&gt;In a new &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; Live event on May 12th, we’ll dive into the net neutrality fight and the broader progressive effort to upgrade America’s internet. With so much of Washington focused on infrastructure, there’s never been a better time to take stock of the broadband gap and the various ways the government can make sure America stays online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeG3qG"&gt;After a few opening words from &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel, we’ll have a conversation with Markey, talking through the path forward for net neutrality in this Congress. Just like our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287443/section-230-amy-klobuchar-internet-regulation-panel-event-sign-up"&gt;March event&lt;/a&gt;, the whole thing will be virtual, but you’ll be able to drop questions in a chat room if there’s anything you want to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUiusy"&gt;We won’t be posting the full video publicly, so the only way to see it is to &lt;a href="https://www.voxmediaevents.com/thevergeliveinfrastructure/article"&gt;sign up here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NHTSA is investigating the driverless Tesla crash that killed two people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IHGtbtl9e6QPQ-7Q0eTBSDaCM08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149991/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uqr3Ek"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has dispatched a team to investigate the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;fatal Tesla crash in Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in which two people were killed after their vehicle crashed into a tree with no one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pllvTL"&gt;A spokesperson from the NHTSA said the agency is coordinating with local law enforcement to learn more about the incident and will “take appropriate steps” when investigators have gathered more information. The spokesperson did not respond to a follow-up question about whether that would include a recall of Tesla’s Autopilot feature that was likely involved in the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2YB6NB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“take appropriate steps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DgO0Zr"&gt;So far, the investigation appears to involve only officials from the NHTSA, and not its sub-agency, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). A spokesperson for the NTSB, which has investigated dozens of Tesla crashes over the years, said he has “no information regarding the crash or any current involvement from the NTSB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Tlmfy"&gt;Local authorities have yet to identify the two men, aged 59 and 69, who were killed in the crash. The duration of the fire, which lasted four hours and required 30,000 gallons of water to extinguish, is said to have made identification difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CqJyC"&gt;The incident took place at 9PM local time in Spring, Texas. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, investigators are “100 percent certain” that no one was in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash. Minutes before the crash, the wives of the men were said to overhear them talking about the Autopilot feature of the vehicle, which was a 2019 Tesla Model S, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/18/business/tesla-fatal-crash-texas.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MvkER"&gt;This is the latest crash involving a Tesla to be scrutinized by federal investigators. The NHTSA has sent teams to inspect similar crashes involving Teslas that took place in recent weeks in Houston, Lansing, and Detroit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rWp8SE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The latest incident involving a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ESLlO9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338427/tesla-autopilot-crash-michigan-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;This is also the latest incident&lt;/a&gt; to involve a driver using Autopilot crashing into a stationary object. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629214/tesla-autopilot-crash-death-josh-brown-jeremy-banner"&gt;at least two fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; in which a Tesla owner has smashed into a stopped vehicle, and Tesla has yet to address it in any meaningful way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qp8PV"&gt;This crash is unique, though, in so far as it involves a vehicle with no one in the driver’s seat. In the past, Tesla has warned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. That said, the company’s marketing has been shown to be needlessly confusing, including the use of brand names like “Autopilot” and “Full Self-Driving” that implies the vehicle is more capable than it actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7IjCS"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment, likely because the company has dissolved its press office and typically doesn’t respond to media requests anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYumRJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>UK to investigate Nvidia’s Arm acquisition on national security grounds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XeTEPaI2nZEJyQunFvtDSNxJaoI=/104x0:1268x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149910/CeLOBOX.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2dO6O"&gt;The British government has &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/digital-secretary-instructs-cma-to-look-into-nvidias-takeover-of-arm"&gt;ordered an investigation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s proposed $40 billion acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of UK-headquartered chip designer Arm. The country’s competition regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), will prepare an initial report on the takeover by the end of July, which will cover potential national security issues, as well as competition and jurisdictional issues created by the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGTIfI"&gt;“I have today issued an intervention notice on national security grounds,” the UK’s digital secretary Oliver Dowden said in a statement. “The UK’s independent competition authority will now prepare a report on the implications of the transaction, which will help inform any further decisions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tw0Iml"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5qqXuD"&gt;“It is appropriate that we properly consider the national security implications of a transaction like this,” he said. In its press release, the UK government notes that Arm is a key player in the global semiconductor market and that these are integral to the UK’s national infrastructure and security. Arm’s designs are also popular with smartphone processor manufacturers, with &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-starts-national-security-probe-of-nvidia-s-40-billion-deal-to-buy-arm-11618837683?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; noting&lt;/a&gt; they’re used in over 95 percent of devices sold worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zetTn8"&gt;Once the CMA presents its report, Dowden has the option of clearing the deal, imposing conditions to deal with any issues found, or ordering a “phase two” investigation, which would explore the deal in more depth. The digital secretary has the power to order an investigation like this in any deal involving the takeover of a company with more than £1 million in annual revenue where there may be public interest concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYIVfa"&gt;“We do not believe that this transaction poses any material national security issues,” Nvidia said in a statement. “We will continue to work closely with the British authorities, as we have done since the announcement of this deal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRscaI"&gt;Nvidia will not be the first foreign owner that Arm has had. It’s acquiring the company from Japan’s SoftBank, which has owned the chip designer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToFcJV"&gt;Today’s announcement comes after the CMA initially &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-to-investigate-nvidia-s-takeover-of-arm"&gt;said it was preparing to investigate the deal&lt;/a&gt; on competition grounds. “We will work closely with other competition authorities around the world to carefully consider the impact of the deal and ensure that it doesn’t ultimately result in consumers facing more expensive or lower quality products,” the CMA’s chief executive, Andrea Coscelli, said at the time. The US Federal Trade Commission is also reportedly reviewing the deal, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOAyUR"&gt;As well as national security and antitrust issues, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d76f9bd0-31be-47ba-9877-09afa37aecc7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that concerns have been raised that Arm’s headquarters could be moved away from Cambridge by the US-based company. However, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has said his intention is to expand this base, keep Arm’s intellectual property registered in the country, and retain its current name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bThz35"&gt;Arm doesn’t manufacture chips; it provides designs to other chip manufacturers, including Qualcomm, Apple, and Samsung. Some of these companies have reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;raised concerns about the acquisition&lt;/a&gt; to regulators that Nvidia could change how Arm licenses out its designs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings debuts Marvel’s latest martial arts hero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1t6LFCEiZiF-xqovNlcosUC-xI=/471x0:1986x1010/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149434/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_9.57.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkS9Nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; has gotten its first trailer, showing off the high-flying martial arts action and a new hero for the interconnected universe of Marvel films and shows: Shang-Chi (Simu Liu), who’s known in the comics as Marvel’s preeminent master of martial arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU08zd"&gt;The trailer serves as a short introduction to Shang-Chi as he faces off against the mysterious Ten Rings organization and its true leader, the Mandarin. The Ten Rings have been a figure lurking in the background for the entirety of the MCU, first introduced in 2008’s&lt;em&gt; Iron Man&lt;/em&gt; (and notably spoofed by a copy-cat group in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;), but &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; promises to reveal the actual group for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w0WnSL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5D9LQf"&gt;The upcoming film also takes some inspiration from the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2020/10/1/21495236/marvel-shang-chi-comic-review-gene-luen-yang"&gt;more recent &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; series of comics&lt;/a&gt;, which sees the martial arts master trying to enjoy life in San Francisco away from mystical (and family) drama only for his old life to come crashing back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tt7nz0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first modern live-action martial arts-focused Marvel project; Netflix previously adapted &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; into a two-season TV series in 2017, but that project was developed by the now-defunct Marvel Television, instead of Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14980216/iron-fist-problems-marvel-netflix-writing-villains-optics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Fist&lt;/em&gt; also suffered from numerous issues&lt;/a&gt;, including lackluster fight scenes, a bloated runtime, and a frustratingly outdated white savior narrative — all things &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; (with its considerably bigger budget, tighter cinematic runtime, and considerably more diverse cast and creative team) looks to avoid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G6mnF"&gt;The trailer comes hot on the heels of Liu teasing the first poster for the upcoming film on Twitter, which also showcases a look at Shang-Chi’s full superhero costume (which notably doesn’t appear too much in the trailer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJj1dS"&gt;

    <title>Facebook ramps up moderation around Derek Chauvin trial, will delete posts mocking George Floyd’s death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Minneapolis Area Continues To Grapple With Police Brutality As Chauvin Trial Verdict Looms" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uQJmkR3Pm77NvOjEhpbbF8knXs0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149387/1313185888.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5CCRlj"&gt;Facebook says it’s taking extra moderation measures around the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer accused of murdering Minneapolis man George Floyd last year. As a verdict in the trial approaches, Facebook has designated Minneapolis a “high-risk location” where it will seek and remove calls to bring weapons to events. It will also remove content that “praises, celebrates, or mocks George Floyd’s death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2VVHB"&gt;Facebook content moderation VP Monika Bickert outlined &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/preparing-for-a-verdict-in-the-trial-of-derek-chauvin/"&gt;preparations for a verdict&lt;/a&gt; in a blog post this morning. “We want to strike the right balance between allowing people to speak about the trial and what the verdict means, while still doing our part to protect everyone’s safety,” Bickert writes. Users can “discuss, critique, and criticize the trial and the attorneys involved,” but Facebook will remove content that violates its policies, and it “may also limit the spread of content that our systems predict is likely to violate our Community Standards.” And it will “remove events organized in temporary, high-risk locations that contain calls to bring arms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aOyP0d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users can still “discuss, critique, and criticize” the trial&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqrnZw"&gt;The company will delete “severe” attacks on Chauvin, although Facebook considers the former officer a public figure for “voluntarily placing himself in the public eye” — as opposed to Floyd, who is granted a higher standard of protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCDTmi"&gt;Much of Bickert’s post outlines steps Facebook is supposed to take with all content. But it indicates that Facebook could be particularly vigilant in, for instance, removing incendiary event pages around Minneapolis. Last year, the company was criticized for not removing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403004/facebook-kenosha-militia-groups-shooting-blm-protest"&gt;a self-proclaimed militia’s “call to arms”&lt;/a&gt; in Kenosha, Wisconsin, until a fatal shooting took place during the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meAd4z"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337583/atlanta-shooting-attack-facebook-posts-removed-supporting-praising"&gt;made a similar announcement&lt;/a&gt; last month around the mass shooting in Atlanta, Georgia, when it banned any posts that celebrated the attack or the alleged killer. However, Chauvin’s trial is a more potentially volatile situation, especially as footage of police violence — like the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-56768217"&gt;shooting of 13-year-old Adam Toledo&lt;/a&gt; — has spread on social media during it. Facebook says that “given the risk of violence following the announcement of the verdict, regardless of what it is, we remain in close contact with local, state and federal law enforcement” after the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord loosens NSFW server ban on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fo9Y470qpMa7BxBVrzCcx-O9Ot4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149324/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qTaBqj"&gt;Discord has &lt;a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation"&gt;loosened its ban&lt;/a&gt; on accessing NSFW servers from its iPhone and iPad apps. Now, only servers focused on “explicit pornographic content” will be fully blocked from being accessed through the apps. Other NSFW servers will still be blocked by default, but users will be able to opt in to viewing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgAnsC"&gt;The changes walk back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381728/discord-nsfw-servers-blocked-ios-age-gate-restrictions"&gt;a stricter ban on NSFW content&lt;/a&gt; that Discord put in place &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210413070907/https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005389362-NSFW-Server-Designation"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. On April 12th, Discord said it would require server owners to mark their community as NSFW if it was “organized around NSFW themes.” Under the original plan, any server marked NSFW would have been inaccessible on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x0tIsO"&gt;Users were frustrated with the changes, though, since it limited their ability to communicate with others and moderate servers they were in charge of. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Discord for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRE4fR"&gt;Discord hasn’t said why the restrictions were added, but it clearly has to do with Apple. Apple has firm restrictions on nudity in the App Store, and Discord may have risked an outright ban if it didn’t block content to come into compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mno4Gs"&gt;Apple does offer &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#user-generated-content"&gt;a partial loophole&lt;/a&gt;, though, which Discord is taking advantage of: “incidental mature ‘NSFW’ content” is allowed in iOS apps, so long as it’s hidden by default. Apple requires that users opt in via a website — not the app itself — and that’s exactly how Discord has set up its system to reenable access to NSFW content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8ibw3"&gt;The changes don’t solve the problem for Discord users entirely, but they could offer continued access for some concerned roleplay and art communities that were unsure if they would be able to reach their servers because of the ban.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 headset comes with a free accessory at Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P0Fn5Pi4MuRfBptOSSEqzSi7Ol8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149308/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RCrdsb"&gt;If you’re hunting for an Oculus Quest 2 VR headset, Newegg has an appealing sale happening on bundles that will net you a free accessory. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4237997%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;For $350&lt;/a&gt;, you can get the 64GB headset (normally $300 by itself) with Logitech’s G333 VR wired earbuds and the Oculus Elite strap. Both accessories would usually add $100 to the total, but with this bundle, you’re saving $49, so it’s like you’re getting the ever-useful and comfortable Elite strap for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IDrpq7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8gLpC"&gt;Newegg has other bundles that might appeal to you more. It has one that includes the headset with the Logitech earbuds and the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up carrying case instead of the Elite strap. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238013%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This one costs a total of $359&lt;/a&gt;, so you’re paying just $10 for the case instead of $50. The other great bundle &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2FProduct%2FComboDealDetails%3FItemList%3DCombo.4238012%26quicklink%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;option for $349&lt;/a&gt; includes the headset, earbuds, and Oculus’ fit pack with a pair of light blockers and two alternate-width facial interfaces made for “users with low nose bridges and wider or narrower cheekbones,” as &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Faccessories%2Fquest-2-fit-pack%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ site says&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

This gadget usually costs $50, and it might suit you perfectly if you need a bedside alarm with some smarts. Its display shows the time, weather conditions, and current alarms, and it doesn’t take up much space. It also has a USB-A port around its back that you can charge a device through. It can play music, but it won’t be a suitable stand-in for the Google Nest Audio, as its speaker isn’t nearly as good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wjI1SN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10273272"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TgvNl6"&gt;One of Amazon’s deals of the day is a sizable discount on its Fire HD 8 tablet with 32GB of storage that comes bundled with the Blink Mini camera. It’s normally $125 if you pay full price for both products, but you can snag them for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B08XV5X86G/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 right now (and for the rest of Monday, April 19th) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738214635752240878#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; is in on the deal, too, if you prefer to shop there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="79IOtc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9560044"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s xCloud beta arrives on iOS and PC this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oWT2Iub2qs3ihOyDkYk0v0-rf2M=/0x0:1786x1191/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69149306/xcloudiphoneipad.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFhN71"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) will officially arrive on iOS and PC tomorrow, April 20th. The service will arrive on devices via browsers, allowing Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to play Xbox games on iPhones, iPads, and PCs. Microsoft is keeping this beta rather limited, though, and requiring players to be invited to participate in the testing phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rl7H2c"&gt;The service will be accessible at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fxbox.com%2Fplay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F19%2F22391561%2Fmicrosoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;www.xbox.com/play&lt;/a&gt;, where Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers who have been invited to the beta will be able to play Xbox games through Edge, Chrome, or Safari browsers. More than 100 games will be available, and testers will be able to use a compatible Bluetooth or USB-connected controller or simply use custom touch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Lc2QJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A limited beta will be available in 22 countries&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t3yIhV"&gt;“The limited beta is our time to test and learn; we’ll send out more invites on a continuous basis to players in all 22 supported countries, evaluate feedback, continue to improve the experience, and add support for more devices,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-cloud-gaming-windows-pc-and-apple-limited-beta/"&gt;says Catherine Gluckstein&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s head of xCloud. “Our plan is to iterate quickly and open up to all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the coming months so more people have the opportunity to play Xbox in all-new ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Np1o"&gt;It’s the first time Xbox Game Streaming has been available on iOS devices after the service launched exclusively on Android phones and tablets last year. Microsoft wasn’t able to offer xCloud on iPhones or iPads during the initial launch phase of the service back in September due to Apple’s restrictions on cloud gaming apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV739"&gt;Both Apple and Microsoft got into a public war of words over xCloud, and Apple initially insisted that Microsoft would have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;submit individual games for review&lt;/a&gt;. Apple eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;offered a compromise&lt;/a&gt; to allow cloud gaming apps to run on iOS with individually reviewed games, but Microsoft branded it a “bad experience for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku Voice Remote Pro review: a nice upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Roku’s new $30 remote has upgrades like a rechargeable battery and hands-free voice commands&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="0cwfK6"&gt;Roku’s new Voice Remote Pro is the company’s first remote control to come with always-listening mics built in. These let you easily launch a streaming app or find the remote itself, should it get lost in the couch cushions, using just your voice. The new $29.99 remote, a standalone purchase that works with Roku streamers and Roku TVs, also has a headphone jack for private listening and includes buttons for controlling your TV’s power and volume. And to round it all out, Roku throws in two customizable shortcut buttons that you can program to remember any voice command and repeat it with a press. Perhaps best of all, you won’t need to hunt for AA batteries anymore: the Voice Remote Pro replaces them with a rechargeable battery that can last for up to two months on a charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdCTlX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10453604"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OgUOrh"&gt;It definitely looks the part of a Roku remote. Weight-wise, the Voice Remote Pro felt about the same in my hand as the remote that came with my TCL Roku TV. But instead of a removable back cover, there’s a Micro USB port at the bottom of this one. Yes, I very much wish it was a USB-C jack instead, but Roku chose the older plug. Either way, it’s largely hidden from view when you’re using the remote since it’s behind the purple Roku tag. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HaPcAUj7ZlWDFyzeWB01zt2rf_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448507/DSCF3627_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Voice Remote Pro has a rechargeable battery that uses a Micro USB connector.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fdVvS1"&gt;On the left side is a 3.5mm jack that will pass the audio from your Roku TV or Roku streaming device to whatever headphones you plug in. Private listening remains a huge convenience, though other platforms like the Chromecast with Google TV, Fire TV, and Apple TV support Bluetooth earbuds to achieve the same end result; if you need to keep a room quiet but still want to enjoy a show or movie, you can have your own private bubble of sound without disturbing others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1LRUp"&gt;There’s another new addition on the remote’s left side: Roku has included a sliding switch to enable or turn off the Voice Remote Pro’s always-listening mode. Some people aren’t comfortable with microphones constantly being on in their home and listening for a wake phrase. If you switch off hands-free mode, you can still press and hold the microphone button on the front of the remote to speak commands. On the right side are a volume rocker and mute button. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0x2xABclZAR__aqRhVuByj7iNmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448504/DSCF3622_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a slider switch to enable or turn off the always-listening mics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PqOBVN"&gt;All of the buttons on the face of the Voice Remote Pro are the same size as those on my TCL Roku remote, though this remote is a bit taller since it adds two programmable buttons above the four branded shortcut buttons. Roku’s marketing images show an Apple TV Plus button alongside Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. But the remote I received to review actually had Sling TV on there instead of Apple’s service. Roku tells me it’ll be changing this in future shipments, which I take as a sign of how recently its deal with Apple came together. The buttons aren’t remappable, so if you want the Apple one, it’s probably best to wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NH22OJ"&gt;Some people don’t mind these branded buttons since they’re easy to use and straightforward: others complain that there’s always some app or service in the foursome that they either don’t have or never use. Sometimes the buttons manage to outlive their advertised services: Roku has had Blockbuster, PlayStation Vue, and Rdio on its remotes before — all services that no longer exist. I can understand both arguments, but considering how much money Roku rakes in from those quick-access shortcuts, the sponsored buttons are here to stay. Thankfully, Roku has at least made a good decision by including two customizable buttons to go along with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB4EZ8"&gt;The buttons labeled “1” and “2” can save any voice command that Roku supports; just long-press either button after the voice command, and it’ll be set as that button’s function. This can be as simple as using them as two shortcuts for apps that don’t have their own button, like “open HBO Max” or “open Peacock.” But you can also use the shortcut buttons for searches (“show me free movies”), input selection (“switch to antenna TV”), or TV controls (“turn the volume up,” “turn on closed captioning”). I like the flexibility. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Apple TV Plus button will eventually replace Sling TV on the Voice Remote Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2aFOkg"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro’s built-in microphones did a fine job picking up my voice when on the coffee table several feet away from me; I didn’t have to shout or over-enunciate anything for my voice commands to register successfully. Roku says the “mid-field microphones” can work at distances up to 12 feet, but at that point, you’d probably need to raise your voice some.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8uVFp"&gt;Don’t expect Roku’s voice platform to be a replacement for the Google Assistant or Alexa, though. Aside from opening channels or searching for content, it’s all still rudimentary stuff. You can ask it what the time is, but it can’t give you the weather. “Turn the volume up” worked perfectly on my TCL Roku TV, but “turn the brightness down” didn’t. Certain apps like Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max can &lt;a href="https://support.roku.com/article/360009552694"&gt;start playing content directly after a voice request&lt;/a&gt;, but “watch&lt;em&gt; The Crown&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix” requires you to click in from the voice search result. (You can say “Hey Roku, OK” to select whatever’s currently highlighted, so you can technically still start watching using only your voice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="p55tAn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VbN9CN"&gt;“Hey Roku, find the remote” easily proved to be my favorite voice command. Assuming the remote is in a spot where it can hear you say that, it’ll emit a sound for 60 seconds or until you press a button to indicate it’s been found. The Roku Ultra has a button on the streaming box itself for this purpose, but this is even easier — assuming you’re okay with the always-on mics. You can also trigger the remote beeping with Roku’s smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xacziY"&gt;Amazon recently announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348578/amazon-ruins-fire-tv-remote-netflix-disney-hulu-buttons"&gt;adding sponsored shortcut buttons to the Fire TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, and that means Roku and Amazon are pretty much identical when it comes to clicker functionality. Both can control your TV’s power and volume, both have the dedicated sponsored buttons. Roku’s Voice Remote Pro pulls ahead with the customizable buttons that Amazon’s remote lacks, however. And Amazon still requires you to press and hold the mic button for Alexa commands; there’s no hands-free option. It’s a bit surprising that Roku beat Amazon to a remote that you can talk to from across the room, though the Fire TV Cube builds hands-free commands into the streaming device itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxvxMurv6zxnr22QOYTFGtxpaRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448508/DSCF3628_Edited.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You get two customizable shortcut buttons that can open any app you want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5LIEG"&gt;Roku’s Voice Remote Pro is being released just after Logitech confirmed that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377015/logitech-discontinues-harmony-universal-remotes"&gt;finished making Harmony remotes&lt;/a&gt;. And in part, these streaming remotes are why; thanks to HDMI-CEC, they can cover enough ground for a lot of people that universal remotes aren’t the essential living room gadgets they were 10 years ago. And TVs are increasingly getting “smarter” with built-in support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple HomeKit, so you can include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4XuWb"&gt;Purely from an ergonomic standpoint, my favorite streaming player remote remains Nvidia’s backlit remote for the Shield TV. Yes, it’s got a Netflix button — but that’s it for sponsored buttons. And Nvidia lets you fully customize what the settings button does. You can decide what a single tap, press and hold, or double press will do. These can be set to open different apps if you want, or you can pick from many other functions. There’s no headphone jack, and Nvidia is still using regular old AA batteries, so Roku still comes out ahead in some ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2ziUE"&gt;The Apple TV remote steers clear of streaming app buttons, but it’s too small, easily lost in the far reaches of the couch, and just not great to use. Google’s remote for the latest Chromecast is simple enough, but the furthest it goes with “customizable” buttons is letting you choose which YouTube app — YouTube, YouTube TV, YouTube Kids, YouTube Music, etc. — the YouTube button will open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyuSSk"&gt;The Voice Remote Pro is the best execution of a Roku remote so far, even if it can’t approach the scope of what a Harmony is capable of. The programmable buttons, private listening, and hands-free voice commands are enough to justify the $29.99 price and upgrade from a standard Roku remote. Not everyone will be comfortable with a remote that’s always listening to them, but with the money you’ll save on batteries, it basically pays for itself.&lt;/p&gt;
