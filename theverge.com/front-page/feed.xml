    <title>Uber drivers in the UK will now get minimum wage and paid vacation after a big court win</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLh3KDcRA0KISrLP3u6D7cMX2qU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977920/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1uiknL"&gt;Uber &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001543151/000155278121000124/e21143_ex99-1.htm"&gt;will classify&lt;/a&gt; around 70,000 drivers in the UK as workers and give them some benefits after losing an appeal at the Supreme Court level in February, following a years-long legal battle over their employment status. Drivers will still not be considered full-time employees, but they will receive a minimum wage, holiday time, and will be enrolled in a pension plan starting on March 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPziZH"&gt;The decision in February was one of the biggest wins yet for drivers, and for gig workers writ large, in the UK. But that victory came just a few months after voters in California approved Prop 22, a ballot measure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;reversed a previous decision to classify drivers as employees&lt;/a&gt;. And despite repeated claims that classifying drivers as employees would make things more expensive for customers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike"&gt;all the major gig economy companies have since raised prices anyway&lt;/a&gt;. Uber, which helped bankroll the effort to pass Prop 22, is now looking &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx8y9x/uber-wants-to-export-prop-22-to-europe"&gt;at making similar moves in the European Union&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E64Tpm"&gt;The case Uber lost in February began all the way back in 2016 when two drivers argued that Uber had too much control over their actions to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be considered their employer. Uber lost but continued to appeal all the way up to the UK Supreme Court, which affirmed the lower-court decisions in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaXctd"&gt;Uber and companies like it have long argued that classifying drivers too rigidly would make it harder for them to work when they wanted, and that flexibility was just as, if not more, important than benefits and other protections afforded by more official employment status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mEFKZ"&gt;In an op-ed published Tuesday in the &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/uber-chief-executive-dara-khosrowhahi-drivers-rights-turning-page-b924529.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evening Standard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said it is “increasingly clear to us that flexibility alone is insufficient, and that it should not come at the expense of social protections.” But he added that he believes “outdated employment laws essentially force that trade-off.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsFBT1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei has a plan to get a bigger cut of 5G, even with its phone sales limited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cglpkfAQTGNKIcIEEPlMzMCaB7I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977880/acastro_190520_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o1pAUQ"&gt;Huawei has a plan to compete in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G&lt;/a&gt; without being able to sell its 5G phones everywhere. Today, the technology company announced that &lt;a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/news/2021/3/huawei-releases-whitepaper-innovation-intellectual-property-2020"&gt;it intends to seek royalties&lt;/a&gt; from companies like Apple and Samsung in exchange for the use of its patents, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/huawei-to-start-demanding-5g-royalties-from-smartphone-giants"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Huawei believes it can strike licensing deals despite sanctions in the US, and it plans to use its earnings to invest even further into research and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVoDTZ"&gt;Huawei obtained patents on new technology during the development of the larger 5G standard — alongside companies like Qualcomm and Ericsson — that are needed for interoperability between different 5G networks, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/huawei-to-charge-royalties-to-smartphone-makers-using-its-5g-tech-.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. “Huawei has been the largest technical contributor to 5G standards,” Huawei’s head of intellectual property rights, Jason Ding, said in a statement.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company intends to charge up to $2.50 per phone that uses its 5G patents. Huawei believes its patent business shouldn’t be impacted by ongoing sanctions, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3TXKw"&gt;The company’s patent earnings are already large. Ding estimates Huawei will earn between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion from patent licensing between 2019 and 2021. Huawei also plans to charge less than other manufacturers like Nokia and Ericsson for access to its 5G standard essential patents (SEPs), according to CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZH7mJ"&gt;Huawei is still banned from doing business in the US by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18216988/white-house-huawei-china-equipment-ban-trump-executive-order"&gt;Department of Commerce&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133631/huawei-china-spying-claims-us-officials-blacklist-5g"&gt;concerns of spying&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s networking technology is also still required to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;removed and replaced&lt;/a&gt; in the US and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322880/uk-bans-huawei-5g-network-infrastructure-trump-administration-pressure"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Aggressively pursuing patent royalties seems like a way to profit off the 5G business Huawei was already building. And with no indication that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22273729/huawei-ceo-ren-zhengfei-biden-trump-us-sanctions"&gt;the Biden administration will renegotiate&lt;/a&gt; with the company or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;reverse the ban&lt;/a&gt;, it might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Maps now shows COVID-19 vaccination locations</title>

  &lt;p id="v3Tryz"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-maps-now-displays-covid-19-vaccination-locations%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F16%2F22334609%2Fapple-maps-facebook-google-covid-19-vaccine-locations" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that Apple Maps has been updated with vaccine locations from VaccineFinder, a site run by Boston Children’s Hospital that provides information on vaccine eligibility and availability. People can search for nearby vaccination sites in Apple Maps or ask Siri, “Where can I get a COVID vaccination?” Over 20,000 locations are now listed, with more to be added in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a phone showing Apple Maps with locations marked as COVID-19 vaccine sites." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXmYci24ul9wSwpsQjnRm0WnxxU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375689/apple_maps_vaccinefinder_vaccine_search_results_03162021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaccination sites in Apple Maps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACXEzW"&gt;Each vaccine site listing in Apple Maps includes the operating hours and contact information for the site, with a link to the provider’s website to find vaccine availability and make an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbwVJ4"&gt;With the new feature, Apple joins a number of other tech companies offering more ways for people to check their eligibility, locate vaccination sites, and get vaccine appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VBOBY8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0iMqDU"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2021/03/15/covid-vaccine-appointment-facebook-instagram-coronavirus-vaccination/4680803001/"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it will be adding VaccineFinder information to its COVID Information Center, showing people when and where they can get vaccinated and providing links to make appointments. The COVID Information Center will also be expanding to Instagram, and the company is working on expanding government and health authority WhatsApp chatbots to help people register for vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xO8sHB"&gt;Google is also offering more ways to find information about vaccination. The company &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/googles-business-messages-helps-the-public-find-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that people can use Business Messages in Google Maps and Google search to contact local pharmacies owned by Albertsons Companies — including Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Vons, Albertsons, Acme, Shaw’s, and Tom Thumb — with questions about vaccine eligibility, availability, and appointment booking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoqfW9"&gt;The US federal government is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326335/biden-white-house-covid-19-vaccine-federal-website"&gt;launch its own vaccine-finding website&lt;/a&gt; by May 1st and has said that all adults in the US will be eligible for a vaccine at that time.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;So far, about 28 percent of adults in the US have received their first vaccine dose, &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft reiterates ‘VR for console is not a focus for us’ following localization bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hWvKtjbkKgvU4bbiAuwpbs6H4Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977570/acastro_180604_1777_xbox_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6ER77"&gt;Microsoft has once again reiterated that VR support for Xbox was not a focus for the company, following reports earlier today that hinted it was working on a VR headset compatible with the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VbMYr"&gt;The rumor first surfaced after &lt;a href="https://it.ign.com/xbox-series-x/179732/news/microsoft-al-lavoro-su-un-headset-vr-per-xbox-gli-indizi-arrivano-dalle-nuove-cuffie-wireless"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN Italy&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that some Italian Xbox users received messages, which translated to “[a]n update for the VR headset is available” and “[u]pdate VR headset,” when connecting the recently released Xbox Wireless Headset to their Xbox Series X or Series S consoles. My colleague, Cameron Faulkner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22325883/microsoft-xbox-wireless-headset-gaming-series-x-s-pc-windows-10-review"&gt;reviewed the Xbox Wireless headset&lt;/a&gt; and did not encounter this pop-up message while using the headset on an Xbox Series X console in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AK4lU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5n48S"&gt;A Microsoft representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “the copy in this error message is inaccurate due to a localization bug,” while again reiterating that “VR for console is not a focus for us at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BO0ywN"&gt;Microsoft has yet to explore the VR space for its Xbox consoles. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17485852/microsoft-xbox-one-no-vr-headset-support-windows-mixed-reality-e3-2018"&gt;pulled back&lt;/a&gt; on plans to support virtual reality headsets for Xbox in 2018, explaining that it wanted to focus “primarily on experiences you would play on your TV.” In late 2019, Xbox boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20987089/xbox-phil-spencer-microsoft-vr-project-scarlet-half-life-alyx"&gt;Phil Spencer tweeted out&lt;/a&gt; that although he played “some great VR games” such as &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx,&lt;/em&gt; console VR was not Xbox’s focus ahead of the Xbox Series X / S release. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard lays off about 50 employees, citing COVID-19’s effects on its esports leagues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-knS_tIIZ4zQfYoNHMqedkeR15M=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977519/The_Gauntlet_Final_Bracket_Day_3__62_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Activision Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXDglQ"&gt;Activision Blizzard on Tuesday said it was laying off about 50 people across various divisions dealing predominantly with live events and esports as part of a restructuring. The company cites the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on both the viability of live productions for its esports leagues and the changing viewership habits of its core audience over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNOwwL"&gt;“Players are increasingly choosing to connect with our games digitally and the e-sports team, much like traditional sports, entertainment, and broadcasting industries, has had to adapt its business due to the impact the pandemic has had on live events,” an Activision Blizzard spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/blizzard-fires-50-people-amid-shift-away-from-live-events?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLEvwT"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, laid-off employees will receive three months’ severance, health benefits for the next 12 months, and $200 gift card to Activision Blizzard’s Battle.net PC platform. The layoffs also include some employees at Activision-owned mobile firm King, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaXp0D"&gt;Activision Blizzard operates two massive esports leagues for two of its most popular franchises, Blizzard’s team shooter &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and Activision’s &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;series. Both leagues had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122974/overwatch-league-season-3-preview-youtube-hero-pool-china-travel"&gt;global, travel-oriented productions&lt;/a&gt; planned for 2020 prior to the pandemic, and both had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505843/overwatch-league-owl-grand-finals-2020-schedule-youtube"&gt;shift pretty much every part of the operation&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276595/call-of-duty-league-cdl-2021-season-preview-johanna-faries-interview"&gt;online-only production and remote competition&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tuZw9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a reaction to the realities of how the leagues are playing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6B7DZX"&gt;“We learned a lot last year in terms of how the leagues can be structured for online play, and we’ll look to carry forward the best practices from that,” Tony Petitti, Activision Blizzard’s president of sports and entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/SB-Blogs/Breaking-News/2021/03/Activision-layoffs.aspx"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Sports Business Journal&lt;/em&gt; in an interview&lt;/a&gt;. “In terms of timing, it’s a reaction to the realities of how the leagues are playing and what resources we need to allocate to best serve the league, owners, teams and fans.” Petitti says the company is nonetheless “really optimistic” that its esports business can grow with a new focus on online production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cA2Hy"&gt;While the company’s esports business may have suffered during the pandemic, Activision Blizzard’s core business is doing remarkably well. The company’s latest quarterly earnings report, &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2020-financial#:~:text=For%20the%20year%20ended%20December,GAAP%20operating%20margin%20was%2034%25."&gt;released last month&lt;/a&gt;, indicated record revenues for 2020 that smashed Wall Street expectations, thanks in large part to the ongoing success of &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty &lt;/em&gt;and its &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; battle royale game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9ojIL"&gt;“In a year filled with adversity our extraordinary employees were determined to provide connection and joy to our 400 million players around the world,” Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick said at the time. “They accomplished this as well as generating record financial results for our shareholders. Under difficult circumstances, but with the same conviction and focus, they will continue to do so in 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93JlsF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 16th, 5:41PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information regarding the $200 Battle.net gift card as part of the laid off employees’ benefits. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot Games investigation says there’s ‘no evidence’ CEO harassed female employee</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n18doO"&gt;Riot Games is closing an investigation into whether CEO Nicolo Laurent harassed or discriminated against former employee Sharon O’Donnell, saying it found “no evidence” of the claim. “After review of the results of the investigation,” Riot said in a statement, “there is no evidence that Nicolo harassed, discriminated, or retaliated against Ms. O’Donnell. The Special Committee has also expressed its full confidence in Nicolo’s leadership, that no action against him is warranted, and that he will continue to operate as CEO.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYQTA5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/03/16/nicolo-laurent-lawsuit-riot-games/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the news earlier today, and Riot &lt;a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/special-committee-review"&gt;posted an overview&lt;/a&gt; of the investigation’s conclusions as well as a letter from Laurent. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Riot asked a court to speed up legal proceedings for a suit filed by O’Donnell earlier this year, attempting to move the case to arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40xp2R"&gt;Riot, the studio behind games like &lt;em&gt;Valorant &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; League of Legends,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275059/riot-games-ceo-investigation-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-allegations"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Laurent following O’Donnell’s lawsuit. A former executive assistant, O’Donnell alleged that Laurent made inappropriate sexual remarks and demeaning comments about her gender. She also alleged that she was fired after refusing sexual advances from the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIxpUe"&gt;Now, based on the findings of an outside legal team, a special committee of the board of directors has concluded those claims were meritless. “This is not a recommendation we take lightly,” the committee said in a statement. “Most cases of this nature are not black and white; they fall into the grey. However, this was not one of those cases. In this case, we were simply unable to find any evidence that would justify a sanction of any kind against Laurent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qitQzp"&gt;The committee members said they would request the case be reopened if new evidence emerged. O’Donnell’s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWT8ux"&gt;These claims against Laurent were part of a much bigger controversy involving Riot’s company culture. Several employees echoed stories about pervasive discrimination and harassment at the studio, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/29/17796238/riot-games-league-of-legends-toxic-sexism-workplace-culture-harassment-apology"&gt;leading Riot to apologize&lt;/a&gt; and promise changes, including &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/esports-lol-riot-gelb/reports-riot-games-suspends-coo-idUSKBN1OD0GS"&gt;suspending the company’s COO&lt;/a&gt; for two months. In addition to the suit from O’Donnell, Riot is &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-01-29-riot-games-seeks-arbitration-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;currently pushing to settle&lt;/a&gt; a class action gender discrimination complaint. A report yesterday &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/news/sources-alienware-terminates-lol-global-sponsorship-allegations-riot-ceo"&gt;suggested that Alienware&lt;/a&gt; had ended a partnership with Riot following the allegations; Riot declined to comment on the claim at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6pVGf"&gt;In its statement, the board committee attempted to separate Laurent’s investigation from a larger mission to change Riot’s culture. “While our conclusion in this particular case is that no discrimination, harassment, or retaliation occurred, let us be clear that as a committee, we remain fully invested in overseeing the Company’s initiatives to transform Riot’s culture,” it said. “We encourage any employee of Riot who has experienced misconduct to feel safe reporting it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Teen ‘mastermind’ behind the great Twitter hack sentenced to three years in prison</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GhMIM04WEo_FwcoWTfeJG30U6-M=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68977098/VRG_ILLO_1777_twitter_bitcoin.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TYfT1j"&gt;Teenage Twitter hacker Graham Ivan Clark has pleaded guilty to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;last summer’s unprecedented bitcoin scam attack&lt;/a&gt; that involved the takeover of dozens of high-profile accounts on the social network, according to paperwork filed in Florida court on Tuesday. Clark, who was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352325/twitter-hack-arrest-go-read-this-new-york-times-profile"&gt;17 when accused of leading the scam&lt;/a&gt;, will spend three years in prison as part of his plea deal. The&lt;em&gt; Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2021/03/16/tampa-twitter-hacker-agrees-to-three-years-in-prison-in-plea-deal/"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ65Ue"&gt;Clark has already been credited with 229 days of time served &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349920/twitter-hack-arrest-florida-teen-fbi-irs-secret-service"&gt;since his arrest last summer&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the deal, Clark is also being sentenced as a “youthful offender,” which lessened his prison time and also opens up the possibility that he can serve some of his sentence at a boot camp, according to the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;. Clark will also be banned from using computers without permission and without supervision from law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="au8Ovg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Clark was 17 at the time of the Twitter hack, which compromised several high-profile accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWeksl"&gt;The hack took place on July 15th, 2020, and it quickly became one of the most fraught cybersecurity incidents in Twitter’s history, as accounts belonging to high-profile users like Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden were compromised in quick succession to promote a bitcoin scam Clark used to accept more than $100,000 in the cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0SIY9"&gt;How Clark pulled off the hack, which he did alongside two other collaborators he allegedly met on an online username-selling forum called OGusers, has been the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21329147/twitter-hack-attack-bitcoin-scam-how-it-happened-new-york-times-go-read-this"&gt;subject of numerous reports&lt;/a&gt; that detailed the group’s use of internal Twitter tools. Those tools, which can be used to reset account email addresses, allowed Clark and his collaborators to assume control of the accounts and send out tweets soliciting the public for bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMfcKF"&gt;Shortly after the hack, Clark was arrested at his home in Hillsborough, Florida. Clark’s partners, Nima Fazeli of Orlando and Mason Sheppard of the UK, were charged with federal crimes, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wikimedia will launch a paid service for big tech companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo of Wikipedia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tB4OKgNk0nIVTQsn4ep06qbJZMk=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68976992/1296469702.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Altan Gocher / DeFodi Images via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hxgVf5"&gt;The Wikimedia Foundation is creating a &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise"&gt;new paid service&lt;/a&gt; for companies that draw on Wikipedia data. The foundation announced the news today &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wikipedia-finally-asking-big-tech-to-pay-up/?utm_brand=wired&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;mbid=social_twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;via an article in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s planning to launch later in 2021. &lt;a href="https://enterprise.wikimedia.com/"&gt;Wikimedia Enterprise&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s called, won’t change how current Wikipedia services work. Instead, it will offer new options for companies that use its content, a category including giants like Google and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ew5SeV"&gt;Wikimedia is still finalizing how Wikimedia Enterprise will operate. But broadly, it’s like a premium version of Wikipedia’s API — the tool that lets anybody scrape and re-host Wikipedia articles. Enterprise customers could get data delivered faster or formatted to meet their needs, for instance, or get new options for sorting and posting it. As Wikimedia Foundation senior director Lane Becker explains to &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, companies may already be paying employees to clean up Wikipedia data, and Enterprise will do that kind of cleanup at the source. Or if they want, companies can keep using the existing API for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="srrWKD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wikimedia insists it’s not “forcing Big Tech to pay”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nI99s6"&gt;Many huge internet services are powered partly by Wikipedia. Google’s “knowledge boxes” incorporate information from the free encyclopedia, and so do voice assistants like Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri. As web platforms attempt to fight misinformation, Wikipedia has also become a go-to fact-checking resource. But while some companies have &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/amazon-echo-wikipedia-wikimedia-donation.html"&gt;offered donations&lt;/a&gt; in return for using Wikimedia’s free services, others have launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17120918/youtube-wikipedia-conspiracy-theory-partnerships-sxsw"&gt;big Wikipedia-powered initiatives&lt;/a&gt; without even telling the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEngot"&gt;Wikimedia’s &lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise/FAQ"&gt;frequently asked questions page&lt;/a&gt; insists that Enterprise isn’t “forcing Big Tech to pay” for Wikipedia. But it &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;solve specific, well-known problems for those companies. One potential service would let companies display the most reliably community-vetted edits instead of the newest ones, preventing false or insulting vandalized articles from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-search-california-gop-nazism/"&gt;ending up on their own platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gDbwK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Enterprise/Essay"&gt;In an essay&lt;/a&gt;, the Wikimedia Enterprise team acknowledges that it’s balancing commercial realities with a mission to provide free access to knowledge. “This is about setting up the movement to thrive for decades to come, to weather any storm, and to genuinely stand a chance at achieving the mission first conceived 20 years ago,”  the essay says. “We’re going to need more resources, more partners, and more allies if we are going to achieve the goals implicit in our vision statement.” And starting later this year, that could include paid partnerships with the internet’s biggest companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZiH55y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mars might be hiding most of its old water underground, scientists say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrsyMmhsQcxrRJ5vRdC65EHQE-M=/0x56:1602x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68976337/25695_PIA24485_K4_ZCAM_main_sol004_Delta_Remnant_unannotated.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A deposit of sediments, called a delta, captured by NASA’s Perseverance rover on March 5th at the Jezero Crater.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HbAndJ"&gt;Vast amounts of ancient Martian water may have been buried beneath its surface instead of escaping into space, scientists report in the journal &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;. The findings, published Tuesday, may help untangle a clash of theories seeking to explain the disappearance of Mars’ water, a resource that was abundant on the planet’s surface billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r88HBW"&gt;Through modeling and data from Mars probes, rovers, and meteorites, researchers at the California Institute of Technology found that a broad range — between 30 to 99 percent — of the Red Planet’s earliest amounts of water could have vanished from the surface through a geological process called crustal hydration, where water was locked away in the rocks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;of Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqHsNP"&gt;Evidence of past water on Mars is written all over its rocky surface, where dried-out lake beds and rock formations illustrate a world shaped by liquids from more than 3 billion years ago. For years, scientists thought this water had mostly escaped outward into space, leaving the planet in its present — very dry — condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqvoxA"&gt;But that takes time. And the rate at which the water could have escaped the atmosphere, paired with the predicted amount of water that once existed on the Martian surface didn’t quite line up with modern observations of the planet. “If that persisted through the past 4 billion years, it can only account for a small fraction of water loss,” says Renyu Hu, one of the study’s co-authors. That left researchers with a key question: where exactly did the rest of the water on Mars go? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dyxpdi"&gt;The study, led by Eva Scheller, a graduate student in geology at Caltech studying planetary surface processes, might offer an answer. The study finds that most of the water loss occurred during Mars’ Noachian period between 3.7 billion to 4.1 billion years ago. During that time, the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;water on Mars could have interacted and fused&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with minerals in the planet’s crust — in addition to escaping the planet’s atmosphere&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;locking away as much water as roughly half of the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kO6x_Forl0UgJOPSe7WOMvdTMwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375099/_mars.nasa.gov_msl_raw_images_proj_msl_redops_ods_surface_sol_03052_opgs_edr_ncam_NLB_668441769EDR_F0870792NCAM00252M_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image of the Mont Mercou cliff, captured by one of the navigation cameras aboard NASA’s Curiosity rover this month. Data and images from Curiosity informed the findings made by Scheller’s team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BoeFba"&gt;“One of the things our team realized early in the study is that we needed to pay attention to the evidence from the last 10 to 15 years of Mars exploration in terms of what was going on with our discoveries about the Martian crust, and in particular the nature of water in the Martian crust,” says Bethany Ehlmann, a co-author on the study and professor of geological and planetary sciences at Caltech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN7GfB"&gt;Water can break down rocks through a process called chemical weathering, which sometimes results in minerals becoming hydrated. Hydrated minerals take up and store water, locking it away. For example, gypsum, a water-soluble mineral found naturally on Mars, can keep its water trapped unless heated at temperatures higher than 212 degrees Fahrenheit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUKjXj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The answers are there, but they slowly build through time as you gain more data”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fO0Ubb"&gt;For years, scientists have observed the distribution of water-bearing minerals across the Martian surface, thanks to spacecraft like NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been mapping the planet’s geology and climate since 2006. But those views alone are sometimes limited. “You have to wave your hands and extrapolate about how thick that layer is that you see at the surface,” says Michael Meyer, the lead scientist for NASA’s Mars Exploration Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8RKYaZ"&gt;“It’s only by having measurements in particular places on the surface with your rovers or landers, like Phoenix, or your occasional view of a fresh crater, that you get an idea of how thick the particular spot is on the planet for the hydrated minerals that you’re looking at,” he says. “So the answers are there, but they slowly build through time as you gain more data.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wumzyg"&gt;That’s what led to the study’s findings that oceans’ worth of ancient water may have escaped inward, not outward. “We wanted to understand this at different scales,” says Scheller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwOue2"&gt;Crustal hydration happens on Earth, but our active plate tectonic system recycles rock deep inside our planet, heating rocks and releasing water in the process. That water gets sent back to the surface through volcanic activity, says Christopher Adcock, a planetary geochemist at the University of Nevada Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYquEo"&gt;Mars, on the other hand, is not as geologically active as Earth, which could explain why it only has limited water on its surface. The clearest evidence of water on Mars comes in the form of ice at the planet’s poles and in tiny quantities in the atmosphere. Scientists have studied hydrated rocks on the Moon, Mars, and on other planetary bodies as a potential source of drinkable water for future astronaut missions or fuel that could power habitats and rockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjwJMI"&gt;Adcock, whose studies include how humans can synthesize and use minerals on Mars for drinking water and rocket fuel, says the findings from Scheller’s team don’t totally change the game for resource utilization, “but it is certainly an encouraging reminder that the water we need for long term human missions to Mars might be right at our feet when we get there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlzHkq"&gt;Last month, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; its Perseverance rover on Mars’ Jezero Crater, the site of a dried-out lake bed whose soil might hold the most pristine evidence of hydrated minerals — and fossilized microbial life. Perseverance will scoop up tiny soil samples and scatter them across the crater’s surface for a future “fetch” rover to retrieve. That presents a tantalizing opportunity for the researchers behind the &lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt; study.&lt;/p&gt;
