    <title>T-Mobile’s long-promised 5G home broadband will launch later this month</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile hopes to expand the service to 7 to 8 million customers in the next five years | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d8ZTO1"&gt;At an analyst event on Thursday, T-Mobile revealed that its long-awaited 5G home broadband service will launch later this month, which it confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; A 4G version of the service is currently in pilot testing with 100,000 households. By the end of the year, T-Mobile says it hopes to extend the service to 7–8 million customers within five years. There’s no confirmed launch date for the service yet, but we’ll know more later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCrFgl"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254853/tmobile-sprint-merger-5g-home-internet-service-promises"&gt;promising 5G-based wireless broadband&lt;/a&gt; since before its acquisition of Sprint, saying that the merger would make it possible to offer service that would challenge the dominant cable companies. Before the deal was approved, T-Mobile went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275640/tmobile-lte-wireless-home-internet-service-pilot-launch"&gt;started testing out the service&lt;/a&gt; with a limited group of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0z9D8s"&gt;The self-styled Uncarrier isn’t the only one testing the waters of fixed wireless internet. Verizon &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fnews%2Fc-band-verizon-expands-5g-home-internet&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325833%2Ft-mobile-5g-home-broadband-internet-launch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just expanded&lt;/a&gt; its 5G home internet service to ten more cities, though in testing last year &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/for-now-verizons-5g-home-internet-service-offers-very-little-coverage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that actual availability in the cities Verizon serves is scarce. If nothing else, both companies seem plenty motivated to get 5G home internet up and running. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go listen to Spotify’s podcast about itself that ignores the existence of iTunes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GIvgSm29-LauAgtAIsyOvUcNsoQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951861/mdoying_180308_1437_0082still.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L1vT9P"&gt;Spotify is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-11/introducing-the-new-miniseries-spotify-a-product-story/"&gt;making a podcast about its own history&lt;/a&gt;, and the first two episodes are well worth a listen for the details on the jump from piracy to streaming, how the company decided to build its business, and the technical details of how it did so. There are also some fun interviews included, with the podcast featuring stories from Sean Parker, inventor of Napster, and Lars Ulrich of Metallica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjakdV"&gt;In the podcast, the Spotify founders discuss the history of piracy in Spotify’s home country, Sweden, to give context about its development environment. It goes into the existence of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party_(Sweden)"&gt;Sweden’s Pirate Party&lt;/a&gt;, an actual political party that once held several seats in the country’s parliament. The founders also discuss how they wanted to take the ease of pirating music but make it legitimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hto6JX"&gt;If talk about being easier than piracy sounds familiar, it’s probably because that was part of the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theledger.com/news/20130424/happy-anniversary-itunes-celebrates-a-decade-faces-new-challenges"&gt;iTunes Music Store, too&lt;/a&gt;. It seems, for the most part, that iTunes and the iPod are pretty much completely ignored. The podcast presents music distribution as going from CD stores to Napster to Spotify. Apple and Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/17/18268861/spotify-apple-antitrust-fight-latest-updates-news"&gt;aren’t the best of friends&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s honestly somewhat hilarious to hear how the story completely ignores the fact that people could, in fact, buy digital music (an option that was around even before Spotify launched).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHyG4f"&gt;Despite the lack of objectivity about the history of digital music, the technical depth alone makes it well worth a listen. The second episode (labeled 01) gets into how Spotify used the same peer-to-peer tech used by the pirates to build its legitimate music streaming service and how its approach blew people's minds at the time. Even though the story leaves some pretty important parts out, &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/3L9tzrt0CthF6hNkxYIeSB"&gt;it’s still worth a listen&lt;/a&gt; to hear the origins of the popular music (and, obviously, podcasting) service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pakistan is again banning TikTok, this time for ‘peddling vulgarity’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ufLIkvf3ZyakkULTvro5-1pWqgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951763/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hGrOzk"&gt;Pakistan has banned TikTok yet again, citing objectionable content on the shortform video app. This is the second time the ByteDance platform has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509817/tiktok-pakistan-ban-immoral-indecent-content"&gt;banned in Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, following a brief 10-day shutdown in October of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONMcK"&gt;Last fall, TikTok was banned for hosting “immoral” and “indecent” videos, but the company was able to assure the Pakistani government that videos would be moderated “in accordance with societal norms and the laws of Pakistan,” and the app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523094/pakistan-tiktok-ban-lifted-after-10-days"&gt;resumed operations&lt;/a&gt; a week and a half later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kgMTQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App. During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.&lt;/p&gt;— PTA (@PTAofficialpk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PTAofficialpk/status/1370044117678444544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4pyxu"&gt;The company has tens of millions of users in Pakistan, and yet a high court in the city of Peshawar ordered the government’s telecom regulatory body, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority, to ban the app in order to comply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOV0rz"&gt;“In respectful compliance to the orders of the Peshawar High Court, PTA has issued directions to the service providers to immediately block access to the TikTok App,” reads the announcement. “During the hearing of a case today, the PHC has ordered for the blocking of App.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnTr1J"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why TikTok’s legality in Pakistan is again in question and whether any one video or trend on the app is the culprit. Yet, &lt;a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/11/pakistani-court-orders-tik-tok-banned-over-obscene"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Al Jazeera&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that complaints were made from Peshawar High Court Chief Justice Qaiser Rashid Khan, who accused TikTok of hosting content “unacceptable for Pakistani society.” &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/90df50e4-7fd9-4def-86e3-db256882140d"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Khan said the platform engaged in “peddling vulgarity” and ordered the ban take effect immediately during a hearing on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n1gtY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second ban for TikTok in Pakistani in the last year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9vyZs6"&gt;“TikTok is built upon the foundation of creative expression, with strong safeguards in place to keep inappropriate content off the platform,” TikTok said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “In Pakistan we have grown our local-language moderation team, and have mechanisms to report and remove content in violation of our community guidelines. We look forward to continuing to serve the millions of TikTok users and creators in Pakistan who have found a home for creativity and fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wCZ8I"&gt;TikTok has endured a number of contentious government bans and other restrictions around the world — most notably, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;countrywide ban in India since last summer&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22160239/tiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department"&gt;hamfisted attempt&lt;/a&gt; to force the company to partner with a US tech firm to assuage fears of Chinese government influence over the platform. (That deal, with cloud giant Oracle, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;apparently on life support&lt;/a&gt; under President Joe Biden.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OJcgI"&gt;The app has faced its most serious opposition in and around Southeast Asia, where governments have extended existing control over the media to the video-centric social network using laws and regulations around what constitutes obscene or immoral content. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gogo’s 5G network launch has stalled due to the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gogo in-flight internet STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHETWhF_mED3GtwchqDhx2yO6nE=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951586/gogo-internet-logo-stock1_1020.1419980305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gogo in-flight internet STOCK&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t5p29N"&gt;Gogo will be delaying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18644707/gogo-5g-network-planes-developing-in-flight"&gt;the rollout of its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, pushing it back from 2021 to 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/gogo-delays-5g-launch-due-to-chipset-shortages/d/d-id/768025"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;LightReading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the global chip shortage is to blame for the delay, though Gogo didn’t provide any direct details about how the shortage was setting it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZONve"&gt;Gogo isn’t the only one feeling the sting of the global chip shortage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227040/nvidia-amd-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-3070-3060-ti-3090-rx-6800-xt"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, CPUs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;game consoles&lt;/a&gt; have become infamous for being in short supply, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;car manufacturers are having to slow down production lines&lt;/a&gt; because of the supply constraint. The situation has gotten to the point where President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;has signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for a review of the chip supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBl0iq"&gt;The company, known for providing in-flight Wi-Fi, had a difficult 2020: it did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350251/gogo-layoffs-furloughs-airlines-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;several rounds of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, pay cuts, and furloughs, as people stopped taking flights. The company also ended up selling its commercial in-flight Wi-Fi business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410368/gogo-sells-inflight-internet-business-intelsat-bankrupt"&gt;to a bankrupt satellite provider&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it slightly unclear as to what the company plans to do with its 5G network when it eventually gets it rolled out. The company &lt;a href="https://business.gogoair.com/solutions/midsize-heavy-jet/"&gt;still provides internet and in-flight entertainment&lt;/a&gt; for smaller, more business-oriented planes, so it’s possible it’ll use the network to improve that service. Gogo wasn’t immediately available to comment on its future plans for the network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3w42"&gt;The 5G network, when Gogo gets it rolled out, will be &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/mobile/5g/gogo-goes-all-american-for-5g-network/d/d-id/755064"&gt;an upgrade to the company’s existing 3G cellular towers&lt;/a&gt;. Gogo gave up on its plans of upgrading the network to 4G with equipment from ZTE after the US government basically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/18/17477170/zte-ban-senate-vote-reinstate"&gt;shut down the network equipment provider with a ban&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Game Boy Advance might be the best way to watch Tenet, actually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16DYdN1siI2AgwHGsj1F-hmm-N8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951371/tenetgba.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/1370042833608994817/photo/2" target="_blank"&gt;Bob Wulff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uen3aT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, the latest film by director Christopher Nolan, arrived on Blu-ray in December 2020, but now it has been released in another physical format: Game Boy Advance cartridges. Via &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenet-game-boy-advance-bob-wulff-christopher-nolan-202848161.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4od1AdB8e4"&gt;YouTuber Bob Wulff&lt;/a&gt; managed to fit the two-hour, 30-minute time-bending film with a nearly incomprehensible plot on five cartridges, compressed down to a 192 x 128 resolution that looks blurry even on the GBA’s 240 x 160 display. The worst (best) part of the experience might be that it runs at six frames per second. They even made bespoke labels for each cartridge that are, actually, very well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRRdlu"&gt;Now, before you ask aloud “why?” just say “thank you, Bob Wulff!” instead. This obviously doesn’t need to exist, but the promise of these little displays of technical prowess applied in strange, delightful ways is what gets me out of bed each morning. Plus, it’s fun to imagine Christopher Nolan realizing that there’s a fate far worse than streaming services for his IMAX films to end up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqWEFh"&gt;You can watch the video above to see how they did this. But, you know what? Why watch YouTube videos on &lt;em&gt;YouTube&lt;/em&gt;? That’s passé. Wulff turned the video above &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/1370047156938227722"&gt;into a ROM download&lt;/a&gt; that you can load into a GBA emulator, like mGBA, to name one of many examples you can get on a Windows PC. Come on, you know you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAIvML"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile plans to turn up 5G speed this year, cover 90 percent of Americans with fast 5G by 2024</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1ALIQN-zGC7S5F5hxvsqxiV0yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951303/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile is keen to stay ahead of the 5G competition | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5066wz"&gt;During its &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/event-details/2021/T-Mobile-Virtual-Analyst-Day/default.aspx"&gt;virtual analyst event&lt;/a&gt; today, T-Mobile outlined &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1370098384816779265?s=20"&gt;some bold plans&lt;/a&gt; for expanding its 5G coverage and speeding up its current offerings. The company says that by the end of 2023, it will cover 90 percent of Americans (about 300 million) with what it calls Ultra Capacity 5G (its faster mid-band and mmWave service). It also plans to cover 97 percent of Americans (approximately 320 million) by the end of 2022 with its slower low-band 5G, which it calls Extended Range. Currently, 125 million are covered by Ultra Capacity, with Extended Range covering 287 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHYsUO"&gt;Additionally, those currently covered by Ultra Capacity 5G will see an increase in average speeds from 300Mbps up to 400Mbps, thanks to additional megahertz devoted to 5G, and T-Mobile says that more speed increases are on the way. This portion of T-Mobile’s 5G service is largely based on spectrum &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquired from its Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;, with mid-band frequencies well-suited to faster speeds and broad coverage. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="S1S5xW"&gt;Already having access to those mid-band frequencies allowed T-Mobile to take a less aggressive approach to the recent FCC C-band auction, a fact it celebrated throughout its investor call today. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ft-mobile-further-solidifies-5g-leadership-position-with-successful-c-band-auction&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325857%2Ft-mobile-5g-coverage-ultra-capacity-extended-range" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile says its comparatively low bid&lt;/a&gt; of $9.3 billion (Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T bid $45.4 and $23.4 million, respectively) went toward spectrum that would strategically supplement its current 2.5GHz holdings. Those frequencies will become available in 2023 and likely figure into the latter part of the company’s aggressive expansion plans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this: the fight over YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news site — and a cat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iUQYcKGO6KPnBCX2eosNnoMiyPM=/0x9:3918x2621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68951186/Screen_Shot_2021_03_11_at_12.38.59_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: SCNR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5SqUIW"&gt;YouTube drama remains some of the most interesting drama, and &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on infighting at political YouTube creator Tim Pool’s news company — and the fate of a cat named Betsy — is no exception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uccKyG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;’s Will Sommer sets the scene with Pool’s background as a former &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reporter who went independent as an alt-right-adjacent YouTube creator. But the meat of the report is the fight over Subverse, a news media &lt;a href="https://scnr.com/"&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SCNRtv/featured"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; (renamed SCNR for a hilarious reason you should read the report to learn) for which Pool and his former business partner, Emily Molli, raised over $1 million to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBaUre"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7URS4gFQFGw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0vV4A"&gt;Molli was joined by another &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;alum, Rocco Castoro, to get the YouTube operation off the ground, and the resulting videos feel a lot like &lt;em&gt;Vice’s &lt;/em&gt;own documentary work. But then problems arose. “Tensions between Pool and his other partners flared...over who had access to various internal systems connected to Subverse,” writes Sommer. Those tensions would lead to Castoro and Molli investigating Pool for “unsavory internet schemes” and leave Betsy, Molli’s cat, allegedly held hostage at Pool’s mansion in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObTlei"&gt;You should read &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/youtube-star-tim-pools-news-site-collapses-amid-allegations-he-took-a-cat-hostage?ref=scroll"&gt;Sommer’s report on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for the complicated journey Betsy took to get back to Molli. But for now, remember: never let your cat go to a second location with a YouTube creator / podcaster.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fA86QY2DKSwH07ZT7beT5FHyO3Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950940/acastro_180130_1777_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8u8rBK"&gt;Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent. Lancaster apparently did this in hopes of gaining publicity for his next venture after leaving Apple. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/11/apple-sues-former-employee-over-device-leaks-to-media"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported on the legal filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nWQN"&gt;“Tens of thousands of Apple employees work tirelessly every day on new products, services and features in the hopes of delighting our customers and empowering them to change the world. Stealing ideas and confidential information undermines their efforts, hurting Apple and our customers,” commented Apple in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We take very seriously this individual’s deliberate theft of our trade secrets, violation of our ethics and our policies, all for personal gain. We will do all we can to protect the innovations we hold so dear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbXqLk"&gt;According to Apple’s suit, Lancaster and his correspondent began communicating in 2018 about the possibility of obtaining information; the two then spent the next year in communication. Lancaster then reportedly contacted his correspondent in spring 2019, asking him to investigate rumors of a potential Apple product that could “mean trouble for my startup.” The lawsuit also claims that Lancaster boasted to a third party shortly after that conversation that his media contact would be writing a story on his startup if it hit $1 million in funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpnIE4"&gt;In October 2019, Lancaster reportedly notified his correspondent that he was planning to leave Apple, giving over secret information on Apple products and asking if they wanted “to write a story about a 12-year Apple Design Veteran leaving for an amazing startup?” The correspondent also allegedly asked Lancaster to get additional information on an unannounced project that Apple refers to as “Project X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0Uz1"&gt;Lancaster then submitted his notice of resignation to Apple on October 15th, but kept chatting with his media source — the next day, they allegedly asked for specific documents they wanted Lancaster to get before he left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDRJhH"&gt;Apple also alleges that Lancaster specifically attended a meeting about “Project X” even after he had submitted his resignation notice, specifically to get more information to pass along to his media contact, despite the fact that he had been instructed by other employees not to attend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSZRmH"&gt;The company also claims that Lancaster used his Apple credentials to download confidential information almost up until his employment ended at midnight on November 1st, 2019. According to Apple, Lancaster logged in from an external location at 10:24PM that day — this time, to get materials that the company says would help his new employer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARMU4S"&gt;Lancaster &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;started working at Apple in 2008&lt;/a&gt; and spent 11 years working at the company, serving as advanced materials lead and product design architect in his final role there &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fpulse%2Fwhy-i-left-apple-joined-arris-composites-simon-lancaster-&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325827%2Fapple-lawsuit-macbook-designer-simon-lancaster-trade-secrets-leaks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;before leaving in 2019&lt;/a&gt; to join Arris Composites, a material design company, as its head of consumer products. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191122005108/en/Simon-Lancaster-Former-Advanced-Materials-Lead-at-Apple-Joins-Arris-Composites-to-Unlock-Future-of-Consumer-Products"&gt;According to a press release&lt;/a&gt; announcing his switch to Arris, Lancaster worked on the 13-inch and 15-inch Macbook Pro with Touch Bar redesigns, along with “unreleased Apple products.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is trying to crack down on password sharing with new test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0cklrAZ9soHWrQX2XLAoqQy9P8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950935/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8NpwLQ"&gt;Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;more than 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; around the world, and now the company is looking at ways to curb password sharing for both business and security reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMuTOM"&gt;A new feature, &lt;a href="https://gammawire.com/netflix-to-start-testing-warnings-for-people-borrowing-login-info/"&gt;first spotted by &lt;em&gt;GammaWire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prevents people who are not authorized to use the account from accessing it. A Netflix spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so.” If Netflix detects that someone is trying to use the account without being an account owner, they’ll be asked to verify later or verify being an account owner through an email code or text code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jWSpB"&gt;If someone is unable to verify account ownership within a certain timeframe, they won’t be able to stream any Netflix content. Instead, they’ll be asked to make their own account. While this may not prevent all password sharing — hypothetically, an account owner could send their friend the code as it comes through — the idea is that it will prevent some password sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2cglF"&gt;The test, which isn’t specific to any one country for any specific length of time, is also being rolled out to try to better security measures around account protection. If there’s a malicious attempt to use an account for which someone may have gained a password through fraudulent methods, they won’t be able to access the account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rLEisr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This test is designed to help ensure that people using Netflix accounts are authorized to do so”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kZNYqc"&gt;One of the biggest questions Netflix subscribers might have is what constitutes a household account. Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://help.netflix.com/legal/termsofuse"&gt;terms of service state&lt;/a&gt; that streaming content on the platform is “for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with individuals beyond your household.” That may mean a physical household, but the terms of service aren’t super clear. Families with kids away at college or living in different states may sign up for the family plan, for example. That’s one scenario that co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/17/your-shared-netflix-password-is-safe-the-ceo-says.html"&gt;specifically spoke about in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="844ppc"&gt;“Password sharing is something you have to learn to live with,” Hastings said. “There’s so much legitimate password sharing, like you sharing with your spouse, with your kids, so there’s no bright line, and we’re doing fine as is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxsF9"&gt;Now, however, it seems like Netflix’s teams are trying to figure out a way to combat some password sharing while also addressing tighter security measures. Password sharing has long been a concern posed by analysts and investors in the space. Analysis from Parks Associates estimated that password sharing and piracy cost companies in the &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/01/13/password-sharing-denies-streaming-services-9-billion-in-fees-report/"&gt;streaming space around $9 billion alone&lt;/a&gt;. While Hastings alongside other entertainment executives have shrugged it off as something that companies have to contend with, it appears that things are beginning to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJCKtS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox boss says Microsoft’s Bethesda deal was all about exclusive games for Game Pass</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Phil Spencer Microsoft Xbox stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnzpEiGjOyKwGYStemd93xv-p0U=/0x0:3200x2133/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68950635/philspencer2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YqpkAT"&gt;Microsoft completed its $7.5 billion Bethesda acquisition earlier this week and initially hinted that “some new titles in the future” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized"&gt;would be exclusive to Xbox and PC players&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;em&gt;some &lt;/em&gt;language left some wiggle room for the possibility of future Bethesda titles to appear on Sony’s PlayStation 5, Nintendo’s Switch, or elsewhere. Now, Microsoft’s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, is making it very clear why the company paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda: Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0iTHt"&gt;Speaking during a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YJneU_qBMPM"&gt;Bethesda and Xbox roundtable&lt;/a&gt; event today, Spencer revealed that Xbox Game Pass is at the heart of this Bethesda deal. “If you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists,” said Spencer. “That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0YAlh"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;not a surprising admission&lt;/a&gt;, as it has been obvious Microsoft has been gearing up for a different kind of Xbox future with its Xbox Game Pass subscription push. But hearing it directly from the head of Xbox makes it even clearer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336892/microsoft-xbox-series-x-game-pass-event-showcase-future"&gt;Xbox Game Pass is Microsoft’s true next-gen Xbox&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="prYfiL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox chief Phil Spencer on exclusive Bethesda games: "This is about delivering great exclusive games for you [Xbox customers] that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists." &lt;a href="https://t.co/K1U84pukdu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/K1U84pukdu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1370079409118588931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQQd5o"&gt;This doesn’t mean Bethesda games will suddenly disappear from other platforms. In fact, it’s the opposite. “There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances,” says Spencer. “We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6IY8TT"&gt;Microsoft and Bethesda only cleared the deal recently, so it’s too early for any game announcements, but questions remain over Bethesda’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447792/bethesda-starfield-new-series-announced-e3-2018"&gt;new and upcoming &lt;em&gt;Starfield &lt;/em&gt;title&lt;/a&gt; and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226966/bethesda-indiana-jones-game-machinegames"&gt;recently announced Indiana Jones game&lt;/a&gt;. Will these both be exclusive to Xbox and PC? We simply don’t know yet. Spencer did mention that “even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do,” so there &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;potentially be new Bethesda games appearing on non-Microsoft platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWLVmu"&gt;What’s clear is that the long-term goal is for Bethesda to create exclusive games that will only be available on platforms where Xbox Game Pass is supported. At the moment, that’s Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android phones, and soon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;iOS devices via the web&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptC6Gj"&gt;Here’s Spencer’s full statement on Bethesda exclusivity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cyvpZP"&gt;So obviously I can’t sit here and say every Bethesda game is exclusive, because we know that’s not true. There’s contractual obligations that we’re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances. We have games that exist on other platforms, and we’re gonna go support those games on the platforms they’re on. There’s communities of players and we love those communities and we’ll continue to invest in them. And even in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we’ll go do. But if you’re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists. That’s our goal, that’s why we’re doing this, that’s the root of this partnership that we’re building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
