    <title>Twitter adds captions to voice tweets more than a year after they first launched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foo8fxaVSe1QVmIBW-o5TtzioFg=/0x200:1200x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69589056/E6XiiGlWQAYISTV.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captions on a voice tweet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7UAdrN"&gt;Twitter is now rolling out captions for voice tweets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415806764113670145"&gt;the company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter first launched voice tweets &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294481/twitter-audio-tweets-now-available-iphone-ios"&gt;in June 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296032/twitter-audio-tweets-accessibility-volunteers"&gt;quickly criticized at the time&lt;/a&gt; by accessibility advocates for not having captions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W0cfd"&gt;Now, when you make a voice tweet (something you can only do on the iOS app right now), captions will be automatically generated in supported languages, which are English, Japanese, Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, French, Indonesian, Korean, and Italian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npgjyG"&gt;To see the captions on a tweet, you can click or tap the CC icon in the top-right corner of the voice tweet window. Captions only appear on new voice tweets, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;so you won’t see them on older ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLFdhH"&gt;Below is a screenshot of what the captions and the CC icon look like on the web, taken from a voice tweet that I made while writing this article:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YD_udtL0AuyfYaYiESAUCkVZaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720808/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_4.26.51_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6X7WpS"&gt;You can also try to listen to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jaypeters/status/1415814919669260288"&gt;my voice tweet here&lt;/a&gt; and follow along with the captions, though I will warn you that my tweets eventually auto delete. If you’re reading this article a little while after it was published, the voice tweet might be gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOVXE"&gt;When voice tweets launched, it also came to light that there wasn’t a dedicated team at Twitter for accessibility at the time — instead, employees had to volunteer their own time for accessibility work. The company has since fixed that, announcing that it had formed teams &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/making-twitter-more-accessible"&gt;to focus on accessibility&lt;/a&gt; in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8r3sWB"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to make Twitter accessible for everyone, we’re rolling out automated captions for Voice Tweets to iOS,” Twitter’s head of global accessibility Gurpreet Kaur said in a statement. “Though it’s still early and we know it won’t be perfect at first, it’s one of many steps we’re taking to expand and strengthen accessibility across our service, and we look forward to continuing our journey to create a truly inclusive service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FamdOk"&gt;Twitter also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;offers captions in Twitter Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its Clubhouse-like social audio rooms. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is reportedly in talks to buy the $30 billion foundry company AMD spun off a decade ago</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QnbEjP14IxQo_G8xnQoaIGIf9UQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588670/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CQfD9C"&gt;In 2008, chipmakers Intel and AMD took two distinct paths: Intel kept manufacturing its own chips to maintain full control, while AMD decided to spin off its semiconductor business as GlobalFoundries, relying on it and other manufacturers to provide the actual silicon. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-is-in-talks-to-buy-globalfoundries-for-about-30-billion-11626387704"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Intel is looking to snap up AMD’s former fabs as well, in a deal that could value them at $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6mSOK"&gt;It’s clear from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; story that the deal isn’t a sure thing, and GlobalFoundries outright denied that it was in talks with Intel. But it’s possible Intel’s negotiating with the investment firm that owns GlobalFoundries instead, as the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;points out. It’s also intriguing that the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a “no comment” from Intel itself — that’s sometimes a canary to indicate a company &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; comment, just off the record or on deep background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kha7ys"&gt;(“We will decline to comment on rumor and speculation,” an Intel spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; though.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="481eGh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel’s pushing fabs on multiple fronts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcJsmf"&gt;There’s an obvious reason why Intel might want GlobalFoundries — Intel is actually ramping up its foundry business now. In an attempt to turn around the struggling company, new Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;announced in March that Intel would no longer go it alone&lt;/a&gt;, outsourcing more of its chip production to third-party foundries, agreeing to produce more chips for other companies using its own foundries, and also investing in new fabs itself. That included a $20 billion investment in new facilities in Arizona, but it could take many years for new buildings to get constructed and ramp up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RSQWX"&gt;In the meanwhile, it could snap up GlobalFoundries, the #4 foundry in the world (&lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210224-10675.html"&gt;according to TrendForce&lt;/a&gt;), one that accounts for 7 percent of all foundry business by revenue. That won’t put Intel on the same footing as a giant TSMC or Samsung (which together account for an estimated 74 percent), but it’d be a start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Txhn4J"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; took &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/07/making-semiconductors-is-hard/"&gt;a tour of GlobalFoundries’ facility in Malta, NY&lt;/a&gt; just last week, if you’d like to hear what it’s like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey says Square has a new Bitcoin business named TBD</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Conference Draws Cryptocurrency Fans To Miami" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BShgN1xQbTyleYeN-JwvId0M0dY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588606/1321753461.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGA1yN"&gt;Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square, is enough of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;fan of cryptocurrency &lt;/a&gt;that Square’s push into the area won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569309/square-hardware-wallet-bitcoin-jack-dorsey"&gt;at releasing a hardware wallet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company is creating a new business, to go with existing units like Tidal and Cash App, which is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yC2Lf3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like our new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; hardware wallet, we’re going to do this completely in the open. Open roadmap, open development, and open source. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@brockm&lt;/a&gt; is leading and building this team, and we have some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765943385563139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHSWHW"&gt;What does that mean exactly? Is the new business called TBD, or is the name “to be determined” at a later date? In the words of at least one editor of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I absolutely do not know what he is talking about.” When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Square declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc25hx"&gt;What we do know comes mostly from the unit’s new leader Mike Brock, who confidently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795489954361347"&gt;tweeted out several names of TBD’s founding team&lt;/a&gt;, and says he’s “super excited to return to the world of open source.” Further updates on exactly what TBD is doing should come via Twitter and GitHub accounts. But exactly when those updates might arrive is, well, TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sea4Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; said, we're going to be biasing towards being open and transparent. So we'll be sharing a lot more about our plans in the coming days and weeks. We're also going to be thinking of ways to include the community in our planning. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Brock (@brockm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795491879624705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>England footballer calls out weak response from social platforms after online abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Digital Mural Of The Three Black Footballers Racially Abused After England Lost The Euro’s Final Is Unveiled" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvcslaJxs1CDh0KmJAxTrWZ7NbI=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588368/1328717139.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mural in support of England footballers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka was unveiled in Manchester. The three were targeted with racist abuse online after the Euro 2020 final. | Photo by Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rS8mPr"&gt;Bukayo Saka, a player on England’s national football team said in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWkU6mLLlJ/"&gt;Instagram post Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that social media platforms did not do enough to prevent the racist abuse he and his teammates were subjected to after the team’s loss to Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4814z4"&gt;“To the social media platforms &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/instagram/"&gt;@instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;@twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/facebook/"&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt; I don’t want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me Marcus and Jadon have received this week,” Saka wrote. “I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Saka, who are Black, were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the UEFA Euro 2020 championship match on July 11th. England ultimately lost, and the players ‘social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;flooded with racist comments and messages&lt;/a&gt; not long after the game ended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIrMbW"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri told a BBC reporter on Wednesday that Instagram had mistakenly marked some of the comments aimed at the players that used monkey emojis as benign “which they are absolutely not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxUMk2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have technology to try and prioritize reports, and we were mistakenly marking some of these as benign comments, which they are absolutely not. The issue has since been addressed, and the publication has all of this context.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1415335234300690433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzdNQJ"&gt;Twitter said Monday it had removed more than 1,000 tweets and suspended some users for violating its policies against harassment and hateful content; Facebook said it had suggested using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;Instagram’s hidden words tool&lt;/a&gt; to remove the objectionable comments from being visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mLbl"&gt;But as Saka wrote in his post, he knew the hateful posts were coming, yet Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social platforms typically seem to be in reaction mode when incidents like this occur, rather than taking steps to prevent abuse from happening in the first place. It was unfortunately not hard to predict that there would be racist reactions after the end of the match: Throughout the UEFA tournament, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/13/england-players-take-knee-wembley-euro-2020-boos-applause"&gt;fans at Wembley Stadium had booed&lt;/a&gt; their home team when players kneeled before games as an anti-racism protest. England &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/03/gareth-southgate-england-fans-boos-taking-knee"&gt;manager Gareth Southgate said last month&lt;/a&gt; that fans booing England players kneeling before a friendly match against Austria felt like it was critical of the team’s Black players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xdbxv"&gt;It shouldn’t be up to the targets of abuse to push for better responses from social platforms, especially when everyone except the platforms themselves seem to know what’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k2ZDZL"&gt;

    <title>How does Valve’s Steam Deck compare to the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNfDx1Hfn0R18XRJLqtT9tC0jiE=/214x0:2305x1394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588345/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.18.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRbo7Y"&gt;Valve’s surprising &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;new Steam Deck has been officially announced&lt;/a&gt;, promising to let players take their whole Steam library of games on the go. But how does the handheld compare to other major consoles on the market, like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X / S, and the PlayStation 5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvE5q7"&gt;First off, let’s look at the Steam Deck’s specs. It’s powered by an AMD APU with a quad-core / eight-thread Zen 2 CPU and an AMD RDNA 2 GPU with 8 compute units, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOIFE4"&gt;There are three models available: one with 64GB of eMMC storage for $399, one with a 256GB NVMe SSD for $529, and a top-of-the-line model with 512GB of high-speed NVMe SSD storage for $649. While the base eMMC storage configuration could potentially mean slower game installs and load times, Valve promises that “there is no in-game difference in frame rates or graphics quality” among the three models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfugIKRSIDj-WqZfG7PlsaV3eEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719626/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRF0ft"&gt;The most obvious comparison for the Steam Deck is, of course, Nintendo’s Switch — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;particularly the upcoming OLED model&lt;/a&gt; — which offers a similar handheld configuration, screen size, and design. Both devices feature 720p touchscreen displays, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMcabs"&gt;Of the two, the Switch is almost certainly the less powerful device: it features Nvidia’s Tegra X1 chipset, an Arm-based processor that’s over four years old, compared to the Steam Deck’s AMD Zen 2 CPU and next-gen RDNA 2 GPU, architectures that also appear in the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The Steam Deck has also been shown off handling games that the Switch simply can’t, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; (which is only available as a cloud-streamed option on Nintendo’s handheld.) And other showcased games, like &lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;, have never been available in a portable form factor before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O83yQ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More powerful than the Switch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RCwnGv"&gt;But given that the two handhelds are closest together in form factor and price, it’s still worth looking at them side by side — especially considering that even with the gap in performance, they’re far closer to each other than the dramatically more powerful Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNRBql"&gt;Unlike the Switch, the Steam Deck swaps removable controllers for some additional input methods: there’s a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;Steam Controller-style&lt;/a&gt; trackpads on either side of the display, in addition to the thumbsticks, and four extra buttons on the back of the device that serve as paddle-esque additional inputs. It also offers Bluetooth audio for connecting a pair of wireless headphones, something the Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;rather frustratingly lacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Wk23IJhvhbjSZWI6Lt289cXMzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719724/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.19.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V72Gi8"&gt;The Switch does win out in battery life, though, with 4.5 to 9 hours quoted for the Switch OLED, versus 2 to 8 hours on the Steam Deck, with &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-faq-big-questions-answered"&gt;Valve telling &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you can realistically expect 4 hours of &lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; at 720p and 60 frames per second. The Switch is also much lighter than Valve’s portable, weighing in at 0.93 pounds to the Steam Deck’s 1.47-pound weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDXo7X"&gt;Choosing between the $349 OLED Switch and the $399 Steam Deck will largely come down to preference, though: do you prefer Nintendo’s level of polish and lineup of exclusive games, or Valve’s rougher around the edges — but more powerful — option, with its extensive PC gaming library? (The Steam Deck also has other advantages: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;since it’s a full-fledged PC&lt;/a&gt;, you can technically install Windows and leverage it as a portable Xbox Game Pass machine, install the Epic Game Store, and use it for streaming services like Stadia or Luna.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9PtgtJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The PS5 and Xbox Series X win out in virtually every metric&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v2Ohna"&gt;Compared to the lineup of next-gen consoles, like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, the Steam Deck fares considerably worse: its processor is simply no match for the beefier chips in the latest consoles from Sony or Microsoft, and its GPU is markedly less powerful than even the Xbox Series S, with less than half the graphics cores of Microsoft’s weakest next-gen console. Despite the fact that the Steam Deck uses the same RDNA 2 GPU architecture, it’s just not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4eIQ3"&gt;As seen in the chart below, the PS5 and next-gen Xbox consoles win out in almost every metric on which you care to compare them: more cores, faster CPU clock rates, dramatically more compute units, faster GPU clock rates, and more teraflops of raw GPU power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPuwmJ"&gt;And while that may feel like an unfair comparison, it’s worth considering that the Steam Deck — which ranges in price from $399 to $649 — is priced more in the same ballpark as those more premium consoles than the Switch ($199 to $349).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUnV8t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10653941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oYhF3"&gt;A more apt comparison, at least when it comes to predicting the Steam Deck’s approximate power, may be that of the last console generation: at 1.6 teraflops, it slots in neatly between the Xbox One S (1.4 teraflops) and the PS4 (1.8 teraflops) in terms of raw graphical prowess. The Steam Deck does use a more modern RDNA 2 architecture, though, so it’s hard to directly compare the two on specs alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztQAm0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees say the company is cracking down on remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxNmtVq_JC4s00f9NPfwg0RmLZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588204/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than 6,000 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hkEz0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;survey on remote work&lt;/a&gt; conducted by employees in June, 36.7 percent of respondents said they were worried they’d have to leave Apple due to the lack of flexibility (1,735 people answered the question).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBg79W"&gt;The return-to-work plan has already been a flashpoint at Apple, where employees wrote a letter in June asking Apple CEO Tim Cook to reevaluate the hybrid model. Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;sent a video in response&lt;/a&gt; saying that in-person collaboration was “essential” and noting the company would not be backing away from its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1xHzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be out of a job in September”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HielYm"&gt;While Apple’s corporate employees certainly have more flexibility than the retail staff, some say it’s out of step with other big tech companies in Silicon Valley. Twitter and Facebook have already announced a permanent work-from-home policy, and Apple employees say they’ve been flooded with recruiting messages from other tech organizations eyeing a potential opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld1Cht"&gt;One employee said they were currently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation that allowed them to work from home, but were told that accommodation would be denied when the company went back to the office. “I will be out of a job in September,” they wrote in Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jt11t"&gt;Apple typically gives employees 30 days to find a new job within the company if their current team denies a medical accommodation. But one worker said in Slack that there weren’t any open remote positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBKN7"&gt;Some employees say they were told only people with documented medical conditions would be approved for permanent remote work. But the form that Apple employees use to request such an accommodation asks them to release their medical records to the company, which made some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6QlI"&gt;Now, employees are discussing how to get Apple’s attention. Some suggested writing another letter to reiterate their concerns, while others have discussed talking to lawyers about possible legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToWXQ8"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato announces new Stream Deck the same day Valve announces new Steam Deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Er4refyJyMUgG4zfZktVZjou9E=/8x0:2660x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587965/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.39.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elgato’s new Stream Deck, which is different from Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oVk4r"&gt;Elgato’s Stream Deck is a popular tool for live-streamers, letting them set shortcuts and controls they can access with the push of a button, and the company announced a new model on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;the Stream Deck MK. 2&lt;/a&gt;. This version brings a host of welcome improvements, including a detachable stand, interchangeable faceplates, and a removable USB-C cable. You can &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;order it right now on Elgato’s website for $149.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKi4m"&gt;While the Stream Deck MK. 2 does seem like a nice upgrade, it was announced on perhaps the worst possible day. Just a few hours ago, Valve made a huge splash by revealing its new handheld gaming console called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Preowc"&gt;While they’re entirely different products, there’s sure to be some confusion about the names “Stream Deck” versus “Steam Deck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cT7qrx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;amazing that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@valvesoftware&lt;/a&gt; announced steam deck just hours before &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elgato&lt;/a&gt; announced their new stream deck. i'm gettin eyestrain just THINKIN about these press releases &lt;a href="https://t.co/DJKSCxT6UM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DJKSCxT6UM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tim rogers (@108) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/108/status/1415756755192193027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kSLJy"&gt;Alongside the &lt;s&gt;Steam&lt;/s&gt; Stream Deck, Elgato also revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22568273/elgato-facecam-webcam-price-features-streaming-1080p"&gt;streamer-friendly Elgato Facecam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415751930471608320"&gt;Wave XLR USB audio interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415752902694498305"&gt;new mic arms&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R68153-XRoa5BoWJIJh8sqfNMEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587843/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDRprS"&gt;Google is launching a new privacy feature for search that lets you instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history on mobile, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The new option &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other search and Chrome improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io"&gt;at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; and is now rolling out to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19UyiI"&gt;The option to delete your last 15 minutes of search history is currently only available in Google’s iOS app and is headed to Android later this year. On desktop, your options for deleting searches are limited to setting your history to auto-delete every three, 18, or 36 months (18 months is the default for new accounts), or deleting searches by hand. You can see what the new option looks like in the iOS app below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dwpayVPtzvPEZDPR9OTuI1UmdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720317/QUICK_DELETE.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deleting the last 15 minutes of your Google search life is as simple as tapping one button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3tpLT"&gt;Google says it only tracks your search history to “personalize” your experience when the “Web and App Activity” setting is enabled. Adding a way to instantly delete your history is great for your peace of mind, but it also means you can get some of the benefits the people who’ve taken the time to mess with their settings receive, without doing the extra work. Think of it as an emergency “oh no” button for terrible, embarrassing, or just plain private searches. If you’d rather just secure your searches from prying, non-Google eyes rather than delete them, Google also offers the option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452122/google-my-activity-page-password-privacy-verification-web-and-app-history"&gt;to password protect your search history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Old memes are Bill Murray, dodging them is Tilda Swinton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“The French Dispatch” Photocall - The 74th Annual Cannes Film Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XnSXcUNROPbPrOwH-4IAN408Rm4=/0x166:4681x3287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587829/1328503506.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the photos from this Cannes photo shoot has been widely memed. Please make it stop. | Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVY1MR"&gt;Twitter said Thursday it was hearing from users who were seeing too many topic suggestions in their home timelines and was moving to remedy the situation. “We’re fixing that now, and will continue to improve Topics and find ways to show you the very best of Twitter. Things you want to see, that is,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415757630836981764"&gt;Support account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. To its credit, Twitter has seemed more responsive to users’ complaints — or their lack of interest — of late; in addition to Thursday’s topics announcement, Twitter said this week it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;kill off Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its ephemeral disappearing tweets that apparently no one was using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZqvgt"&gt;But instead of showing us more things we want to see, I think Twitter should lean into taking away things we don’t want. I have a suggestion that I think most of the internet will be able to get behind — and we know the internet never collectively agrees on anything, so hear me out here: a way to block memes that are past their expiration date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tihjzw"&gt;This request is inspired by the meme-ified photo of Wes Anderson, Timothée Chalamet, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray from the Cannes Film Festival. It’s meant to promote their movie &lt;em&gt;The French Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, but since we (the internet) have to beat every funny thing into the ground, then dig it up and beat it some more, a version of that meme is now everywhere. Murray represents the “older” end of the spectrum, Swinton is the “cool” one, etc. I’m not going to over-explain it to you. If you know, you know, and explaining memes is probably &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html"&gt;cheugy&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t know, I am Gen X.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9CYRI"&gt; Example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eg4XTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TechCrunch, The Information, The Verge, Techmeme? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL"&gt;https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— alex (@alex) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1415373066658516993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S87JQs"&gt;I’ll refrain from debating the accuracy of the above (it’s correct), but you get the idea. In all seriousness, a “block image” feature would be extremely useful, and not just to reduce the number of annoying memes in our timelines. Twitter has a way to &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/437099/how-to-unblock-potentially-sensitive-content-on-twitter/#:~:text=To%20disable%20the%20warning%2C%20head,disable%20the%20warning%20for%20tweets."&gt;block “sensitive media,”&lt;/a&gt; but it would be great if there were a toggle for specific images — maybe ones that are potentially triggering to a given user but not necessarily widely objectionable — rather than a blanket block-all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEm1cX"&gt;For the time being, you’ll just have to continue to grit your teeth through everyone’s “clever” takes on this worn-out meme; it’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Bill%20Murray%22&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;trending topic&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter at the moment. But it’s also beginning to make the rounds on Facebook, which should be the agreed-upon sign that the meme is officially over and we need something new and shiny to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky9EFC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irCGbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
