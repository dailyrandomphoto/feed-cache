    <title>Honeywell Home’s T9 smart thermostat gets HomeKit support, finally</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ja5VDB3HLz37ogW4KpUaRykGvEE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102858/dseifert_190705_3501_5339.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Honeywell Home T9 smart thermostat will now work with Siri and Apple HomeKit.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IxKEaj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703744/honeywell-home-t9-thermostat-review-remote-sensors-price-specs-features"&gt;Honeywell Home T9&lt;/a&gt;, Resideo’s first consumer thermostat to support remote temperature sensors, has finally brought a long-promised feature to its users: HomeKit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT4s7I"&gt;The brand, which is licensed by Resideo and spun out of Honeywell in 2018, already has support for Apple’s smart home system in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/27/13075062/honeywell-thermostat-smart-connected-lyric-t5"&gt;T5 thermostat, also known as Lyric T5&lt;/a&gt;, but that device doesn’t have external sensors. Sensors can help make sure you’re comfortable in the room you’re in, rather than just maintaining the desired temperature where the thermostat is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjSIJr"&gt;As&lt;em&gt; Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor Dan Seifert wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703744/honeywell-home-t9-thermostat-review-remote-sensors-price-specs-features"&gt;in his review of the Honeywell T9&lt;/a&gt;, its sensors are very good and able to measure humidity in addition to temperature, something neither Nest nor Ecobee’s remote sensors can do. They can also sense motion and presence and will adjust the system to rooms where it detects people. The &lt;a href="https://www.resideo.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/wifi-thermostats/rcht9610wfsw2003-u-t9-smart-thermostat-with-sensor-rcht9610wfsw2003-u/"&gt;T9 costs $199&lt;/a&gt; and comes with one remote sensor in the box, with support for up to 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDU9P2"&gt;According to Resideo, with the HomeKit integration, users can control their Honeywell Home T9 smart thermostat using Siri or with the Apple Home app. Once connected, you can use automations to adjust the temperature or ask Siri to do it for you. Unlike with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22720890/siri-voice-control-ecobee-smart-thermostats"&gt;Ecobee SmartThermostat&lt;/a&gt;, there is no built-in voice assistant, so you need to use a HomePod Mini, iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to invoke the assistant. Resideo didn’t specify if you’ll be able to use temperature or motion from the sensors to trigger routines in the  Home app. The Honeywell Home T9 already has support for Amazon Alexa and Google Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7HkRu"&gt;Whether this really matters, considering smart thermostats are in the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter specification&lt;/a&gt; (the new smart home standard that promises to unify connected devices in our home), remains to be seen. Resideo is on the board of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance,&lt;/a&gt; which oversees Matter, so it seems likely its thermostats will become Matter-enabled when the standard launches next year. This should mean users can control their thermostat with any smart home ecosystem of their choice, as long as it supports Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bequ7m"&gt;But in the meantime, T9 owners will be able to keep their toes toasty this holiday season with just a few words to their Apple voice assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InVWuN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing’s new turnip price tracker doesn’t tell you the most important thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O2KwkW-VE4xrRTBRVc-BYTW3f1k=/25x0:1102x718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102800/IMG_1323.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Turnip Tracker isn’t showing today’s price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s31Bxz"&gt;Nintendo quietly added a turnip price tracker for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;to the Nintendo Switch Online app, but it’s not as useful as I was hoping. Disappointingly, the tracker doesn’t show the current turnip price on your island. Instead, it lists historical prices over the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NV0UX"&gt;To see the tracker, which is cleverly dubbed the Turnip Tracker, you’ll need to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber. If you are, open the Nintendo Switch Online app, tap the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;icon, tap the “Island Newspaper” on the list of NookLink apps, and scroll down to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXKgDK"&gt;Below is an image of what the tracker looks like on my iPhone 12 Mini, taken as I was writing this article. You can see it’s missing the current price and the morning’s price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1KZj34NWVxZcpGP79T02aKExMo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22990021/IMG_1323.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s been a bad week for turnip prices on my island.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s1ezVb"&gt;I had really hoped the Turnip Tracker would let me check my island’s turnip price without having to boot up my Switch, but I guess I’m still going to have to do that for an up-to-the-minute picture of the stalk market. Fortunately, there’s a lot of good reasons to play &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; right now, thanks to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765536/animal-crossing-new-horizons-2-0-update"&gt;jam-packed new update&lt;/a&gt;, so stopping by Nook’s Cranny every once in a while shouldn’t be too much trouble.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes, your Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro can be MagSafe-friendly with this Moment case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhnDp0sypwlk5vjmT5IbaSogRzA=/403x490:5654x3991/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102491/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1126.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment has a whole ecosystem of accessories that will now work with the Pixel 6, thanks to its new M(force) case.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;em&gt;Moment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EJACZV"&gt;Your dangerously slippery Pixel 6 or 6 Pro just arrived, and you’re scrambling to find an available case that will protect your new baby. Whether you are a MagSafe-curious Pixel owner or recently ditched your iPhone for the Pixel but have some MagSafe accessories you don’t want to waste, Moment’s (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro could be the bridge to more platform agnostic mobile accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ei1Rb"&gt;As a mobile accessory maker, Moment embraces the idea that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417836/moment-magsafe-iphone-camera-accessories-review-price-features-specs"&gt;ecosystem of lenses and mounts for content creators&lt;/a&gt; should be compatible with different phone brands and models. After all, each case is compatible with Moment’s catalog of accessories that shares the same mount design — just like the way camera lenses work with various camera bodies. This is not the first time that Moment has made a cross-platform case: earlier this year, the company released some &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fgalaxy-thin-case-m-force%2FS21-ultra-5g-black&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe-compatible cases for the Samsung Galaxy S21s&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZ6dn"&gt;According to Alec Ploof who is in charge of partnerships at Moment, the thought process to make its cases compatible with MagSafe was simple: “We included our proprietary M(Force) magnets into all of the Moment cases we made for iPhone 11, 12, &amp;amp; 13, so we figured to also include them in our new Pixel 6 or Samsung S21 cases to also make these devices compatible with our MagSafe mounting products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vhyFs7Qe1cZa8SVGtGPrPpxDu1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989736/P6_Pro_3_Front.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moment’s case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force has an array of 36 magnets that help MagSafe accessories attach to the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhwhAroeCg3z1lFRPrR2c79fBtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989743/P6_Pro_1_Back.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike Moment’s other cases which feature wood or canvas panels, the (M)Force case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is made of textured polycarbonate and TPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqOnHi"&gt;Unlike Moment’s previous cases that feature wood and canvas panels, there is just one case design for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s case with (M)Force. It’s all black and made of a textured and a “grippy material” called high-strength polycarbonate and TPU. Its three-layer exterior should protect your Pixel 6 from up to six-foot drops and even has a provision for a wrist strap (sold separately). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mB1209"&gt;On the inside is a layer of premium microfiber liner that wraps around your Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, as well as an array of 36 of Moment’s proprietary (M)Force magnets. Those magnets are equivalent to about 15lbs of force, so your MagSafe accessory should be able to attach easily yet securely to your Pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxaowMFWrVtDjSkWqkQHutEX60M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989835/Moment_Pixel6_mforce_magsafe_1134.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moment case for Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro with (M)Force, attached to the Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CeZL9W"&gt;Not only will this Moment case with (M)Force work with its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-pro-tripod-mount-for-magsafe%2Fpro-portrait-landscape&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Tripod Mount with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, it will be able to charge wirelessly with any battery that is Qi- and MagSafe-compatible. This means your Pixel 6 might just be able to make use of other Qi- and MagSafe-friendly accessories out there, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744362/anker-magsafe-maggo-charging-car-home-iphone-mobile"&gt;Anker’s adorable 8-in-1 637 Magnetic Charging Station&lt;/a&gt;. Just don’t expect to get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;15W fast charging from Apple’s official MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj6ZX1"&gt;Both (M)Force cases for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available now on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shopmoment.com%2Fproducts%2Fmoment-case-for-pixel-6%2F6-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22753313%2Fpixel-6-magsafe-pro-moment-mforce-case-mobile-accessories-android" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moment’s website for $50&lt;/a&gt;. While the Pixel 6 case is currently in stock, the Pixel 6 Pro case won’t ship until December 4th due to the global supply shortage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FBI has put out a PSA about an interesting crypto scam</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjtkkdDUc2mgrh586G6FCNjxluA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102182/acastro_170726_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4TU6Z"&gt;The FBI is &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211104"&gt;warning people of a new breed of scam&lt;/a&gt; involving cryptocurrency ATMs. A con artist convinces a person to put cash into a cryptocurrency ATM and send the purchased coins to the scammer using an address stored in a QR code (&lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/05/fbi-warns-of-scams-using-crypto-atms-and-qr-codes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;CoinDesk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While the actual scamming is relatively low-tech, it’s an interesting misuse of technology and shows how criminals are using crypto to “improve” on old methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c55E9J"&gt;As the agency describes it, the scammer will contact their victim and somehow convince them that they need to send money, either with promises of love, further riches, or by impersonating an actual institution like a bank or utility company. After the mark is convinced, the scammer will have them get cash (sometimes out of investment or retirement accounts), and head to an ATM that sells cryptocurrencies and supports reading QR codes. Once the victim’s there, they’ll scan a QR code that the scammer sent them, which will tell the machine to send any crypto purchased to the scammer’s address. Just like that, the victim loses their money, and the scammer has successfully exploited them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vXpwJ9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scammers are using tech to upgrade old tricks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RHqlSR"&gt;If this scam sounds familiar, it may be because it’s basically just a tech twist on &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/before-you-wire-money#why%20scammers%20want%20you%20to%20wire%20money"&gt;wire transfer fraud&lt;/a&gt;. Through whatever means, someone will convince their victim to send them money, and then have them do so using a method that’s difficult to trace, and almost impossible to undo. Like with wire transfers, the system is working as designed — being able to use a QR code instead of having to type in a long wallet address is something that’s handy for legitimate crypto purchases, too. It’s just that instead of going to your wallet, the funds are going to somebody else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1eBPZw"&gt;The “upgrade” (as it were) for scammers with the crypto ATM method is two-fold: it can be less friction than sending a wire transfer, and at the end the scammer has cryptocurrency instead of fiat. With wire transfers, you have to fill out a form, and you may give that form to an actual person (who could potentially vibe check you). Using the ATM method, there’s less time to reflect on the fact that you’re about to send money to a stranger. And, if you’re a criminal trying to get your hands on Bitcoin, you won’t have to teach your targets how to buy coins on the internet and transfer them to another wallet — they probably already know how to use an ATM and scan a QR code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKHDax"&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2021/PSA211104"&gt;FBI&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/before-you-wire-money#why%20scammers%20want%20you%20to%20wire%20money"&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; have some good guidelines on how to avoid getting scammed, but what they really boil down to is this: if someone you don’t know is asking you to send them money, don’t do it using any method, crypto or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google removes its algorithmic ‘Your News Update’ from Assistant</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fuauzd0xNg-u9NJjauplH_BrgEg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70102117/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-8.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dguwI8"&gt;Google has quietly removed its “Your News Update” feature from Assistant, axing the algorithmically personalized audio digest in favor of the company’s existing (and more traditional) news briefings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/05/google-assistant-your-news-update/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgQTbX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20972336/google-assistant-audio-news-feed-algorithm"&gt;Originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Your News Update was an attempt at bringing the same kinds of algorithmic feeds that had been so successful on Facebook or other areas of Google’s products to audio news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeVBm1"&gt;Instead of users picking their three specific new sources (like NPR, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, or CNN), Your News Update would rely on Google’s wealth of personal data to offer far more specific and relevant news updates from a broad range of partners that Google was licensing news from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyibrR"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn pointed out at the time of release, the issue with that kind of system is that it relies on being very, very accurate, especially for audio — where you have to listen through each news story, which is far more time consuming than a text-based version. Plus, as anyone who’s used Google’s algorithmic headline feature in its apps lately knows, Google’s guesses at what you’re interested in can be pretty hit or miss. And of course, there was the same issue with algorithmic feeds here as anywhere else on the internet — that of falling into a self-selected bubble of filtered news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i0LRD"&gt;There’s no official word from Google as to why it’s deprecated the feature, so we may never know for sure the reasoning behind Google abandoning it to its ever-increasing product graveyard. Google Assistant still offers its original news digest option, however, so users won’t be left in the lurch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fixes bug that could cause macOS Monterey to brick Macs with a T2 security chip</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6z6zGs"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744497/macos-12-monterey-apple-mac-download-available-now"&gt;macOS Monterey was released&lt;/a&gt;, there have been several Apple users who said that installing the update bricked their computers. It was unclear what might have caused the issue until today, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1456672355992866816"&gt;Rene Ritchie reports&lt;/a&gt;, he has received this statement from Apple citing an issue with the firmware of its T2 security chip (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/05/apple-rolls-out-fix-for-macos-monterey-bug-that-bricked-some-macs-with-the-t2-chip/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="V2k1Qg"&gt;We have identified and fixed an issue with the firmware on the Apple T2 security chip that prevented a very small number of users from booting up their Mac after updating macOS. The updated firmware is now included with the existing macOS updates. Any users impacted by this issue can contact Apple Support for assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0xVEQS"&gt;There aren’t any specifics on the models affected, possible settings or configurations that are vulnerable, or exactly what a “small number of users” adds up to. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/macos-monterey-bricking-older-macs/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was able to find tweets from at least nine MacBook, MacBook Pro, and iMac owners who said their devices didn’t boot up after the update. It’s good that they can reach out to Apple Support for assistance, but it’s also unclear if those people will be able to retain any data locked in affected devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wanj1N"&gt;The T2 security chip has appeared in a number of Apple computers (&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208862"&gt;you can check the list here&lt;/a&gt;) since it was introduced in 2018. Apple says that updated firmware to eliminate the issue is now included in existing macOS updates (some trackers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iOSReleases/status/1456669546945916935"&gt;noted a refreshed version of the BridgeOS 6.0 software&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the T2 going out today), so it shouldn’t be an issue on any of those machines from now on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is hosting an education-focused event on November 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ujswkIGyhKeJ90ss8VnmfZI-YY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101981/vpavic_210930_4784_0064.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft just launched the affordable Surface Go 3, but maybe it will reveal new hardware at an education-focused event on Tuesday.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ibw7yM"&gt;Microsoft is hosting an event next week focused on education technology. It’s taking place November 9th at 12PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31wHJq"&gt;Details are light, but here’s &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/reimagine-education-2021/"&gt;Microsoft’s description of the event&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AQ32AL"&gt;Join us at 9 a.m. PT on Tuesday, Nov. 9, as we share an inside look at the latest tech solutions while examining gaps in learning left by the pandemic. Hear from Microsoft partners, school leaders and a few special guests, and learn about new and existing technology from Microsoft Education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Slw1HM"&gt;The event arrives just over a month after the company released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708762/microsoft-windows-11-review"&gt;Windows 11, its next major operating system&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the company will detail upcoming education-focused updates on the way for Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLNENe"&gt;Microsoft’s vague hint about “new and existing technology” indicates we could see new hardware revealed at the event as well. The company just revealed a wave of new Surface products at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;an event in September&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe the company isn’t done introducing new hardware in 2021 just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some new BMWs won't have touchscreens thanks to chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EbAFHA5qmrUhp9pp1jzOCf6UFv4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101745/BMW_MY22_3Series_Tech_Carousel_03_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiuAQs"&gt;BMW is dropping touchscreens from many of its new cars due to the chip shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bimmerfest.com/threads/major-option-restriction-announcement.1420312/"&gt;forum post on BimmerFest&lt;/a&gt; and later confirmed by the car company to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Fyour-new-bmw-might-not-have-a-touchscreen.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F5%2F22765709%2Fbmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/05/bmws-losing-touchscreen-functionality/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AutoBlog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While we’ve seen other auto manufactures have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654357/gm-factory-shutdown-chip-shortage-truck-suv"&gt;pause production&lt;/a&gt; or cut other features, this omission is a big deal — nowadays, touchscreens are a fairly standard feature in cars, and not having one will affect how you interact with the car almost every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LA3oqI"&gt;According to the BimmerFest post, some affected vehicles (which include the 3 Series sedans, and X5, X6, and X7 SUVs / crossovers) will also lose access to the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwAWycJA1r4"&gt;backup assistant feature&lt;/a&gt; as well, which automatically backs into spots for you after recording how you drove through them going forward. The post also says that cars shipped without touchscreens will come with a $500 credit and will require both a software update and the customer to sign a form with the dealer to acknowledge that they know about the feature deletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5oocp"&gt;Instead of the touchscreen, users will have to rely on a controller in the center console, which features touchpad-like abilities. It’s a divisive input option between reviewers, but I doubt most people would choose it over the touchscreen under normal circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GfZssJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8oCXwjqQ7P4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tiFbIA"&gt;What’s worse is that, practically speaking, you probably won’t be able to get a touchscreen installed after the fact with the $500 you’re saving from the deletion. At this point, then, it may be best to just try and wait it out — while the chip shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;is expected to last until at least 2023&lt;/a&gt;, cars are often a long-term purchase. Do you really want to be using a touchpad instead of a touchscreen in, say, 2030?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWw8X"&gt;BMW isn’t the only company making cuts to its vehicles to deal with shortages — GM has dropped features as well, from the relatively innocuous like &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/tech/41307/gm-pulls-hd-radio-from-2021-silverado-and-sierra-pickups-over-chip-shortage"&gt;HD radio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575836/gm-wireless-charging-cadillac-chevy-tahoe-chip-shortage"&gt;built-in wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; on some models to serious omissions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;fuel management modules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/41008/gm-drops-auto-stop-start-from-v8-silverados-and-sierras-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;auto stop-start&lt;/a&gt; on some of its V8s and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;much-touted Super Cruise hands-free driving mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has big, new plans to pull CO2 out of the air</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s Largest Carbon-Sucking Plant Starts Making Tiny Dent in Emissions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_5D6pwELgrKzVkXoGmE8VFHLVe4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70101735/1235138673.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Nk9uk"&gt;Despite the efforts of delegates at this month’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/30/22753391/glasgow-climate-change-summit-cop-26-covid-restrictions"&gt;climate summit in Glasgow&lt;/a&gt;, the world is still &lt;a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/"&gt;careening toward&lt;/a&gt; potentially catastrophic levels of global warming. Now, some countries and corporations are turning to new technologies to pull carbon out of the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UynXW"&gt;Today, the US Department of Energy (DOE) announced a bold new &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution"&gt;plan&lt;/a&gt; to make those technologies, called carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, cost-effective and scalable with the launch of a new “Carbon Negative Shot” initiative. Through this initiative, the agency seeks to bring the cost of CDR down dramatically this decade — to less than $100 a ton — so that it can be deployed at a big enough scale to remove “gigatons,” or billions of tons, of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nkLze9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ER2qzI"&gt;That is a hell of a lot of CO2 pollution. Sequestering one gigaton of carbon dioxide would amount to removing the pollution of about 250 million vehicles — the US’s entire light-duty fleet — in one year, according to the DOE. With CDR technologies still in pretty early stages of development, there are significant hurdles to overcome before the DOE can do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4Hoyc"&gt;CDR is a suite of strategies aimed at drawing down CO2 to keep it from trapping heat in the atmosphere. Nature can do some of that for us — trees and plants pull CO2 out of the air. There’s also “direct air capture” technology that mimics that process using carbon-sucking machines, but it has yet to be deployed at a large scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Nub7c"&gt;To draw down enough&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;heat-trapping pollution, the US will likely need large-scale direct air capture plants. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;largest direct air capture plant&lt;/a&gt; came online in Iceland earlier this year, and it’s only able to pull out 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. That’s roughly equivalent to the emissions from 790 passenger vehicles in a year. To date, there are only 19 direct air capture plants around the world, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;International Energy Agency&lt;/a&gt;, and they only have the capacity to capture a tiny fraction of what the DOE’s aims are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDBR69"&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further. Companies like Microsoft pay about $600 for each ton of CO2 the Iceland plant captures. The company pumped out the equivalent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;11,164,000 metric tons&lt;/a&gt; of carbon dioxide in its 2020 fiscal year. At $600 a ton, Microsoft would need to pay almost $6.7 billion to remove just one year of its pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="SgdgXt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cost is one big reason why the tech hasn’t advanced further&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OC97CX"&gt;But cost isn’t the only challenge. Direct air capture plants trap CO2 &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/direct-air-capture"&gt;using filters or chemical solutions&lt;/a&gt;. To release the trapped CO2 so that it can be safely stored, the filter or chemical solution needs to be heated up to very high temperatures — between 100 and 900 degrees Celsius. That takes a lot of energy. In a catch-22, the machines that pull carbon out of the air could wind up using as much as a quarter of the global energy supply by 2100, according to a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/direct-co2-capture-machines-could-use-quarter-global-energy-in-2100"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;. If that energy comes from burning fossil fuels, it could contribute to the problem it’s trying to solve. (And it’s still technically difficult to use purely renewable energy to reach the extremely high temperatures required for the chemical solution method of direct air capture.)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That’s likely why the DOE says in its announcement today that it wants to ensure that “emissions created when running and building the removal technology are accounted for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTwkeY"&gt;Lastly, the DOE is aiming to secure places to store CO2 where it can be monitored for at least 100 years. It ideally needs to stay sequestered for much longer to keep humanity from falling deeper into climate crisis. At the Iceland plant, CO2 is pumped underground, where the companies behind the project say it can be stored in rock formations for thousands of years. Volcanically active Iceland has relatively young and porous basalt rock that’s ideal for this kind of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B7ZnNS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Billions of dollars for new pipelines and carbon storage infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rugyA6"&gt;The US will not only need to find similarly well-suited locations — it’ll need to transport it there via new pipelines. The Biden administration’s infrastructure bill that’s inching closer to a final vote includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;billions of dollars for new pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, and $3.5 billion for four direct air capture “hubs.” That already has some environmental groups concerned about pipeline ruptures, like one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642806/co2-pipeline-explosion-satartia-mississippi-carbon-capture"&gt;sickened residents of a small, majority-Black community&lt;/a&gt; in Mississippi last year. At high concentrations, carbon dioxide is a dangerous asphyxiant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zBBif"&gt;Despite all those challenges, leading climate scientists working with the United Nations have included carbon removal in &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;roadmaps&lt;/a&gt; for limiting the climate crisis to somewhat manageable levels. That’s gotten &lt;a href="https://www.ienearth.org/hands-off-mother-earth/"&gt;criticism from some progressive activists&lt;/a&gt; who see carbon removal as a distraction from transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy. And even experts optimistic about the future of the technology caution that it’s meant to be a side dish and not the main course in any plan to combat climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDpjZW"&gt;“It is at most a supplement that can help us reduce climate change,” David Morrow, director of research at the Institute for Carbon Removal Law and Policy at American University, told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663597/largest-direct-air-capture-plant-c02-climeworks-iceland"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in September&lt;/a&gt; when the Iceland plant came online. “But it can’t take the place of cutting emissions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09oN5G"&gt;The US, the world’s second-biggest CO2 polluter, still needs to focus primarily on finding alternatives to fossil fuels so that it can prevent greenhouse gas emissions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX2inP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 3:50PM ET, November 5th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart’s restock of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles came and went in about 40 minutes, which seems to be par for the course these days. We saw its newer queue system at play, and while the first 20 minutes seemed to count down correctly, we noticed that the queue began to hang and slow down if it did not drop entirely. While many folks have probably seen the “We are having technical issues” message that spells certain doom, hopefully some lucky ones landed their console of choice. We will continue looking out for more console restocks to give you advance notice whenever possible. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lwGDm"&gt;It’s November, and the holiday shopping season is well upon us. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; have already begun, and there’s sure to be a lot more in store for us come actual &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;. But the hottest tickets of the season, just as they were last year, are the still-hard-to-get consoles from Sony and Microsoft. Today, we bring some good news for you. Walmart has just launched its restock of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; consoles, starting at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, Friday, November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxC1Bo"&gt;The consoles are hard enough to come by, but we don’t always get a drop of both Sony and Microsoft consoles at the same time — Walmart has been the only one doing so recently. Today’s restock will include the disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 for $500&lt;/a&gt; and its less-costly sibling, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition for $400&lt;/a&gt;. On the Microsoft front, Walmart’s offerings for today only include the top-tier &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X for $500&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS6qwo"&gt;We strongly advise creating or logging in to your Walmart account in advance of 3PM. Make sure you already have your correct billing and shipping information added to minimize potential risk of delays or issues during the checkout process. If you don’t land the console of your choice right at 3PM, be sure to keep trying as Walmart often releases more stock in 10-minute increments until it’s all cleared out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUv6RI"&gt;Since buying a console is only one part of the equation, we have gone ahead and pulled together some key accessories, game subscriptions, and notable titles you might also consider during your purchase. Many of the options below are on sale or discounted, unlike the consoles, so you can save some money as you step into the latest gaming generation. We’ve even got an exclusive deal for &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers on a 12-month subscription to PlayStation Plus, this weekend only or while supplies last, for just &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeConsoles110521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Furldefense.proofpoint.com%2Fv2%2Furl%3Fu%3Dhttps-3A__www.eneba.com_us_psn-2Dplaystation-2Dnetwork-2Dcard-2Dpsn-2D365-2Ddays-2Dusa-2Dpsn-2Dkey-2Dunited-2Dstates%26d%3DDwMFaQ%26c%3D7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg%26r%3Dxk5KiED8BX7y2-_MCQb470KHOk8NhVXPerTCKuSIIjV9vZUa0o8dpEMoOMF_A_wF%26m%3DnV_0DHdj0FhX_webKkESlfOjCg5lBh3t9p_DUdvg5mhzeaqtP1R_v-b87nWieZeN%26s%3DrupKh2MCtibQPWxgcP1bIsJano46ZNTZUIXKXiEjHlg%26e%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$38 from Eneba&lt;/a&gt; (use code &lt;strong&gt;PLUSYEAR&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout). If picking up any of these accessories or titles at Walmart, add them to your cart ahead of time so you’re ready to go if you manage to nab a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWPq1j"&gt;Good luck, and happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;
