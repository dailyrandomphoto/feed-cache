    <title>WWDC 2021: the latest news from Apple’s annual developer conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpiqaJWWcv1rMhdZW6jMew37egc=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417646/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;What’s new in the Apple ecosystem?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="K28Qfi"&gt;Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference, or WWDC, will run from June 7th through the 11th this year, with the main keynote set for June 7th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. Like last year, &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22085002"&gt;the event will be virtual&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s probably safe to expect another immaculately produced keynote video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFthrB"&gt;Apple is likely to announce updates to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. It’ll be interesting to see what Apple does with the iPad and Mac especially; the iPad Pro is now powered by the same M1 chips as Apple’s best laptops, but its OS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396449/apple-ipad-pro-macbook-air-macos-2021"&gt;arguably holds it back&lt;/a&gt;.  We’re also still waiting on the pro-focused MacBooks and iMacs. While the current versions are fast, they lack the ports and RAM capacity that professionals are looking for, so we’ll be on the lookout for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;rumored MacBook Pro refresh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QO3Ahi"&gt;We’ll be covering everything that happens on the day, and any news that comes out after, which you can catch up on here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Apple’s 2021 WWDC keynote with iOS 15, iPadOS, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWYEH5TwoQiPm42dgvTDMjBrg9Q=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417624/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How many operating systems can Apple update at once?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uhj88V"&gt;Apple’s 2021 Worldwide Developers Conference is upon us again, and we will be tracking all of the new software announcements from the keynote. Apple has a lot of operating system plates spinning and has done a decent job keeping a lot of things under wraps. But there are some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;obvious questions that &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x9yCSd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"},{"title":"Apple isn’t just a walled garden, it’s a carrier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"},{"title":"iOS 15 will reportedly include notifications revamp, new iPad home screen, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NtGyaH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397236/ios-ipados-15-features-rumors-notifications-privacy-home-screen-report"&gt;could be answered&lt;/a&gt; in the online-only event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIWEJL"&gt;Apple’s Arm-based M1 Macs have exceeded most people’s expectations for performance and battery life — but the future of macOS still seems fuzzy with so many different kinds of supported apps. All of that could be forgiven if Apple makes one of its rare WWDC hardware announcements with new MacBook Pro models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osY9BQ"&gt;iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS are all likely to get some attention — and we may even see tvOS get renamed to HomeOS in a nod to the HomePod and Apple’s smart home ambitions. The iPad is expected to get a revamped home screen and maybe another revision to its windowing system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zANOCk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Jpt1c"&gt;All that, some surprises, and what’s sure to be a lot of swooping drone transitions about Apple Park are in store. But the biggest question of all is whether Apple will directly address the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22521476/apple-walled-garden-carrier-app-store-innovation"&gt;growing developer discontent&lt;/a&gt; around its App Store policies. It’s a long shot, but that’s why we live blog: tune in to watch along with us!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Up close with the Ford F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CXMzsHjY29CPgIuWEuhtBp2gUpU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417594/akrales_20210526_4595_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Confirmed: Ford’s first electric truck is a truck&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wGDPXG"&gt;At first glance, the giant pickup truck parked in the middle of the pedestrian path along the Hudson River Greenway was indistinguishable from any other service vehicle. After all, it was just another Ford F-150, the most popular pickup truck and most popular vehicle in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvAjco"&gt;But a closer look would reveal some key differences: the full-width light bar in the front and rear of the vehicle; the giant front truck (or frunk); and the “Lightning” badge on the rear-left corner of the truck. It was less than a week since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;big debut in Dearborn&lt;/a&gt;, and the all-new Ford F-150 Lightning, the automaker’s first electric pickup truck, was making a quick appearance in Manhattan before heading back home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gH0A3Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the first things you notice about the F-150 Lightning is how big it is&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fY4XMi"&gt;One of the first things you notice about the F-150 Lightning is how big it is. It’s not surprising, given how huge trucks in the US have been getting over the last several decades. But while the F-150 Lightning is roughly the same size as its fossil fuel-powered equivalent, it weighs 6,500 pounds — or more than 35 percent more than the gas engine version. That’s in large part thanks to the 1,800-pound battery resting immovably in the floor of the truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNL0rCb8lglKNkuqEEnvQfas4vk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638214/akrales_20210526_4595_0307.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wl1oRRz_DParBeK2_aHyJyG1lLs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638192/akrales_20210526_4595_0029.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wFH3Dc"&gt;Depending on the configuration, that battery will power the F-150 Lightning for 230–300 miles of range on a single charge. It will also help with loads of other truck stuff, like hauling, towing, and off-roading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3t0jA3"&gt;The electric version of the F-150 does not lack in truckiness. It has lots of quirks and features that will help it find fans among the millions of current F-150 owners, such as the extra step that extends out the back of the tailgate to help when climbing into the bed, or the ridiculous number of power outlets — both 120- and 240-volt — that can be found all over this truck. The bed also serves as a scale that can help factor in the weight of whatever cargo is being carried to see how it will adversely impact the truck’s overall range.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3bZjBO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The electric version of the F-150 does not lack in truckiness&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XnyMwS"&gt;Inside, the F-150 Lightning is reminiscent of the Mustang Mach-E, its immediate predecessor in Ford’s new lineup of long-range EVs. The 15.5-inch portrait touchscreen, which is basically the same as in the Mustang, will be available in the more expensive trims. The software felt fluid and responsive, despite lacking in some of the key details, like battery capacity, that will be available in the production version of the truck. (The truck we saw was a pre-production unit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luRFId"&gt;Unlike the Mach-E, though, the F-150 Lightning had a non-zero amount of physical buttons, such as a towing button to the left of the screen that helps when hitching up gear to your truck. That’s probably because Ford assumes that truck owners, especially those using it for work, would prefer a more balanced mix between analog and digital controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtLWKE1TmJDZbuQcdxykuATnZM0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638200/akrales_20210526_4595_0085.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqvtJv"&gt;One interesting quirk is the collapsing gear shifter in the center console. When you want to fold out the full workstation, there’s a button that will cause the shifter to fold down from its vertical position to a horizontal one, allowing you a lot more space for a laptop. This isn’t unique to the F-150 Lightning — Ford offers this feature in its gas trucks, too — but it’s nice to see it carry over to the electric version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5LF7M"&gt;The frunk — sorry, “Mega Power Frunk” — is really as big as advertised, if not more so. The frunk was able to fit three &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;employees sitting side by side, which really says it all. There’s also a button on the inside that automatically raises the lid, in case a child (or small adult) gets trapped inside. It’s comforting to know that Ford is taking into consideration these scary scenarios. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1S_LbYOEmYq7s8IJpnQ2dCDNi04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638197/akrales_20210526_4595_0061.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KKB0VVB-e-Mq4BPYQ3n-SN63gSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638210/akrales_20210526_4595_0257.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YnYc2Z"&gt;One of the F-150 Lightning’s biggest selling points is its bidirectional power capabilities. Ford claims that the truck’s 2.4kW–9.6kW output (depending on the trim level) can be enough to power an entire house for several days. While we didn’t get to test out any of these more interesting features, it certainly speaks to Ford’s desire to make mobile power generation a hallmark of the entire F-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJoLY2"&gt;While, unfortunately, we didn’t get a chance to drive it, we can certainly confirm that the F-150 Lightning is very much a truck. Whether truck owners will agree... well, we’ll have to wait until next year when the Lightning goes into production to say for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8TrJ4S"&gt;Less than two hours before Apple’s big Worldwide Developers Conference, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113127348899371"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced&lt;/a&gt; that the company would be launching a new interface for creators that shows how different fees affect their earnings on the platform. The announcement comes as Apple is under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/6/22520378/apple-wwdc-2021-developer-insult-macbook-pro"&gt;intense scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; for its App Store fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkmQHK"&gt;Here’s a preview of what the new interface will look like. This example breaks down exactly how taxes and fees are taken away from a creator’s event revenue:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LKSVIfomLh6e1WwRxBANbZUK9cQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642780/Future___FB_payout_interface___paid_online_events.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of Facebook’s new payout interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wnbS5C"&gt;Zuckerberg wasn’t clear as to when the new interface would be launching beyond saying that there’d be “more to come soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gu8q75"&gt;Zuckerberg also says the company will keep paid online events, fan subscriptions, badges, and “our upcoming independent news products” free for creators until 2023. This is an extension of a policy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369169/facebook-paid-live-events-ios-android-apple-app-store-fees-fortnite-epic"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. When Facebook introduced the events feature last year, it had promised that it wouldn’t collect fees until “at least” 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdclxm"&gt;The company eventually plans to introduce a revenue share, Zuckerberg says — but when it does, it will be “less than the 30% that Apple and others take.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIWPEv"&gt;Facebook and Apple are also embroiled in a public spat over Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;introduced with iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook has come out strongly against the change, taking out full-page &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;newspaper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;ads&lt;/a&gt; criticizing the changes ahead of their eventual release, and more recently, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;asked users for permission to track them&lt;/a&gt; to help keep Facebook and Instagram “free of charge.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple paid millions after iPhone repair techs posted a customer’s nude photos to Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone games" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5e5X5UfufPK53rTPoY3FzzJDIM=/0x0:3840x2560/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417568/iphone-games-001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gLtyDh"&gt;Apple paid an unknown multimillion-dollar sum to a woman after iPhone repair technicians uploaded nude photos from her phone to Facebook. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2021%2F06%2F06%2Fapple-pays-millions-woman-explicit-photos-posted-online%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F7%2F22522560%2Fapple-repair-multimillion-iphone-nude-photos-privacy-settlement-pegatron" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reported the 2016 payment&lt;/a&gt; based on court documents recently tied to Apple’s name, and Apple confirmed the incident in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBphzs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340837/gov.uscourts.cand.340837.141.2.pdf"&gt;The case involves&lt;/a&gt; an unnamed Oregon college student known as Jane Doe, who sent her iPhone to a major Apple repair contractor called Pegatron Technology Service. While the phone was being repaired at Pegatron’s California facility, two technicians uploaded sexually explicit photos and a video from her phone to her Facebook account. Court documents say the files were uploaded in a way that suggested Doe had posted them herself, and her attorney asked Apple for $5 million in compensation for the resulting emotional distress. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; says the exact amount of a subsequent agreement wasn’t revealed, but it amounted to a “multimillion-dollar” deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtZxWS"&gt;Documents say Apple performed an “exhaustive investigation” of the facility, and the two employees responsible for the incident were fired. “We take the privacy and security of our customers’ data extremely seriously and have a number of protocols in place to ensure data is protected throughout the repair process,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “When we learned of this egregious violation of our policies at one of our vendors in 2016, we took immediate action and have since continued to strengthen our vendor protocols.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h6ljOF"&gt;The incident became public because Pegatron reimbursed Apple for the settlement, then &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/6817054/pegatron-technology-service-inc-v-zurich-american-ins-co/"&gt;sued its own insurance provider&lt;/a&gt; for refusing to cover the payment. Apple pushed successfully for its name to be removed from the filings, and it’s referred to only as a “customer” in the complaint. But its identity was revealed in a &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.340837/gov.uscourts.cand.340837.141.0.pdf"&gt;newer, unrelated case&lt;/a&gt; involving Apple and Pegatron, where attorneys stated that the customer was “clearly Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inOaBs"&gt;Other companies have faced lawsuits after repair technicians invaded customers’ privacy — in 2015, for instance, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/DA/20150702/News/605153539/TL"&gt;settled a suit&lt;/a&gt; claiming Geek Squad members copied a woman’s nude photos from her computer and posted them online. But as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; notes, Apple has made privacy and security a selling point for the iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/Apple-iPhone-Right-to-Repair-program_id120557"&gt;arguing against&lt;/a&gt; consumer “right to repair” laws that it says would compromise the safety of its authorized repair program.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is coming to Chromecast with Google TV and Android TV on June 23rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVgyyKncjAT46f5_La_-DEeqgfI=/0x0:1566x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417419/googlestadiaandroidtv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cDR4YI"&gt;Google is expanding the availability of its Stadia game streaming service to more TVs and streaming devices later this month. The first version of Stadia on Chromecast with Google TV is launching on June 23rd, more than eight months after the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492682/new-chromecast-google-tv-stadia-support-launch"&gt;launched without official Stadia support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JNr9K"&gt;Alongside Chromecast with Google TV support, Stadia will also be available on a number of Android TV devices on June 23rd. Not every Android TV device is supported, but Nvidia’s Shield TV devices have made the list. Here’s the official support list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TPB2YL"&gt;Chromecast with Google TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2VCL9V"&gt;Hisense Android Smart TVs (U7G, U8G, U9G)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQZsNr"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lQYjKk"&gt;Nvidia Shield TV Pro&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PRwv4B"&gt;Onn FHD Streaming Stick and UHD Streaming Device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TL9o2p"&gt;Philips 8215, 8505, and OLED 935 / 805 Series Android TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X3oxRN"&gt;Xiaomi MIBOX3 and MIBOX4 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="bxwl0O"&gt;If you don’t see your Android TV device listed, you may still be able to get Stadia running. You can opt into experimental support to play Stadia, just by installing the Stadia app from the Play Store and hitting continue on the opt-in screen. Android TV devices will need a compatible Bluetooth controller or Google’s own Stadia Controller to play Stadia. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki is a chance for Disney Plus to escape the shadow of Marvel blockbusters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xa9Ftc2ZBPCWuiaLtSz3HU-r4g0=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69417057/TRA8660_105_TRL_comp_v004.1092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sqx9XH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, the one-time Marvel villain played for over a decade now by Tom Hiddleston, is on the verge of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;starring in his own series&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of playing the scene-stealing antagonist — or, later, grudging sidekick — to Chris Hemsworth’s square-jawed Thor, the God of Mischief is finally going to get to be fully in the spotlight. It’s something that fans have been asking for since the character first made his scenery-chewing debut in 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; — but the new show looks far more detached from the MCU than any of his previous adventures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="962b7H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is a new kind of series for Disney Plus. It’s the first that intentionally feels like a capital-S Spinoff. The first two Marvel shows, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, occupied very different roles in the overarching storyline that Kevin Feige has been overseeing for the last 23 odd films. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZXArg"&gt;Those two shows are arguably continuations of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;providing more breathing space and room for exploration of events that might have, in an earlier phase of the Marvel experiment, been obliquely referenced in between movies. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, at the end of the day, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"&gt;a prelude to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a setup for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400190/captain-america-4-falcon-winter-solider-creator-malcolm-spellman-report"&gt;upcoming fourth Captain America film&lt;/a&gt; rumored to star Anthony Mackie as the star-spangled Avenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ta8IFP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WandaVision finale: where do we go from here?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315094/wandavision-finale-marvel-mcu-scarlet-witch-doctor-strange-captain"},{"title":"The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399269/falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-marvel-captain-america-future"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JKjJXX"&gt;If one were feeling particularly cynical, you could view &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;as being less tied to a grand storyline and more to Disney and Marvel just giving the people what they want. Hiddleston’s depiction of the character has long been a fan-favorite. His repeatedly faked-out deaths and journey from murderous villain to an almost-hero speak to Marvel’s hard work to keep the character in play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bfq5gX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3R9g_VABesA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIOGOc"&gt;It’s easy to look at &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; in a similar vein: the latest attempt by Disney to cash in on the popularity by resurrecting Loki one last time for an adventure that will get fans who might not have cared about Wanda’s grief, Vision’s existential crisis, or Falcon’s internal struggle with race and power in America to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision#:~:text=The%20company%20has%20blown%20past,Plus%2C%20HotStar)%20by%202024."&gt;pony up for a Disney Plus subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HDtCb9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Loki’ is both natural story thread and shoehorned backdoor pilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4pT8y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is a natural story thread as much as a shoehorned backdoor pilot stuck into &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;’s time heist. It’s not the bridge between blockbuster movies. It’s a show that’s attempting to strike out on its own, starting a new story for the trickster god that’s — at least in theory — less tethered to future films. But in the same approach, its relatively disconnected status means that (in addition to pandering) there’s the opportunity for Marvel to actually make a more standalone series that can actually be a good TV show, instead of just serving as blockbuster-lite fare stretched across too many episodes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8sRfX"&gt;It’s a dichotomy that the original modern Marvel TV series — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/13/4326092/marvel-agents-of-shield-first-teaser-trailer-abc-coulson"&gt;ABC’s &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — struggled with over its run. The earlier seasons still attempted to stuff themselves into a box constrained by the films, with major plot points and character cameos dictated by the blockbuster release schedule, much to the detriment of the show. But once &lt;em&gt;S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt; started to ignore the movies and strike out on its own (helped in part by the fraying relationships between Marvel Studios and the separate, and now shuttered, Marvel Television division) it became a far better series. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioPdzzQn0PMfVRfKBXtcut3ixYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553154/ARC_101_09922.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Chuck Zlotnick&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ChA3Gl"&gt;By ignoring the larger MCU films, &lt;em&gt;S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt; was able to branch out with storylines like its Ghost Rider and Framework arcs instead of trying to hide in the cracks between movies. And the show’s final seasons — a time-travel-infused adventure — completely jettison the “everything is connected” mantra that dominated the first two seasons to become an almost completely standalone series that wasn’t weighed down by awkward continuity issues or shoehorned cameos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QeWYv"&gt;Loki, as a character, has been best in small doses so far: a villainous turn here, a monologuing speech there, a few back stabbings on his way toward redemption. It’s possible that a full series for the character will be too much of a good thing — that Loki, absent the foil of his brother or the Avengers, just isn’t too compelling on his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZKtxB"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; could help elevate Disney Plus’ series into more standalone stories that don’t just serve as way stations toward films (or as standalone as a Marvel related story can be, at any rate). It’s a lesson that the comics that all these movies and shows are based on have taught long ago: sometimes the best stories are the standalone one-shot spinoffs, not the 1,000-issue epics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9YlQjO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Disney Plus ","description":"Loki Premiers on June 9th ","label":"Subscribe Now","url":"https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1084177/9358?subId1=VergeLoki&amp;amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi routers are cheaper than ever for Prime members</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eero 6" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6_CdYIIrgnp_5C1t92ni4TFnp7I=/0x0:1162x775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69416855/eero6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FkUesJ"&gt;Amazon is gearing up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; — which is happening on Monday, June 21st, and Tuesday, June 22nd — by releasing some teaser deals for Prime members. Today’s big deal is on the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi 6 router. It’s normally $129, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VM9ZDD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get one for $83&lt;/a&gt;. This is a good starting point if you have plans to build a multiroom mesh Wi-Fi system to blanket every corner of your home in reliable internet access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29NZbL"&gt;This router has two ethernet ports, one for a modem and another for any other device you’d prefer to have wired for the fastest speeds. The Eero 6 claims to cover 1,500 square feet with Wi-Fi signal, and you can easily add another one to your network to expand coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RseppW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9538454" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D32U82"&gt;If you want to dive into the Eero ecosystem more fully, Prime members can also grab a three-pack of Eero’s latest networking gear for the best-ever price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-eero-6-3-pack/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Get a router plus two extenders for $181&lt;/a&gt; (originally $279). Note that the extenders (usually $89 each) lack ethernet ports, but it’s still a good deal if you want Wi-Fi all over your home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rBZUdr"&gt;Facebook’s latest Portal smart display is $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Facebook-Portal-Calling-Screen-Display/dp/B07XPDYRRJ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742758071059731830#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, dropping well below its original $179 price. Previously, the best-ever price was $130. We’ve recommended displays like these several times during the pandemic, but they’re useful to have for more normal times, too. With this model, you can jump into video chats with friends and family on Facebook or WhatsApp or with work or fun meetups over Zoom. This model can find you in the frame by panning and zooming automatically as you walk around the room. It also features Alexa integration for smart home control or just to ask Alexa a question. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dXr1aq"&gt;Logitech’s Folio Touch keyboard case for the 11-inch iPad Pro is back down to $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Keyboard-Trackpad-Connector-11-inch/dp/B08HRQV5V8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740253167256169203#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If the idea of spending $299 on Apple’s Magic Keyboard doesn’t sit well with you, this is a good alternative. It features backlit keys and a trackpad, and when you aren’t typing, it can be folded into modes that are ideal for sketching or watching movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qwopsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10493403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wMqlKy"&gt;This 750W modular power supply from EVGA that’s 80 Plus Gold rated for energy efficiency &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EVGA-Supernova-Modular-Warranty-220-GA-0750-X1/dp/B07WW1XF51?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $80 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Its price usually hovers between $100 and $140, so it’s a good time to buy if you’re in the market for an upgrade. This wattage will deliver the necessary amount of power for the most demanding graphics cards on the market, like the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. It’s fully modular, too, so you can remove some of the cables that might not be necessary for you, like SATA if you’re opting for M.2 drives instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung shows off stretchable OLED screen in prototype heart rate monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQBOk0fK5CS767MqVaDy8VN1ORg=/6x0:869x575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69416813/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.45.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s prototype heart rate monitor with stretchable OLED display. &lt;/em&gt; | Image &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung / SAIT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z2rYMu"&gt;We’ve had curved displays for a while now, but what about stretchy ones? Samsung says it’s &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;making progress&lt;/a&gt; building screens “that can be stretched in all directions like rubber bands,”  and that the first applications for this material could be in building flexible health tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2idnEW"&gt;The company’s researchers recently created an OLED display that can be stretched by up to 30 percent while operating as normal. As a proof of concept, engineers integrated this display into a stretchable heart rate monitor that can be stuck onto the skin like a Band-Aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHkTWZ"&gt;“The strength of this technology is that it allows you to measure your biometric data for a longer period without having to remove the solution when you sleep or exercise, since the patch feels like part of your skin,” Samsung’s Youngjun Yun said of the prototype technology in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-researchers-prove-the-viability-of-commercialized-stretchable-devices?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “You can also check your biometric data right away on the screen without having to transfer it to an external device.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display is basic, with obvious pixels, but can be stretched by up to 30 percent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RRkuPZ"&gt;The display is rudimentary, but it worked as normal after being stretched 1,000 times, say Samsung’s engineers. The design of the heart rate monitor, sitting flush to the patient’s skin, allowed it to pick up a signal 2.4 times stronger than an ordinary sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxxXRE"&gt;Although the technology is only in the early stages of development, Samsung suggests it could be used to support an array of health-monitoring systems in the future. “The technology can also be expanded to use in wearable healthcare products for adults, children and infants, as well as patients with certain diseases,” says Yun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZJ0M5"&gt;Details of the research have been &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/23/eabg9180"&gt;published in the journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Science Advances&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/89-E00tdamOdyXwmfZKV4Jqpd8E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642437/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_2.47.50_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display works because of a grid-like “island” structure with stiff islands and more flexible channels. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k5k4OZ"&gt;The display can be stretched because it’s built from a specially designed flexible material known as elastomer. This elastomer has been treated to resist the heat of the integrated electronics by Samsung’s engineers and has a particular grid-like “island” structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdkwo2"&gt;The islands of elastomer are implanted with individual OLED pixels and are stiffer than the surrounding channels, while flexible electrodes are used to conduct the electricity. This bipartite structure allows “the spaces and wiring electrodes between the pixels to stretch and shrink without the OLED pixels themselves becoming deformed,” says Yun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chrFWQ"&gt;Don’t expect to see a new Stretchable Samsung Galaxy anytime soon (though the concept would fit nicely with theories of an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_of_the_universe"&gt;expanding universe&lt;/a&gt;), as the screens built from this technology are too basic to be used for anything other than simple monitors. But in the future, tech like this could create wearable gadgets that are less rigid and more comfortable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj5MfC"&gt;If you’re interested in reading up on more of the science behind stretchable screens, &lt;em&gt;IEEE Spectrum &lt;/em&gt;has a &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/portable-devices/from-foldable-phones-to-stretchy-screens"&gt;nice report on the topic&lt;/a&gt; from last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Realme’s Snapdragon 888 flagship is coming to Europe for €549</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYh1l3fzhy2yIG2J3EXm4y37NM4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415712/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_21.24.24.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XG4nos"&gt;The Realme GT, Realme’s Snapdragon 888-equipped flagship phone, is coming to Europe and will sell for €549 (about $670) for a model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, according to the company’s website. The price makes it among the cheapest Snapdragon 888 devices available to date, if not the cheapest. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s excellent-value Mi 11&lt;/a&gt; started at €749 (~$910) for an 8GB / 128GB model, for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpCLLp"&gt;Realme says the GT will ship to Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Portugal, though the device isn’t currently available to actually order. It’s not clear which other European markets it’ll be available in when it does launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFcnwT"&gt;Realme &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the Chinese version of the GT in March. It started at 2,799 yuan there for the 8GB / 128GB model, or about $440 at current exchange rates. Madhav Sheth, CEO of Realme’s Indian and European business, confirmed last week that the GT would get a global launch — a performance-focused flagship model in June and a camera-focused flagship model in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qrS15Z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The GT series will be a part of realme’s new flagship focusing on high-performance and image, respectively. This will not only allow us to achieve technological breakthroughs but will also keep us ahead of the market.&lt;/p&gt;— Madhav Max 5G (@MadhavSheth1) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MadhavSheth1/status/1400384292191019015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afs0gL"&gt;It’s not quite clear yet how those models will differ in Europe spec-wise, but the Chinese version of the GT had a 64-megapixel primary camera with an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro sensor, so there’s certainly room for improvement on the camera flagship. Elsewhere, the GT has a 6.43-inch 120Hz OLED display, up to 12GB of RAM, and a 4,500mAh battery with 65W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUU1IZ"&gt;Realme started out as a sub-brand of Oppo focused on the Indian market but quickly turned into a major force in its own right and is now focusing on capturing Europe with more premium devices. The launch of the GT follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270219/realme-x3-superzoom-uk-spain-launch-price-specs"&gt;last year’s €499 X3 Superzoom&lt;/a&gt;, which had a Snapdragon 855+ and a periscope telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;
