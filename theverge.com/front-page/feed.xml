    <title>DirecTV Stream and satellite TV are raising their prices next month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DirecTV Tops Profit Estimates as More Customers Sign Up" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JMLTqXXmmlX2-iHAHRnlnWXeRxs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279286/488453459.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q67Ya2"&gt;DirecTV’s satellite and Stream services are getting price increases in January — hikes that the company attributed to rising programming costs as well as “higher-than-normal inflation across our suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQXGWq"&gt;Beginning January 23rd of next year, customers of both groups are likely to see their bills increase — though specifically by how much will depend on the service. Most of DirecTV’s satellite customers will see their monthly costs increase anywhere between $1 and 10, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.directv.com/support/satellite/article/KM1442186/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;depending on which package&lt;/a&gt; they pay for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BxOHa"&gt;Additionally, regional sports network costs will be determined by ZIP code. While this means some customers could see a monthly increase of $2 more per month, others will see a decrease, and some customers will see no change at all when the new pricing goes into effect. (Customers can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.directv.com/DTVAPP/content/rsn_fee" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check their ZIP&lt;/a&gt; on the DirecTV site to see their monthly RSN fee.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CpIP70"&gt;Stream customers, meanwhile, will also see a price hike on many for the majority of Stream packages. Price increases per month will vary from &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.directv.com/support/stream/article/KM1466120/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$4 more to $10 more&lt;/a&gt;, depending on the plan. The changes will affect many DirecTV Stream users even if they were grandfathered into their plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sq2g5w"&gt;In notices to its DirecTV and Stream customers obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company said the decision to hike prices would occur “despite our efforts to absorb some of these costs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6pYZZ"&gt;“While competitors continue to shrink their offerings, your DirecTV team maintains a steadfast commitment to carrying the most robust channel line-up in the industry and unrivalled [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;] leadership in premium sports and news content,” the company wrote. “In addition, we continue to invest in providing better customer service, releasing new technology upgrades that will enhance our signal reliability, and launching improved features. We are also delivering greater flexibility to watch what you want, when you want it, from virtually anywhere in the U.S.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdnOkz"&gt;Anyone on promotional discounts will continue to be billed at their current rate until the promotional period ends, at which time the new price will be reflected on their bill. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zThM19eW8UeFtTLtf7bAahfqzDM=/0x2:2048x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70116332/Budget_50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Richard Parry&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gifts don’t always require you to splurge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="grzXMI"&gt;Even though many of us are better off in some ways than we were in 2020, we’re still in the midst of a pandemic. And for a good number of people, that means this holiday season will, like last year, be about celebrating on a budget. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Xuioi"&gt;Luckily, there are still plenty of great gifts you can pick up before the holidays are over if you have a little spending cash in your wallet. Our budget-conscious gift guide features a variety of ideas that cost under $50, all of which are either thoughtful, entertaining, or incredibly useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPq2aB"&gt;Below, you’ll find personalized art prints illustrating what the Solar System looked like the day your loved one was born — or the minute you met your partner. Other suggestions, like Rocketbook’s reusable smart notebook, can help a friend or family member declutter their life and remain environmentally conscious while doing so. We even have a few literary staples on the list, as well as a smart garage door opener and a Bluetooth tracker that allows Apple users to keep better tabs on their belongings while on the move. Holiday travel is still a thing, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We didn’t need an AR version of Snake, but AT&amp;T just gave us one anyway</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyvzLeI-kJr3MWN6golqBER8L38=/0x50:2100x1450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279143/5g_snake_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warp Speed Worm is an AR filter for Instagram and Messenger and has tenuous connections to 5G at best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VBq5av"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T has re-imagined the classic Snake game in a new, interactive, and wholly unnecessary way in an effort to promote the capabilities of its 5G network. Called &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/facebook-warp-speed-worm.html"&gt;Warp Speed Worm&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an AR effect that can be used on Instagram and Facebook Messenger video calls.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd5HQ"&gt;Snake was, of course, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/27/14749896/nokia-3310-snake-gameplay-preview-mwc-2017"&gt;game of choice&lt;/a&gt; on your early Nokia phone. Or, depending on your age and general level of apathy toward high school mathematics, you may recognize it as the game you played on your TI-83 graphing calculator while you were supposed to be learning about coefficients. Not that I know anyone who would do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuUZ0r"&gt;In any case, this newest contribution to the great Snake game &lt;em&gt;genre&lt;/em&gt; is an AR filter in which the titular worm is controlled by your head movements. You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network, or you can be a total doofus and play on your own using the camera in the Instagram app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upPDP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can play with friends, which AT&amp;amp;T would like you to do on their 5G network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmjSwD"&gt;It’s sort of cute — you tilt your head left or right to direct the worm to pick up little game controller icons. As you’ll recall from AP Calculus, the more the worm eats, the longer it gets. When the worm inevitably eats itself, the game is over, and a sad little dead worm crown appears on your head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n6WIF"&gt;I gave the game a try by myself after struggling to understand how to save and use an AR group effect on an Instagram video call. I’ll admit that I missed the physical controls of my calculator and that my neck creaks alarmingly loud when I tilt it repeatedly. I also can’t comment on how AT&amp;amp;T 5G would have enhanced the experience — it worked just fine on my home Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso gets a cute claymation holiday short</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeiJTVfbFLjvpnIAieWa-E0lRk0=/76x0:904x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279055/121521_Ted_Lasso_Animated_Holiday_Short_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOMZTH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22590155/ted-lasso-apple-tv-plus-season-2-review"&gt;Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ended on something of a dark note, but everything is all nice and friendly again in a new holiday short. It’s called “The Missing Christmas Mustache,” and, like many classic holiday specials, it’s rendered in cute and charming claymation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgBvsf"&gt;It features voices of the main cast — including Jason Sudeikis, Hannah Waddingham, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/9/1/22652236/ted-lasso-roy-kent-cgi-conspiracy-theory"&gt;definitely-not-CGI Brett Goldstein&lt;/a&gt; — as they search for a missing mustache. It’s only four minutes long, so I won’t spoil too much, only to say you should at least watch to learn a little more about Roy Kent’s eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myJnzA"&gt;If nothing else, it makes up for the poorly-timed Christmas episode of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; that aired in August — and threw my sense of time and date even further out of whack. And it’s a nice little taste of the show’s wholesomeness while we all wait for season 3 to come to Apple TV Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter’s plan to save the smart home </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH3xc4NgYaMz_QI9ezoQSF9g1nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70268903/acastro_211117_4887_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Matter is a new standard that promises to fix smart home interoperability — but can it deliver?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t5qLmO"&gt;The smart home should be a natural evolution of our homes, bringing better appliances, better systems, better experiences. But to date, it’s been complicated, confusing, and expensive. Walled gardens have stifled innovation as developers focus on getting their devices to work with three or four or more different platforms rather than spending their time creating better products and new features. Consumers spend too much energy figuring out which product works with which and then troubleshooting those connections, before often giving up on the whole thing. This has led to a slower smart home adoption than many expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCtd7u"&gt;What the smart home needs, and has needed for a long time, is a universal connectivity standard — a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21028256/smart-home-standard-google-apple-amazon-alexa-siri-zigbee-choip"&gt;basic level of common plumbing in our homes&lt;/a&gt; for everything to flow through. Just as we chose VHS over Betamax in the ’80s (and Blu-ray over HD-DVD in the early 2000s) for a better home theater experience,  so we need to choose a smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wyEbHC"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4578799766&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EsEraa"&gt;The problem is there aren’t two or three standards to choose from. There are many, and none of them work very well on their own. Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth have all tried and failed to become the primary radio protocol of the smart home. But none have gained enough traction or offered enough flexibility to fit into all corners of the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn2P9z"&gt;That’s where Matter comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M-Z-nOK7Q7nT95Yzp7aVixVZfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079856/acastro_4887_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vtaYcE"&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home. Set up that new device with your favorite smart home app, and control it with your voice assistant of choice, no matter who made it. This may sound like some distant smart home nirvana, but this is the promise of Matter. The simple smart home could be just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ow3RE"&gt;An open-sourced connectivity standard created by over 200 companies, Matter is a communication protocol that leverages existing technologies — Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and ethernet — to allow all of your devices to communicate with each other locally, without the need for a cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M2Fle3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buy a gadget, plug it in, and it will work with the rest of your smart home&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qUilte"&gt;What makes Matter more than just another smart home standard is momentum; most of the industry is on board. Organized by the Connectivity Standards Alliance (or CSA, formerly the Zigbee Alliance), Matter is being developed by Amazon, Apple, Google / Nest, and Samsung, alongside many other smart home and smart home-adjacent companies, including Wyze, iRobot, Signify (Philips Hue), Ecobee, &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;and more&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVbU8O"&gt;Driven by a shared need to fix the problems of the smart home, these companies are working together to figure out how to make this standard be the one that sticks. Can Matter finally bring an end to the confusion perfectly encapsulated by Randall Munroe’s classic xkcd “&lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/927/"&gt;Standards&lt;/a&gt;” comic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeplUXpmj1adDXyyVOg8H8OzwcQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084306/standards.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Comic by xkcd&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNB9Yx"&gt;“This is a Renaissance [for the smart home]” says Tobin Richardson, president and CEO of the CSA. “Most of the industry, if not all the industry have agreed that [Matter] is going to be the way this will happen.” They are seemingly all on board with the fact that Matter is the solution to the smart home’s biggest problems — simplicity, interoperability, reliability, and security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhf5Ct"&gt;The final Matter specification, SDK, and certification program should be ready by mid-2022, and the goal is to have the first Matter-certified devices available by the end of 2022, says Richardson. That’s over a year later than promised when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Matter first launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but better late than never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="L8H9co"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Amazon, Google, Apple, and Samsung will work with Matter, and which products you should buy.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETdn7w"&gt;If you have already boned up on what Matter is and why it… matters, and you just want to know what devices you can buy and when, head over to our explainer piece “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22596168"&gt;What matters about Matter&lt;/a&gt;” article, where we look at what the different smart home platforms have committed to supporting around Matter and which devices are Matter-ready (a number of smart home makers have announced plans to update existing products as soon as Matter arrives). Otherwise, read on to learn about how Matter is going to fix the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="up26W0"&gt;What is Matter, and why is it different?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="zL4HCM"&gt;Matter is a unified connectivity technology for the smart home. It is not a smart home platform like Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon’s Alexa. Matter doesn’t automate or control your home; it simply provides the pipes and language for devices to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ow3IDq"&gt;Its unique feature is it’s an IP-based technology, meaning it uses the same mechanisms to communicate as the internet. So, there is no dependency on bridges or hubs, and yes, you will (eventually) be able to get rid of all those white boxes hooked up to your modem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGjgMI"&gt;To simplify adoption, Matter will start as an application layer on top of existing IP technologies, including ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, and Bluetooth (for device provisioning). This means Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sr_XaQQMw4yPG4CCnnPWSA7QnDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084404/start_developing_with_matter_graphic.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Z-Wave Alliance&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Matter network map shows how devices will connect to each other, to the internet, and to other protocols using Wi-Fi, Thread, and Matter controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x5QDBu"&gt;Once in your home, Matter devices can operate entirely locally, talking to each other over Thread and Wi-Fi and not going through the cloud. That means if your internet goes down, your smart home will still work. Devices will still need to communicate with the internet for out-of-home control and firmware and security upgrades, which will happen directly or through a Matter controller device (i.e., a smart speaker, smartphone, or bridge). Local control is a significant step in maintaining privacy in the smart home, a big concern for people when considering installing smart home devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wACI89"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Smart home company Eve plans to use Matter to move beyond Apple’s HomeKit ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"},{"title":"Google commits to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738584/google-smart-home-developer-summit-2021-matter-thread"},{"title":"Samsung promises Matter support for SmartThings hubs, Galaxy devices, TVs, and fridges ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22745664/samsung-smartthings-matter-support-products-galaxy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eQBxti"&gt;Smart home company Eve built its entire business model on local control. “Our privacy platform is ‘what’s at home stays at home,’” Jerome Gackel, Eve Systems CEO, tells me. “With Matter, you do not need a cloud — you can have one, but it’s not a requirement.” Its commitment to avoiding cloud control is why Eve devices have been iPhone- and HomeKit-only thus far. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;But with Matter, Eve can move to the other platforms while remaining entirely local&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Z8145w"&gt;What is Thread, and why is it better?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xzuPtx"&gt;Thread is one of the key technologies of Matter. It promises to make the smart home more robust. Like Z-Wave and Zigbee, Thread is a low-power mesh networking protocol. “Networking is one of the biggest problems of the smart home; sensors and devices dropping offline,” says Tony Fadell, founder of Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RYWAK"&gt;Thread and the precursor to Matter, Weave, was first developed in 2014 by Nest and six other companies, including Silicon Labs, ARM, Samsung Electronics, and Yale Security. Thread’s big selling points are speed and reliability. A motion sensor will turn your lights on in a millisecond compared to a second, and your network won’t go down because you accidentally unplugged the hub, as — with enough devices deployed — a Thread network can self-heal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DXX7rddXUr9CI8ZEM-AOaIqdQc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079855/acastro_4887_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidoTm"&gt;Unlike Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, Thread was specifically developed as a smart home protocol. Other protocols used in the smart home to date have been co-opted into that role, meaning they have practical and usability issues. Wi-Fi is too power-hungry for battery-powered devices. Bluetooth has range limitations. Zigbee and Z-Wave require dedicated hubs, which are cumbersome to set up and maintain and can be a single point of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="rgpygN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter is not reinventing the wheel; it’s adding better technology to the highways our smart homes are driving on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xOt5EO"&gt;Thread began in Nest’s earliest days. “Every single Nest thermostat since the beginning has shipped with a Zigbee radio inside, a connection for a long-distance, low-power protocol,” says Fadell. The idea was to future-proof a device likely to stay in the home for 10 to 20 years. “We wanted it to be able to talk to the future smart home,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="5W7LAL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10917556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGPb0G"&gt;But Zigbee wasn’t progressing fast enough for the Nest team, so they worked with Silicon Labs and others to develop Thread, which, in technical terms, is a Zigbee hardware stack with a software layer on top. “We knew what needed to happen — we needed a home IP-based mesh network with low-power range,” says Fadell. “The key is it’s IP native.” Low-power radios in the smart home have needed a hub or bridge to talk to the internet, but that problem went away by making Thread IP native. “That is what is so powerful about it,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbCEvG"&gt;Eve was one of the first smart home companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;to adopt Thread&lt;/a&gt;, and today, it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22827727/eve-matter-thread-upgrade-smart-shades-release-date"&gt;working toward&lt;/a&gt; running all of its relevant products on the protocol, having shifted over from Bluetooth. “Thread has really changed the reliability of our product, especially in terms of automation,” says Eve’s Gackel. “The difference between our Bluetooth product and Thread product experience has really increased customer satisfaction.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzG3vv"&gt;Thread devices can be battery-powered or wall-powered, and the latter can be a Thread border router, a bridge between a Wi-Fi and Thread network. But a border router isn’t a typical white plastic box type of bridge that plugs into your router. The tech will be built into any device with an always-on power source and can be placed anywhere in your home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HhyyS"&gt;A smart plug, smart speaker, fridge, TV, thermostat, and Wi-Fi access point can all be Thread border routers. “As you add more border routers in the home, you get better range and reliability,” explains Kevin Po, senior product manager at Google and a member of the CSA board. Case in point, the aesthetically pleasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Nanoleaf Shapes and Elements light panels are also Thread border routers&lt;/a&gt;, with a smidge more pizazz than a white plastic box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPRjYl"&gt;A border router is like a mailman: it routes the different packets of information. Unlike a smart home hub, it doesn’t know what’s in those packets or control them. If a smart speaker wants to know the state of a lock, the border router can tell it without ever knowing the state itself. “From an end-to-end security perspective, that routing aspect provides a lot of benefits,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7H15wWa4XdQiKA-u_uMYDtxrcm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084334/Thread_home_network.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Thread Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image illustrates how Thread border routers connect a thread network to the internet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H2UoA3"&gt;While Z-Wave and Zigbee will continue to be part of the smart home — existing hubs can be upgraded to Thread or bridged to Matter — it seems possible these technologies will be phased out in the residential setting. “It would certainly seem, if everything is executed as promised, that it will make sense to move towards Matter products,” says Mitch Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance. “That’s a big ‘if,’ however, and there are other questions in terms of security still.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FH0cQK"&gt;Because Matter devices can speak straight to the internet, that potentially exposes them to hacking or malware, says Klein. &lt;a href="https://zigbeealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Matter-Security-Privacy_one-pager.pdf"&gt;Matter’s security approach&lt;/a&gt; is “strong, agile (to address the evolution of things like encryption types over time), and proactive, with a community of members who do threat modeling and mitigation,” says Richardson of the CSA. IP control is central to the function of Matter, and Richardson argues that the approach is one of resilient security while still getting the benefits of an IP-connected world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="NAK1hc"&gt;How will devices work in a Matter smart home?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="AOEu7g"&gt;The Matter home will need a Wi-Fi access point and a Matter controller. This can be a smartphone or tablet, but it can also be a Thread border router that works with your preferred smart home ecosystem — such as an Amazon Echo speaker, an Apple HomePod Mini, a Google Nest Hub, or a Samsung SmartThings hub. While devices will work across platforms, automations and routines will not. “If you are using HomeKit, you will need a HomeKit hub,” explains Gackel. “A Google hub will not run HomeKit automations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18wsbx"&gt;A Matter home will be able to incorporate any smart home device that is Matter certified. (The Matter logo on a product will indicate that it’s compatible.) You will also be able to set up any Matter device with your controller app, similar to how Apple’s HomeKit works today. All this means that when you buy a new product — such as a lightbulb or door lock — if it has a Matter logo, you won’t need to worry about what it works with; it will just work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzZFQeRI68rbbFLbOOvkuQFJUvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079854/acastro_4887_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="omRzdU"&gt;It will also be simpler to set up. Amazon’s Frustration-Free setup is the basis for Matter’s standard setup process, explains Chris DeCenzo, principal software development engineer at Amazon Lab126. It’s designed to enable a “zero-touch” experience, where you take the device out of the box, plug it in, and it connects to your home automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvYr8J"&gt;This doesn’t mean there won’t be manufacturer apps, just that you won’t have to use them for setup. Still, in some cases, you will need them to access device-specific features that aren’t available in Matter, and probably to update firmware, although this may happen through Matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="07kogK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies are committing to Matter, but some are still holding a few cards close to their chest.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ye0GAi"&gt;Despite the coming together of the big four smart home companies and the general excitement of the early Matter push, the reality is the smart home will still be a divided one. Matter may provide a basic standard of interoperability and portability, but companies will still seek competitive advantages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hf077"&gt;For example, nothing in the Matter spec requires a Matter controller to support all device categories. If video doorbells become part of Matter in the future, Amazon could choose not to support doorbells in its controller. Amazon’s Ring doorbells already work in the Ring app and with its Echo devices, meaning the company may see no need to develop another doorbell camera controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14a8Uc"&gt;There’s also nothing compelling companies to upgrade products that they don’t want to. Google has said it will update its newest Nest Smart Thermostat to Matter but has not said if any of the three generations of the Nest Learning Thermostat or the Thermostat E will follow suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9K51y"&gt;Amazon has released a slew of new smart home products in 2021, including a thermostat, air quality monitor, and smart switches, with not a mention of Matter compatibility. DeCenzo tells me this doesn’t mean it won’t come, but that’s not exactly a guarantee that it will. “It’s hard for a device maker to make any absolute statements about something they’re going to support that isn’t here today,” he says. “Matter was just an idea when these devices were being developed.”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSoSVS"&gt;Apple has committed to Matter but hasn’t commented on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22824559/matter-tv-streaming-devices-smart-home-casting-protocol-support"&gt;whether it will adopt the Matter TV and Streaming Video player specification&lt;/a&gt; to allow Matter controllers to cast content from smartphones to televisions, similar to how AirPlay works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvRGFc"&gt;On the one hand, companies are committing to Matter, but with the other hand they’re still holding some cards close to their chest. While it’s legitimately tricky to say how you will develop your products for a specification that hasn’t been finalized yet, these companies are all deeply involved in the process, so they are hardly flying blind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="9GBupl"&gt;How will companies differentiate themselves in Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="1PALNF"&gt;Before Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons for you to choose their devices over the competition. “What Matter does is change the game, so companies aren’t competing on connectivity and interoperability, and it’s just there,” says Michelle Mindala-Freeman, head of marketing at Connectivity Standards Alliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbAJeQ"&gt;This would appear to put the big four smart home platforms on an even playing field. If all devices talk to each other, you’re no longer locked into Google’s ecosystem because your preferred door lock only works with Google. While this would seem counter to Google, Amazon etc. selling more devices, what it does is make it easier for each company to innovate and move forward with their respective visions of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22719945/amazon-alexa-dave-limp-interview-ambient-computing-ring-eero-decoder"&gt;smart home&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuEoO9"&gt;Ultimately, if the hardware is commoditized, the value becomes in the service layer your ecosystem of choice adds to your experience. Matter’s specifications are designed to be simple: that door lock will lock and unlock. “Above that, it’s up to the device makers, the platform companies and such to understand how to best innovate,” says Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNHPu2ISjAQ9HIH0veWWCi2RLGo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079853/acastro_4887_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HQGuK0"&gt;If you want more advanced features — such as adaptive lighting or touch-to-unlock — you will go to a platform or manufacturer that supports those. “It will make for a more competitive environment,” says Kevin Kraus, of Yale Residential, part of Assa Abloy. “If you want a fully-featured door lock, you’re likely to buy a Yale lock. But let’s say you’ve got a shed, and you just need something that locks and unlocks, then you might go for something less sophisticated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQDR3K"&gt;Matter should push manufacturers to innovate, too. “We need to focus more on the added value of our products,” said Florian Deleuil of Netatmo in &lt;a href="https://matter-smarthome.de/en/interview-en/matter-is-pretty-changing-the-game/"&gt;a recent interview&lt;/a&gt;. “Otherwise, it could end up being difficult to distinguish our product from that of cheaper and less innovative suppliers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzVx9B"&gt;While it will be more competitive, the thinking is that the market will be much larger. Matter will help the smart home go from niche to mass. “If this is successful, everyone sells more,” says Z-Wave’s Klein. “Market penetration increases, the stagnation of the smart home in terms of growth is going to increase, and new product categories will open up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNKvkw"&gt;Today, you might choose a washing machine because it has an excellent design, a special cycle for athletic wear, and offers good energy and water efficiency. You don’t choose it because it works with Alexa or syncs with your fridge. Going forward, that’s probably how you’ll choose your next smart device. “Both industrial design, the overall physical user experience, and the feature sets that they virtually interact with will drive purchase decisions, not just who it works with,” says Klein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bs8hP"&gt;Matter will also provide wider choice. Today, you may be limited to devices that work with the platform you have set up. With Matter, that restriction should go away. The smart home future — where all devices communicate with each other to help your home run more efficiently, intelligently, and seamlessly — will finally emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj5xICvNyLceaIMRUUBHTfPr1fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23084331/matter_lkup_rgb_night.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="bNpJsc"&gt;But will it Matter?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="IdBNMP"&gt;In all of the interviews I did for this article, no one had anything negative to say about Matter (on the record). Right now, the industry is aligned on drinking the same Kool-Aid. But Matter is still an idea — albeit one with an unprecedented industry coalition behind it that makes it the most promising development in the smart home since Alexa arrived on the scene. It’s easy to love an idea; it can be harder to implement and stick to one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBsr0h"&gt;Matter’s biggest roadblock is that it’s not here yet, and whether it will arrive as promised is still a large question mark. This is holding some companies back from committing to it or developing products for it today. “We totally believe in the vision and in all the benefits that will come from having a single protocol,” says Amazon’s DeCenzo. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got to get there. And that’s going to be a journey.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Rns5ld"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work well with its platform? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt3pay"&gt;Fadell, who is as excited about the validation of his Thread gamble as a kid at Christmas, is also slightly skeptical. He worries that proprietary moves by companies looking to differentiate products could harm Matter’s overall promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niOU16"&gt;“Everything can talk to everything in Matter, but that doesn’t mean the experiences will be the same. I can speak French, but am I really French? No,” says Fadell. “It’s the same thing here. If you’re in the Apple ecosystem, sure you may work with other systems in certain ways — but inside Apple, with all the Apple tools, it will be a better experience, and it’s going to stay that way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x0NJ9"&gt;Yes, you will be able to use an Apple speaker to control an Amazon device, but is Apple going to go out of its way to make sure Amazon’s products work &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt; with its platform? “Unlikely,” says Fadell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP75wL"&gt;Ultimately, Matter isn’t the solution we — as consumers — have been waiting for. On day one, it’s not going to produce the ambient, self-aware smart home that can respond to your every need without a lick of set-up on our part. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQcQSu"&gt;What it is is the solution smart home developers need so that they can start building products and services for that smart home we’re waiting for. “If Matter only changes a couple of things, we will still have a fundamental new technology that works,” says Fadell. “And if it’s adopted — well, let’s see what happens then.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xR0aPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCXfRy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Tuesday, December 14, 10:55AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified what Matter-ready devices are -- those products manufacturers have said will be updated to Matter as soon as the specification is released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3v7Xn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Wednesday, December 15, 5:35PM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included the names of the other companies involved in the initial development of Thread.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu offers a first glimpse at Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0diSAU4MIy-sCWRBk_sp-VdfNho=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70279036/hulu_theranos_the_dropout.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hulu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="97Ck3p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.hulu.com/shows/the-dropout/"&gt;Hulu has finally given us a glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes in its own take on the real-life Silicon Valley drama. &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt; is a limited series that centers around Holmes’ fraudulent blood-testing startup, Theranos, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/10/18216012/dropout-podcast-abc-series-theranos-elizabeth-holmes"&gt;based on an ABC podcast&lt;/a&gt; that goes by the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPvlrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Naveen Andrews, best known for starring in &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, will play Sunny Balwani&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kQW7dj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305303/kate-mckinnon-will-play-elizabeth-holmes-in-theranos-miniseries-dropout-podcast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; star Kate McKinnon&lt;/a&gt; was originally supposed to take the leading role, but she reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/kate-mckinnon-hulu-the-dropout-elizabeth-holmes-1234910973/"&gt;dropped out of the production in February&lt;/a&gt;. Seyfried was confirmed to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/amanda-seyfried-elizabeth-holmes-hulu-the-dropout-kate-mckinnon-1234940063/"&gt;take McKinnon’s place&lt;/a&gt; back in March. So far, it looks like Seyfried fits the role quite nicely; she sports the same updo, red lipstick, and signature black turtleneck that Holmes is known for. Naveen Andrews, who previously starred in &lt;em&gt;Lost&lt;/em&gt;, will play Sunny Balwani, Holmes’ ex-boyfriend and former Theranos president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT7UZF"&gt;Just before things came crashing down, Theranos was valued at $9 billion, and Holmes was considered the youngest self-made female billionaire. The startup garnered funding from hopeful investors, who believed in the company’s non-existent ability to accurately perform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22834348/theranos-blood-testing-innovation-drop-holmes"&gt;dozens of tests using just a drop of blood&lt;/a&gt;. Holmes now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22792606/elizabeth-holmes-fraud-witness-stand-surprise"&gt;stands trial for 12 counts of wire fraud&lt;/a&gt; and conspiracy to commit wire fraud and faces up to 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgESbL"&gt;Rebecca Jarvis, Victoria Thompson, and Taylor Dunn, the same trio behind &lt;em&gt;The Dropout&lt;/em&gt; podcast, will be returning as executive producers on the show alongside showrunner Elizabeth Meriwether. The series is set to make its debut on Hulu on March 3rd, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824561/apple-theranos-elizabeth-homes-jennifer-lawrence-adam-mckay-bad-blood"&gt;Apple announced &lt;em&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, a movie that also follows the Theranos saga and stars Jennifer Lawrence as Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York becomes largest US city to ban new gas hookups</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9Wopu"&gt;The Big Apple just became the biggest city yet to say goodbye to gas hookups in new construction. New York City Council passed a &lt;a href="https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=4966519&amp;amp;GUID=714F1B3D-876F-4C4F-A1BC-A2849D60D55A&amp;amp;Options=&amp;amp;Search="&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt; today that prohibits the combustion of fossil&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fuels in new buildings, effectively phasing out the use of gas for cooking and heating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWjrJb"&gt;Addressing building emissions is critical to New York City meeting its &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/our-programs/carbon-neutral-nyc-pr-04-15-2021.page"&gt;climate goals&lt;/a&gt;; they’re responsible for &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/sustainability/codes/energy-benchmarking.page#:~:text=Over%2070%20percent%20of%20New,on%20energy%20and%20water%20management."&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the city’s greenhouse gas emissions. The ban will apply to structures under seven stories tall starting in 2024 and to larger buildings in 2027. The measure will drastically cut down on pollution that fuels climate change: according to a recent &lt;a href="https://rmi.org/stopping-gas-hookups-in-new-construction-in-nyc-would-cut-carbon-and-costs/"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; by clean energy think tank RMI, it’ll slash 2.1 million tons of CO2 emissions by 2040, which has about the same impact as taking 450,000 cars off the road for a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ihBHS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Buildings are big problem for New York City’s efforts to tackle climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VaGBZc"&gt;For years, the so-called natural gas industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22280080/natural-gas-stoves-air-pollution-climate-change-history"&gt;sold itself&lt;/a&gt; as a cleaner alternative to other fossil fuels&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;like oil. But scientists, and a growing number of cities, are no longer buying the argument. Natural gas is primarily methane, a greenhouse gas that has more than &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/understanding-global-warming-potentials"&gt;25 times&lt;/a&gt; the global warming effect of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timespan. Methane &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aar7204"&gt;leaks&lt;/a&gt; along the natural supply chain from wells to people’s homes. During a high-profile climate summit in November, the US joined over 100 other countries in &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_21_5766"&gt;pledging&lt;/a&gt; to cut methane emissions by 30 percent this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8u0zjf"&gt;Berkeley, California, became the first city in the US to ban gas hookups in new construction in 2019. Since then, the gas industry has &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/22/967439914/as-cities-grapple-with-climate-change-gas-utilities-fight-to-stay-in-business"&gt;fought back&lt;/a&gt; by lobbying for policies that prevent local governments from implementing such bans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hm37i"&gt;New York City’s new measure, which Mayor Bill de Blasio is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/15/nyregion/nyc-gas-stove-heat-ban.html"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to sign into law, is significant not only because of the city’s size but because of its colder climate. Gas proponents have argued that it would be too difficult to ax gas heating in places with cold winters because electric heaters might overwhelm the grid and lead to power outages. The bill calls for studies on the feasibility of using heat pump technology and on how the measure will impact the city’s electricity grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0nXFr"&gt;But the measure already has support from Con Edison, a utility that provides both electricity and gas to New Yorkers. The grid “is well-poised to support the transition to heating electrification,” it said in a November &lt;a href="https://www.coned.com/en/about-us/media-center/news/20211117/submitted-testimony-of-con-edison-city-council-environmental-protection-committee-oversight-hearing"&gt;testimony&lt;/a&gt; to city council. That’s because the grid usually sees peak demand during the summer when residents blast their air conditioning, it says, and electricity use is typically lower in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IuofLF"&gt;“New York City is taking a massive step off fossil fuels, paving the way for the rest of the state and country to follow,” Food &amp;amp; Water Watch northeast region director Alex Beauchamp said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple delays full office reopening and promises $1,000 equipment bonuses</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WsOlSF"&gt;Apple has indefinitely delayed the date which corporate employees will have to return to the office, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1471237100255252484"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News’&lt;/em&gt; Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. CEO Tim Cook sent an email to staff on Wednesday saying the return-to-work date is “yet to be determined.” The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the date hasn’t been determined. Cook also announced that Apple would be giving each corporate employee $1,000 to use for home office equipment, both Gurman and Schiffer reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YjAOP"&gt;The delay comes as COVID-19 cases rise and the omicron variant begins to spread. Workers were previously set to return to offices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; in a hybrid work pilot announced internally in November. That itself was already delayed; the company has shifted its plans in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633616/apple-delays-mandatory-office-return-january-covid-surge"&gt;past&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfoFF4"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22838172/apple-stores-close-retail-covid-19-cases-infections"&gt;closed three retail stores&lt;/a&gt; this week in response to growing COVID-19 infections. On Tuesday, it began requiring customers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;wear masks&lt;/a&gt; while inside its retail stores.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple closes three more retail stores as COVID-19 infections rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t79lnqUGVPOcFLxZr7K3KmONZxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278293/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sG1QiA"&gt;Apple has closed three of its retail stores following increased COVID-19 exposures and cases among employees, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-temporarily-shuts-three-retail-stores-after-covid-19-surge"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjqhNE"&gt;The stores, which are located in the Brickell City Centre in Miami; Annapolis, Maryland; and downtown Ottawa, Ontario, will be closed temporarily. Right now, Apple’s website says the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/brickellcitycentre/"&gt;Miami store&lt;/a&gt; is closed until Friday and the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/annapolis/"&gt;Annapolis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/"&gt;Ottawa&lt;/a&gt; stores are closed until Saturday. Apple reportedly closed a store in Southlake, Texas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826604/apple-store-closed-southlake-texas-covid-19-outbreak-black-friday"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; due to a COVID-19 outbreak, though the company’s website currently indicates &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/southlaketownsquare/"&gt;that store is open&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtBXPn"&gt;The closures are happening as COVID-19 infections are on the rise. Though the omicron variant is beginning to spread, the delta variant “continues to be the main variant circulating in the United States,” &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. On Tuesday, Apple once again began requiring customers to wear masks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834419/apple-retail-store-mask-requirement-december-2021-omicron-covid"&gt;inside its US retail stores&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UdCj7"&gt;“We regularly monitor conditions and we will adjust our health measures to support the wellbeing of customers and employees,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.” Employees at the closed stores will have to be tested prior to reopening, the spokesperson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwc7rS"&gt;Apple has also reportedly pushed back its plans to return its corporate workers to the office. Its latest plan was to have employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789631/apple-employees-return-offices-february-1st-hybrid-work-pilot"&gt;come back on February 1st&lt;/a&gt; under a hybrid work model, but that plan has been delayed to a “yet to be determined” date, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZoeSchiffer/status/1471236946160619524"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;’ Zoe Schiffer&lt;/a&gt;. An email from Tim Cook announced that employees would get $1,000 to spend on their home office, Schiffer reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6m6ul"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 15th, 5:14PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Apple delaying its return to the office.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Luna runs on Windows — and yet it’s hiring Linux gaming engineers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_SC4OhN135n0AMU0C_ytBlGlPgw=/0x41:861x615/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70278732/msedge_r3ufclrsdh.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2kLyH"&gt;When Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna launched last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455610/amazon-luna-game-streaming-windows-nvidia-gpu-servers"&gt;the fact it ran on Windows set it apart&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Google Stadia, it wouldn’t necessarily need to convince developers to painstakingly port their games to an unproven platform. But it now appears that Amazon is considering a shift to Linux-based servers, too — the company is hiring three software engineers to bring Windows games to Linux (via &lt;a href="https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;amp;px=Amazon-Linux-Graphics-Jobs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoronix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drT7AE"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; — an upcoming gaming handheld that also runs on Linux — the idea isn’t to abandon Windows games. Both the Steam Deck and Amazon’s seemingly new Luna initiative will still run Windows games, but both of them will do it &lt;em&gt;through &lt;/em&gt;Valve’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Proton compatibility layer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GN3vNt"&gt;“[T]his role involves working with Proton - a compatibility layer to run Windows games on Linux using Wine. Luna is committed to working with the open source community around Proton. This role will commit code to open source projects such as Proton and Wine in pursuit of running games in a stable and performant manner,” each of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840068/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840070/software-development-engineer-l5"&gt;job&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1840069/senior-software-engineer"&gt;descriptions&lt;/a&gt; reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5TxX4"&gt;All three jobs were posted on December 6th, and they also all mention “DXVK,” a helpful tool that translates from Microsoft’s Direct3D graphics APIs to Vulkan instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xuXLqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why Linux for Luna?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nLy4X6"&gt;It’s not quite clear why Amazon might want to adopt Linux; &lt;a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/amazon-looking-to-stream-windows-games-on-luna-via-linux/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neowin&lt;/em&gt; speculates&lt;/a&gt; it might be about keeping Amazon Luna’s games easily sandboxed so that new updates don’t break compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEwDRn"&gt;The Proton gaming community &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;will be quick to tell you&lt;/a&gt; that Windows games can often run well on Linux these days, though some have issues — and one category in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816279/valve-proton-battleye-anti-cheat-dayz-linux-steam-deck"&gt;multiplayer games with anti-cheat software&lt;/a&gt;, can be problematic. Valve is pushing to improve that in time for the Steam Deck’s launch in February, though, and now it seems Amazon may help convince developers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WlodIH"&gt;We don’t have any indications whether Amazon Luna has been a success. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;We weren’t very impressed in our launch hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve heard it’s gotten better since. It generally gets even less buzz than Google Stadia, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300851/amazon-marc-whitten-fire-tv-luna-cloud-gaming-unity-role"&gt;it lost its head executive in February&lt;/a&gt;. But whether Amazon will follow through with gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;has been an existential question, period&lt;/a&gt;, and yet the company finally has a hit in &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, which has continually kept a place on Steam’s top 10 list of the most-played games since its September launch. Maybe things are looking up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30laMt"&gt;There’s an unusual opportunity for cloud gaming companies right now because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;next-gen consoles&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22698588/falcodrin-gpu-hunters-nvidia-amd-graphics-card-tricks-bots-scalpers-miners-gamers"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; are so hard to find and so expensive to buy. Amazon has suggested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22663690/amazon-new-world-luna-cloud-gaming"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; might come to Luna, too&lt;/a&gt;, and if it does, it’ll be interesting to see if that spurs a wave of adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCyyDJ"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW4HQm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
