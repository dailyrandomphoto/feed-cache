    <title>Activision Blizzard board rallies around embattled CEO hours after damning report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sis7keCzVJaNg09tp9YxRqV-pL8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151045/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snLRLS"&gt;Hours after &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;shocking report&lt;/a&gt; alleging Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company, the company’s board of directors &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-issues-statement-regarding"&gt;posted a statement voicing its support of the CEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOG3bu"&gt;The board’s language shows no indication that Kotick is in danger of losing his job. “The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick’s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals,” the statement concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYbj8R"&gt;Here is the board of directors’ statement in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlUIU4"&gt;The Activision Blizzard Board remains committed to the goal of making Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the industry. Under Bobby Kotick’s leadership the Company is already implementing industry leading changes including a zero tolerance harassment policy, a dedication to achieving significant increases to the percentages of women and non-binary people in our workforce and significant internal and external investments to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent. The Board remains confident that Bobby Kotick appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTVVRs"&gt;The goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious. The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick’s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oaBvew"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report also alleged that Kotick harassed one of his assistants more than a decade ago, which included a death threat. Kotick settled the matter out of court, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPlKyo"&gt;The statement arrives shortly after A Better ABK, an advocacy group formed by employees, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329"&gt;said that it would&lt;/a&gt; “not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO” and that it would be staging a walkout on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches new website for reporting its Top 10 titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BN17n-RWMy-xtKG_tuhSUiyuCM=/314x0:3689x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150947/still_mobile_EN.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADjjaG"&gt;After announcing last month that it will begin to shift the way it ranks its top titles, Netflix today is launching a new website where it will share those metrics every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWXESh"&gt;During its earnings call in October, the company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735379/netflix-changing-ranking-metric-popular-titles-hours-viewed"&gt;shift away&lt;/a&gt; from its longtime two-minute viewing time metric to instead rank titles by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;total number of hours&lt;/a&gt; viewed. The new &lt;a href="https://top10.netflix.com/"&gt;weekly Top 10 hub&lt;/a&gt; will update every Tuesday with lists of its top films and series in the following categories: Films (English), Films (Non-English), TV (English), and TV (Non-English). Each list will display the number of hours each top-ranking TV show or movie was watched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBeB4DEhtuwwqaBBpBWo_RgA0Io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019306/Top_10_TV__English__November_8___November_14.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy62sf"&gt;Each list will track the success of Netflix content during the prior Monday through Sunday period before being published Tuesday. According to the company, the lists will count seasons of series as separate titles, but it will count repeated watches within a season toward that season’s overall watch hours, for example, if you watch a scene in a single episode repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxCmKo"&gt;All content on Netflix’s app is eligible to appear on these lists, including both its original and licensed shows and movies. The company will also disclose its most popular shows and movies of all time for the aforementioned four categories. As a caveat, however, the company said its figures are “rounded to 10,000 to account for any fluctuations in Internet connectivity around the world.” Titles are ranked based on their first 28 days on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NpHmzE6PSrz2MXZKzJnap43-Lus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019309/Top_10_Films__Non_English__November_8___November_14.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Iq5J"&gt;While the data will shift which titles rank highest, as the company demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;slides it shared&lt;/a&gt; during Code 2021 this year, Netflix said in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735379/netflix-changing-ranking-metric-popular-titles-hours-viewed"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; last month that it believes “engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction.” The company said the move is part of an initiative for greater transparency around viewing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXCbJl"&gt;The new metric will also more closely align Netflix with other viewing metrics, the company said last month, and will give “proper credit to rewatching.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s $7.5 billion EV charging plan will require a lot of patience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Vehicle in Maryland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9leV7Soi6mCH08a0TN4WqTLt884=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150736/1235384443.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZCprrT"&gt;The Biden administration’s effort to blanket the country in half a million new EV chargers in the next half-decade got $7.5 billion in funding Monday when the president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;signed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; into law. But while those chargers will be necessary as electric vehicle sales continue to climb, Biden’s plan will require institutional — and personal — patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgW42u"&gt;Not only will it simply take a while to build out that many chargers, but the majority of what gets built will likely be of the “Level 2” variety, which can replenish about 25 miles of battery capacity per hour. That means EV buyers in the US will have to get used to the idea of sipping energy while they’re out and about and doing most of their charging at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RO7aA"&gt;“The use case we think will be the most frequent is you’re doing something else in your life — you’re at the grocery store, or the movies, or church — and you’re just going to plug in there,” says Joe Britton, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “[That’s] instead of the gas station model, which is like, ‘Oh shoot, I’m on empty, I need to go and get all the way to full &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWrqV5"&gt;This is, by all accounts, how &lt;a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/us-infrastructure-bills-ev-charger-funding.html"&gt;most current EV owners handle charging&lt;/a&gt;. But it could prove to be an obstacle for some buyers in our petrol-centric society. At least one study already found that the top reason causing EV owners to switch back to a gas-powered car &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;was the inconvenience of charging&lt;/a&gt;. But another shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/as-more-americans-choose-evs-price-and-range-continue-to-hold-back-the-market-according-to-new-cox-automotive-study/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social-org&amp;amp;utm_content=news"&gt;percentage of people worrying about a lack of charging is dropping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ombJxo"&gt;The infrastructure bill does allow for funding to go to new DC Fast charging stations. (Same with hydrogen fueling stations.) But Level 2 chargers are far cheaper to build and install, meaning the administration can get more of them for the same amount of money. Level 2 chargers only cost a few thousand dollars to get in the ground, while faster chargers can be 50 to 100 times as expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J1Oeop"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EV charging in the US is broken — can Joe Biden fix it?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jsL2Kg"&gt;Focusing on Level 2 chargers makes it possible for them to become a ubiquitous technology, Britton says. In turn, that will make it easier for people to charge while running errands or at work since there will (hopefully) be less competition for a plug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke7JEg"&gt;Building out hundreds of thousands of Level 2 chargers should also make finding one feel less like a burden. Many current chargers are scattered in dark corners of hotel parking lots, often with just a handful of hookups. Making them easier to find will help encourage people to top up their cars’ battery packs while on the go, Britton says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZsjTw"&gt;The language of the infrastructure bill related to EV charging is pretty broad, but it at least is focused on making these new chargers easy to access. They must be built in publicly accessible locations like parks, shopping centers, multiunit housing structures, government-owned buildings, or at transit hubs. They can be installed on private property but only if they’re accessible for a minimum amount of time per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6DiBW"&gt;Moreover, companies applying for funding to build out more chargers can’t use a proprietary plug and have to work with local governments to figure out a long-term maintenance plan so the stations aren’t abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJUY2A"&gt;It’s hard to know what exact shape this world of new chargers will look like until companies start requesting funds and local governments start doling them out. But while it’s not as ambitious a commitment as the $15 billion Biden originally wanted for EV charging infrastructure, people like Britton and Jonathan Levy, the chief commercial officer of EVgo, see it as a crucial step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dj6XfF"&gt;“The specifics on the numbers aren’t as important as the direction” things are going, Levy said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “What we need from the tailwinds of policy is the support to accelerate ahead of full EV adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKzDc4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuG5wb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VR treatment for chronic pain gets FDA authorization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rj3sSMf-vicK-G7cEPztL9S47Bc=/0x0:880x587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150630/AppliedVR_shot_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Applied VR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eq1pok"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration authorized a virtual reality system as a prescription treatment for chronic back pain, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-virtual-reality-system-chronic-pain-reduction"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The therapy, called EaseVRx, joins the &lt;a href="https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/digital-therapeutics-for-substance-use-disorders-from-research-to-practice"&gt;short list&lt;/a&gt; of digital therapeutics cleared by the agency over the past few years.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFDZUi"&gt;EaseVRx includes a VR headset and a device that amplifies the sound of the user’s breath to assist in breathing exercises. It uses principles from cognitive behavior therapy, which aims to help people recognize and understand various thought patterns and emotions. The program addresses pain through relaxation, distraction, and improved awareness of internal signals, the FDA said in its statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCAqGh"&gt;The FDA authorized EaseVRx based on &lt;a href="https://www.jmir.org/2021/2/e26292/"&gt;data from an eight-week study&lt;/a&gt; in 179 people with low back pain that had lasted six months or longer. Half used the EaseVRx program and half participated in another, two-dimensional virtual reality program that did not use cognitive behavioral therapy methods. Around two-thirds of participants using EaseVRx said they had more than 30 percent reduction in pain, while only 41 percent of the control group had a similar reduction. The reduced pain lasted for up to three months after the study for people in the EaseVRx group but not for the control group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTyDJ"&gt;The VR system could be an alternative option to opioid medications for back pain, Christopher Loftus, acting director of the Office of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices at the FDA, said &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-marketing-virtual-reality-system-chronic-pain-reduction"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. Research shows that psychological approaches &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/5/17/17276452/chronic-pain-treatment-psychology-cbt-mindfulness-evidence"&gt;can be effective treatments&lt;/a&gt; for chronic pain for some people, and proponents stress that targeting those components to pain doesn’t mean the pain is any less real. Still, cognitive behavioral therapy for pain is &lt;a href="https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/2021/11/11/how-cbt-harmed-me-the-interview-that-the-new-york-times-erased/"&gt;sometimes controversial&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/apr/07/chronic-pain-sufferers-should-take-exercise-not-analgesics-says-nice?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;efforts to integrate it&lt;/a&gt; into standard care have been met with &lt;a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/health/chronic-pain-guidelines-treatment-cbt-acupuncture-first-point-946088"&gt;worries&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be used as an excuse to pull people off &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/amid-the-opioid-crisis-some-seriously-ill-people-risk-losing-drugs-they-depend-on/2018/07/13/65850640-730d-11e8-805c-4b67019fcfe4_story.html"&gt;needed medications&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zprlqj"&gt;EaseVRx was developed by the company AppliedVR, which is &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/appliedvr-testing-use-at-home-virtual-reality-therapy-for-chronic-pain"&gt;also testing&lt;/a&gt; its platform as a treatment for fibromyalgia pain, burn pains, or pain during childbirth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkukQv"&gt;Its clearance for back pain comes around a month after the FDA approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736894/fda-vr-tv-movies-treatment-lazy-eye-amblyopia"&gt;another VR treatment&lt;/a&gt;, used to treat a visual disorder in children. The agency has also cleared a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21292267/fda-adhd-video-game-prescription-endeavor-rx-akl-t01-project-evo"&gt;prescription video game&lt;/a&gt; called EndeavorRx to treat ADHD in kids between eight and 12 years old.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s ‘Get It Today’ lets you pick up your online order at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-fRT1P94ksljl3A9zhUUSb4aSco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150608/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PJDK3J"&gt;If you’re tired of long shipping times, Samsung is now partnering with Best Buy to offer a “Get It Today” pickup option. This lets you make a purchase on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and then pick it up for free within just a few hours at your local Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wt6GnUyzYIVvdfjyfX6swE4MLkM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019371/get_today_bestbuy.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Get It Today” option on Samsung’s website lets you choose a Best Buy store for pickup.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psFl6v"&gt;Select Samsung phones, tablets, laptops, smartwatches, and portable audio devices are all eligible for same-day pickup at Best Buy. Once you’re at the checkout, just select “Get It Today” from the pickup / delivery options, and then choose the nearest Best Buy location. After you enter your payment information, just keep in mind that the shipping option defaults to home delivery for some reason, so you’ll have to change that back to your preferred Best Buy store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMrODY"&gt;The service sort of acts like a Best Buy availability tracker, considering that the devices are already in the Best Buy locations where you pick them up. So, you might be thinking: why not just go to Best Buy and buy the Samsung product there? The only advantage to ordering it directly from Samsung and picking it up in-store is that you can get deals exclusive to Samsung, as well as trade-in discounts, all while getting your order the same day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PsVW0V"&gt;It’s also worth noting that while Samsung does provide free same-day delivery to your doorstep, it’s only limited to Dallas and New York City. What would be a little more exciting, though, is if Samsung started offering the same option all across the US. Best Buy already offers &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmisc%2Fsame-day-delivery%2Fpcmcat748300518938.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300518938&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same-day delivery&lt;/a&gt; everywhere, which — despite not being able to get a Samsung-exclusive discount — might make it a more attractive option for someone who wants the convenience of shipping to their home. Plus, Best Buy offers same-day pickup for any product, including Apple, so Samsung offering the same isn’t that noteworthy. Not to mention, Apple itself also offers &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/shipping-pickup"&gt;express in-store pickup&lt;/a&gt; at its stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XBHs9"&gt;All in all, the “Get It Today” feature only really comes in handy if you want to take advantage of Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/gift-ideas/early-offer-signup/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; or another discount but don’t want to wait for your order to be shipped to your house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FbPtsx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard’s rot goes all the way to the CEO, alleges bombshell report</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oM6ztQ"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has been aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years and has had his own history of harassment and abusive behavior, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;bombshell report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl34EJ"&gt;The report contains many shocking and previously unreported allegations about Activision Blizzard, which has been under intense scrutiny following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;state of California’s July lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging the company has a culture of “constant sexual harassment.” The problems appear to go all the way to the top, as the new &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report contains numerous troubling stories of Kotick’s awareness of problems and of his own behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUBN34"&gt;In one instance, Kotick was aware that a former female employee at an Activision-owned studio alleged she was raped by her male supervisor, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, but Kotick reportedly kept this information from his own board of directors and didn’t tell them about the eventual settlement with the employee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcgaC2"&gt;Here is one particularly horrifying story about Kotick’s own alleged behavior:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="eneGcb"&gt;In 2006, one of his assistants complained that he had harassed her, including by threatening in a voice mail to have her killed, according to people familiar with the matter. He settled the matter out of court, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6SV1Am"&gt;And another:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="vyifd7"&gt;In 2007, he was sued by the flight attendant on a private jet he co-owned. The flight attendant claimed the plane’s pilot had sexually harassed her, and, after she complained to the other owner, Mr. Kotick fired her. The defendants denied the allegations. In a separate action related to legal fees in the case, an arbitrator, citing what he said was sworn testimony, wrote that Mr. Kotick told the flight attendant and her attorneys, “I’m going to destroy you.” A spokesman for Mr. Kotick denied that he said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHmAVy"&gt;In 2008, they settled by paying the attendant $200,000, according to the arbitrator’s decision. A spokesman for Mr. Kotick said he couldn’t have fired her in retaliation for complaining because she never complained directly to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77ORE9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also reports that &lt;em&gt;Kotick himself&lt;/em&gt; was the one who drafted the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;widely criticized letter&lt;/a&gt; that was supposedly written by Activision Blizzard exec Frances Townsend. Townsend, a woman, was publicly shamed and saw calls for her resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AV0HLs"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; letter&lt;/a&gt; shared publicly shortly after, Kotick apologized for the “Townsend letter,” saying “our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf.” He apparently didn’t see fit to mention that he drafted it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dxElT"&gt;A company spokesperson appeared to confirm his involvement with the “Townsend letter” by telling the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that Kotick takes responsibility for and regrets his participation. “Ms. Townsend should not be blamed for this mistake,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJXL0m"&gt;In that second Kotick memo, he announced that Activision Blizzard had hired an independent law firm to review the company’s practices — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;known union-busting law firm WilmerHale&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, the state of California has accused Activision Blizzard and WilmerHale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640302/california-activision-blizzard-lawsuit-update-withholding-info-expanded-victims"&gt;of “withholding and suppressing evidence.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUkqN8"&gt;Another shocking revelation from the new &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report is about Jen Oneal, who stepped down as co-lead of Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;three months after taking the role&lt;/a&gt;. She was appointed co-head of the studio in August alongside former Xbox exec Mike Ybarra after previous Blizzard president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;J. Allen Brack left the company&lt;/a&gt;. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, just one month after being appointed, Oneal wrote an email to the company’s legal team saying that she had been sexually harassed while at Activision Blizzard, that she was being paid less than Ybarra, and that she wanted to resign. “I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against,” Oneal wrote, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv0z5N"&gt;This summary only scratches the surface of what’s included in the report, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;which you should read in full&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3VU07"&gt;An Activision Blizzard spokesperson shared this statement in response to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s questions about the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y8SHHc"&gt;We are disappointed in the Wall Street Journal’s report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO. Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry’s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their – and our - values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick’s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nNevsb"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, WSJ&lt;/em&gt; spokesperson Steve Severinghaus said that “nothing in Activision Blizzard’s statement challenges the facts in our reporting.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2fpDJ"&gt;Kotick also pushed back on the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report in a video message sent to employees on Tuesday and subsequently shared with the world in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2021/11/a-message-from-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;a written transcript&lt;/a&gt;. While he doesn’t commit to any new changes at the company, he does reiterate that “as I have made clear, we are moving forward with a new zero tolerance policy for inappropriate behavior — and zero means zero. Any reprehensible conduct is simply unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5m3yJK"&gt;In response, A Better ABK, an advocacy group formed by Activision Blizzard employees, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329"&gt;said that it&lt;/a&gt; “will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO.” The group says it will be hosting a walkout on Tuesday. Employees also walked out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YRepa9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy.  We will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO, and continue to hold our original demand for Third-Party review by an employee-chosen source.  We are staging a Walkout today. We welcome you to join us.&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alktst"&gt;In October, Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;took a massive pay cut&lt;/a&gt; and said that the company would be waiving forced arbitration for sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company and many senior execs, including Kotick, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684779/activision-blizzard-investigation-sec-activision-bobby-kotick"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify, Discord, and others are coming back online after a brief Google Cloud outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVNx-BX57ofAIk0zIwy_NEwi-rk=/68x0:728x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150358/image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKrPnB"&gt;Sites and services like Spotify, Discord, Snapchat, and Etsy seem to be recovering after an outage that brought them, and many other sites, down for a little less than an hour on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0XrfL"&gt;The culprit for the outages appears to have been Google Cloud, and &lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/"&gt;the service’s status page&lt;/a&gt; still shows a networking issue is currently causing problems resulting in the 404 errors that appeared on affected web pages. An update to the status page posted at 1:17PM ET says “the issue with Cloud Networking is partially resolved,” and it does seem like most services are coming back to life, albeit with some experiencing a few bugs or long loading times. Google’s status page notes that there currently isn’t an ETA on when the problem will be fully fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U8WaFj"&gt;A peek at DownDetector shows the sprawling impact of the issue, with everything from Pokémon Go to Home Depot experiencing issues. We’ve reached out to some of the affected companies and will update this post as more information becomes available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfrt8G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/6PM5mNd43NbMqjCZ5REh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Cloud Status Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yraHtf"&gt;Summary: Global: Experiencing Issue with Cloud networking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq85jp"&gt;Description: We are experiencing an issue with Cloud Networking beginning at Tuesday, 2021-11-16 09:53 US/Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XBGYnG"&gt;Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PM95Vh"&gt;We will provide an update by Tuesday, 2021-11-16 10:40 US/Pacific with current details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l6BPI"&gt;We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KHfrp"&gt;Diagnosis: Customers may encounter 404 errors when accessing web pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwe9NS"&gt;Workaround: None at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="Vlhg6x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware of some issues right now and are checking them out! We’ll keep you posted.&lt;/p&gt;— Spotify Status (@SpotifyStatus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyStatus/status/1460668396824154115?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="BUf2YW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Rocket League and Rocket League Sideswipe are both experiencing services outages. Matchmaking, Parties, and more may not be available at this time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Updates to follow, and go to &lt;a href="https://t.co/FeCnPA9Ksi"&gt;https://t.co/FeCnPA9Ksi&lt;/a&gt; for more details. &lt;a href="https://t.co/lnI0i1WgFl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/lnI0i1WgFl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rocket League Status (@RL_Status) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RL_Status/status/1460669785176301571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7krI20"&gt;The tracker &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that many of the services started experiencing issues at the same time,  which points to a common provider experiencing issues, rather than something like an ISP disruption or individual sites coincidentally having issues at the same time. Similar to previous outages that came from problems at Fastly or AWS, the reliance of services on other providers can help them offer content at a massive scale, but if there’s a problem, then all of them can go down at once.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xtBYke"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 16th, 1:30M ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted updates from Google Cloud and that services are coming back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is getting a new Media Player app you can test today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXENMFZ_CYrgE64C4L_GpC5hARU=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150419/MainScreen.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new media player.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rh4BP0"&gt;Microsoft has created a new Media Player app for Windows 11, and it’s beginning to test the app with Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel today. The redesigned Media Player app will support both audio and video, and it includes a design that better matches Windows 11’s UI improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDzyDx"&gt;“At the heart of Media Player is a full-featured music library that allows you to quickly browse and play music, as well as create and manage playlists,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/16/new-media-player-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/"&gt;explains Dave Grochocki&lt;/a&gt;, a senior program manager lead for Microsoft’s Windows inbox apps team. “The update to the new Media Player will replace the Groove Music app.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8j5Cedbhli_tSwZ0uo4XagZwnaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019276/Playback_Music.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new artist imagery in Media Player.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oOSLCj"&gt;The playback view in this new Media Player app includes album art or artist imagery, which will appear both in full-screen modes and the mini player option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvDXb1"&gt;Media Player will also support video, which is usually handled in Windows 10 and Windows 11 in a separate Films &amp;amp; TV app. “All your content in the music and video folders on your PC will appear automatically in your library, but you can also tell Media Player where to look for additional content in app settings,” says Grochocki.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhTTkZOuWVjilguF0IHHP0lTrf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019279/Playback_Video.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video is also supported in this Windows 11 Media Player app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eDMfM"&gt;It’s clear this Media Player app is also designed to replace the legacy Windows Media Player app that still exists in Windows 11 today. Microsoft says this legacy app will continue to be available in Windows Tools, but it looks like the new Media Player for Windows 11 will be the primary way to watch video and listen to audio in the operating system soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyCveG"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test this new Media Player app with Windows 11 testers in the Dev Channel today, but the company hasn’t committed to a date for when all Windows 11 users will get this new app yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s sci-fi haptic glove prototype lets you feel VR objects using air pockets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Meta haptic glove prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cseyY47bU39t0JFgbVGQSWnERjA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150322/RL___Haptic_Glove_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Meta Reality Labs&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="irs7Vf"&gt;You cannot pet a dog in Meta’s new, high-tech virtual reality gloves. But researchers are getting closer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PCp0P"&gt;Meta (formerly Facebook) is known for its high-profile moves into virtual and augmented reality. For seven years, though, it’s been quietly working on one of its most ambitious projects yet: a haptic glove that reproduces sensations like grasping an object or running your hand along a surface. While Meta’s not letting the glove out of its Reality Labs research division, the company is showing it off for the first time today, and it sees the device — alongside other wearable tech — as the future of VR and AR interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IMNP4"&gt;At a simplified level, Meta’s haptics prototype is a glove lined with around 15 ridged and inflatable plastic pads known as actuators. The pads are arranged to fit along the wearer’s palm, the underside of their fingers, and their fingertips. The glove also acts as a VR controller. The back features small white markers that let cameras track how the fingers move through space, and it’s got internal sensors that capture how the wearer’s fingers are bending.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Reality Labs haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rGGnMyO-l4Ud2KaRFS9C2aInuew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019162/RL___Haptic_Glove_1scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OuQocj"&gt;When you put on the glove and enter a VR or AR experience, a sophisticated control system adjusts the level of inflation, creating pressure on different parts of your hand. If you’re touching a virtual object with your fingertips, you’ll feel the sensation of that object pressing into your skin. If you’re gripping a virtual item, the long finger actuators will stiffen, creating a sensation of resistance. These sensations work alongside visual and audio cues to produce the illusion of physical touch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONZF7h"&gt;The tech draws on the relatively new field of soft robotics, replacing bulky motors with tiny air valves. Meta has been working on it nearly since it acquired the Oculus VR startup in 2014. It developed its first prototype — one finger with a single actuator — in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="piEsek"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reality Labs has been working on this prototype for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KQwuk"&gt;One of the first experiences that Reality Labs head Michael Abrash recalls was looking at a virtual plate from inside a VR headset — where a single actuator, combined with the virtual image and the sound of rubbing the rough ceramic, was incredibly convincing. “I saw the plate, and I saw my finger on the plate, and I heard the sound — that kind of scraping sound across it — and I felt the vibration,” he says. “And I will tell you, I was running my finger over a ceramic plate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHGNYM"&gt;Simulated touch isn’t an entirely new phenomenon. Even combining VR with something as simple as controller vibrations can make people feel more like they’re touching something, and many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/13/5805628/at-e3-virtual-reality-goes-beyond-goggles"&gt;have worked on wearables&lt;/a&gt; that either track users’ hands or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037855/teslasuit-glove-vr-haptic-feedback-glove-announce-pricing-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;provide haptic sensation&lt;/a&gt;. Some even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14773870/axonvr-haptx-vr-haptic-box-pressure-temperature-gdc-2017"&gt;integrate temperature sensations&lt;/a&gt;, which Reality Labs isn’t prioritizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trgBiY"&gt;But Meta is poised to mass-market haptic gloves in a way other companies can’t. Most haptics device makers sell specialized products for military, industrial, or academic institutions. By contrast, Meta produces the dominant consumer-oriented Quest VR system and is putting billions of dollars toward &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;building a “metaverse” that integrates VR and AR&lt;/a&gt;. If it launches a haptic glove system, Meta can guarantee the system will work on the Quest and encourage app developers to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGAFXZ"&gt;Reality Labs imagines gloves being one of multiple controller methods for future glasses and headsets, alongside more lightweight solutions built on electromyography or EMG — a system that reads nerve signals on your arm and translates them into digital input. Meta acquired EMG wristband company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;CTRL-Labs in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and the EMG team works separately from the haptic design team, although the two technologies could easily overlap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GktEq7"&gt;“[Doug] Engelbart and Xerox PARC are the only time that fundamentally the way we interact with the digital world has ever changed,” Abrash says — referring to the invention of the mouse and the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerox_Alto"&gt;Alto desktop computer design&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s, something that helped set the course of modern personal computing. “AR glasses are going to require that to happen. You’re not going to walk around with a keyboard and mouse. You’re not going to be taking out your phone to interact with it.” For some tasks, you might want a simple wristband. For others, you’d want fuller tactile sensations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpxzSX"&gt;There are still many barriers to producing consumer-ready haptic gloves, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pFfniy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With garments in general, we expect them to be washable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZWL48"&gt;On one hand, the team wants to dramatically increase glove actuator density, going from tens to hundreds or even thousands within a few years. Right now, the gloves can offer a sense of objects’ contours, but not fine distinctions between surfaces — it relies instead on the suggestive power of audio and images. “You could pet a dog, but you wouldn’t feel the texture,” says Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy. “You need high-density actuation to be able to really get that sensation, and this glove does not do that.” Meta might not be prioritizing something as specific as fur, but it wants to produce more broadly high-quality sensation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVfjP0"&gt;On the other hand — or more literally, the same hand — the gloves need a dramatic size reduction. Meta’s prototype is svelter than something like a ‘90s Nintendo Power Glove, but that’s not saying much. Healy says the device needs to be light enough that people feel like they can normally interact with the real world as well as the virtual one, and it needs to go fully wireless, rather than relying on a tether like it does now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Meta Reality Labs engineer Katherine Healy with a haptic glove" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3z0lTtV9DK_xG9KLGR3_bqnIfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019166/RL___Kate_Healyscaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V94xtc"&gt;To make things even more complicated, haptic gloves need to fit precisely against wearers’ skin. That could require designing differently fitting versions for each buyer, possibly through a process like 3D knitting, which can &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/08/3d-knitting-weaving-spinning-printing#:~:text=3D%20knitting%20takes%20a%20digital,get%20on%20with%20its%20job."&gt;produce an object of clothing from a custom-sized digital design&lt;/a&gt;. Then there are practical questions like how to clean a high-tech glove — right now, it’s carefully wiped down with alcohol. “With garments in general, we expect them to be washable,” says Healy. “We would love to be able to create a glove that could be washed. How? We don’t know yet. But that’s part of our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYo3FS"&gt;If the gloves are commercialized, they’ll face the same privacy and security challenges as other wearables that collect biometric information. Abrash compares using technology like EMG wristbands to typing on a keyboard, something that’s rarely described as a potential threat. But wearable technology can analyze people’s physical motion at a fine level, while even basic typing patterns can &lt;a href="https://news.mit.edu/2015/typing-patterns-diagnose-early-onset-parkinsons-0401"&gt;predict the onset&lt;/a&gt; of diseases like Parkinson’s. Meta will need to establish policies governing how much of that data leaves users’ devices and who else has access to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="4SBoa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6pBYdx"&gt;For now, the team is just trying to work out how real is real &lt;em&gt;enough &lt;/em&gt;for VR touch. “One of the interesting things about haptic gloves is that obviously we can’t reproduce reality exactly, which is different from audiovisual stuff,” says Abrash. A super-dense screen could be almost distinguishable from a real image, and a sound wave could capture the sensation of hearing somebody speak. But Meta can’t realistically make a glove that will stop your hand from going through a virtual table. Instead, it has to find the point where you’ll suspend disbelief and accept that the table is there, even if it objectively feels more like jello than hard wood. “There’s a new physics where nothing is solid on a large scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpD5s2"&gt;And as for the dog? “It seems likely to me that if the haptic gloves work out, you’ll be able to pet a dog, but it will be a virtual dog and it will be a slightly different experience,” says Abrash. “But basically — emotionally, experientially — it will feel as real.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10 on Arm will no longer get x64 app emulation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GRSqmI"&gt;Microsoft started testing x64 emulation for Windows 10 on Arm nearly a year ago, but the company is now limiting the feature to Windows 11. The planned feature allows x64 apps that haven’t been compiled for Arm-powered machines to run, allowing devices like the Surface Pro X to access even more apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omjYY2"&gt;“x64 emulation for Windows is now generally available in Windows 11,” reads an &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/"&gt;update to a Microsoft blog post&lt;/a&gt; today. “For those interested in experiencing this, a PC running Windows 11 on Arm is required.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Mgae"&gt;That means if you were testing the feature on Windows 10, it’s no longer going to ship in any future operating system updates. You’ll need to upgrade a device like a Surface Pro X to Windows 11, instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O77AuT"&gt;Microsoft says it’s still committed to “supporting customers on Windows 10 on Arm through October 14, 2025,” but the lack of x64 app emulation will certainly force many on Qualcomm-powered hardware over to Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDgopE"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t detailed why it’s decided to drop x64 emulation on Windows 10 on Arm, but the company is also announcing it’s accelerating the rollout of Windows 11 faster than the company previously anticipated. That means even more devices will be eligible for the free upgrade, and hopefully more Arm-powered ones.&lt;/p&gt;
