    <title>Pokémon might be famous for its games, but it also has some great gadgets</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcuZGO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; might be renowned for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22289300/pokemon-25-anniversary-red-blue-gameboy-nintendo-co-op"&gt;cooperative gameplay&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296948/pokemon-25th-anniversary-spinoffs-go-snap-detective-pikachu"&gt; delightful spinoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297722/pokemon-25-anniversary-approachable-rpg-game-nintendo"&gt;making an intimidating genre approachable&lt;/a&gt;, but the franchise also has a long history of creative and interesting gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9GJsp"&gt;The series is bursting with technology. The original in-game pokédex clearly takes inspiration from early Palm Pilot-like devices, for example. And if you think about them, pokéballs are technological marvels: they somehow transform living creatures into particles that can be transported across the world (and in the TV show, the pokéballs can even shrink). So it’s not all that surprising that there have been many &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;-themed toys and hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEasGM"&gt;We’ve collected just a few of the many memorable &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; gadgets in honor of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the series’ 25th anniversary&lt;/a&gt;. The IRL devices range from gamified pedometers to custom video game consoles to actual pokéball replicas (though they can’t turn living things into particles just yet). There’s a lot of gear you can get if you want to catch ‘em all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UjJIFN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t4UIYzepWgw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rWN4qA"&gt;An actual pokédex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ALIwJP"&gt;Tiger Electronics and Hasbro released a toy pokédex in the late ‘90s, and I still consider it one of my favorite toys of all time. It was modeled after &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8ziMBZCJgvg"&gt;Ash’s pokédex&lt;/a&gt; from the first season of the TV show, though with a few different features to allow it to actually function as a real-life toy. It had a keypad and a number pad for searching information, a small screen that showed the pokémon you were looking at, and could show information about each pokémon like its height, weight, type, and some attacks it could learn. It made me feel like I was a bona fide pokémon trainer, and I remember spending hours reading up on different pokémon with my pokédex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xogj4D"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bDBa8zsyxF4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X6Yb9u"&gt;Pokémon Pikachu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rPSO4h"&gt;My Pokémon Pikachu was a staple of my childhood. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990218041314/http://www.nintendo.com/corp/press/110698.html"&gt;Released in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, it was a pocket-sized gadget that was kind of like a Tamagotchi, except you took care of a digital Pikachu. But it also had a built-in pedometer that you could activate just by shaking the device up and down. (Or, like in the commercials embedded above, jumping.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6HxHI"&gt;That shakeability meant that I was &lt;em&gt;constantly &lt;/em&gt;bouncing the little device to earn a currency called watts. You could gift watts to Pikachu or, oddly, gamble them away at a slot machine. You can learn more about it on this delightful Nintendo Japan website &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/pokepika/"&gt;that’s still around&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kGS5r"&gt;Nintendo released an upgraded model, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khJQyldV6Qs"&gt;the Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/pika_kg/index.html"&gt; in 1999 in Japan&lt;/a&gt; and 2000 in North America and Europe, &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Pikachu_2_GS"&gt;according to Bulbapedia&lt;/a&gt;. It had a color screen and could connect to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Gold&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Silver&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Crystal&lt;/em&gt; via the Game Boy Color’s infrared port, allowing you to trade watts for items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3ATsn4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ab_SK8Bj8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Uas9CW"&gt;A pokémon-themed camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7PPYZH"&gt;Just look at this point-and-shoot camera. It has a giant Pikachu on one side, two poké balls hold the flash and the lens, and an adorable Diglett is the shutter button. The camera shot 35mm film, and each photo would also have a pokémon-themed border, &lt;a href="https://www.manualslib.com/manual/66182/Tiger-Electronics-Pokemon-Camera.html#manual"&gt;according to the manual&lt;/a&gt;. (You can see that border, which featured Pikachu, Meowth, Squirtle, and Blastoise, &lt;a href="https://www.lomography.com/cameras/3341370-pokemon-toy-camera/photos"&gt;in this album&lt;/a&gt;.) A couple eBay listings peg its release date as 1999.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-video-games/hey-you-pikachu/" target="_blank"&gt;The Pokémon Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The box art for&lt;/em&gt; Hey You Pikachu&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0zsM1n"&gt;Hey You, Pikachu’s “Voice Recognition Unit”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4sX4MX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey You, Pikachu &lt;/em&gt;was a Nintendo 64 game that let you talk to Pikachu with the help of the Voice Recognition Unit, or VRU, that was bundled with the game. It was released in &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hey_You,_Pikachu!"&gt;1998 in Japan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hey-you-pikachu"&gt;2000 in North America&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLyHTj"&gt;You can see the VRU in the picture above — users clipped a large microphone to their controller, plugged that into a special module (which stored Pikachu’s 256-word vocabulary, &lt;a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=IKvES_TIwJoC&amp;amp;q=pikachu&amp;amp;pg=PA42#v=snippet&amp;amp;q=pikachu&amp;amp;f=false"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Popular Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and then plugged &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; module into the Nintendo 64 itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfkLYs"&gt;And speaking of Pikachu-themed hardware...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kkCF2Qb2AeagNswlEOFx0lXSJlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22325048/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_9.04.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/n01/n64/hardware/pica64/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo.co.jp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pikachu-themed Nintendo 64s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4RK30v"&gt;The Pikachu-themed Nintendo 64&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UMvH4s"&gt;The Pikachu-themed Nintendo 64, &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nintendo_64#Pok.C3.A9mon_special_editions"&gt;released in 2000&lt;/a&gt;, put a fun twist on the console’s design by making the on-off switch a poké ball and Pikachu’s right foot the reset button. I love how giant Pikachu is — it dominates almost half the console. And while I can’t remember ever actually using one of these myself, I imagine it must have been very satisfying to press Pikachu’s little foot to reset a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x4HQ7U"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/td4PyrDg9R0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rajetJ"&gt;Pokémon mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4CyHmA"&gt;The Pokémon mini was a tiny handheld console designed specifically to play Pokémon-themed games from cartridges. It was released in &lt;a href="https://www.serebii.net/mini/"&gt;2001 in North America and Japan and 2002 in Europe&lt;/a&gt;. It was 74mm x 58mm x 23mm — described on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Corporate/Nintendo-History/Pokemon-mini/Pokemon-mini-627132.html"&gt;still-active Pokémon mini Nintendo UK website&lt;/a&gt; as “well under half the size” of Nintendo’s iconic Game Boy Advance — and came in three colors. It even had motion sensing &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; rumble built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TZwAVp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBZceKkx9Tk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pl5uDu"&gt;Pokéwalker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mzLnYH"&gt;The Pokémon Pikachu devices were succeeded by the poké ball-themed Pokéwalker in 2009, which was bundled with every copy of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon HeartGold&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SoulSilver&lt;/em&gt;. Like the Pokémon Pikachu, the Pokéwalker was a pedometer, let you accumulate watts, and allowed you to take care of pokémon. But unlike the Pokémon Pikachu, you could transfer pokémon back and forth from the Pokéwalker, meaning you weren’t forced to only care for Pikachu. You could also find new wild pokémon and items directly on your Pokéwalker by spending watts to play mini-games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kowUzM"&gt;Nintendo has uploaded the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/Pokewalker_Tri.pdf"&gt;Pokéwalker’s manual online&lt;/a&gt;, if you’d like to learn more about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jn3ZVS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1GrsVmwwPAg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shn1M5"&gt;Poké Ball Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DqBYMd"&gt;Nintendo released another poké ball-themed device in 2018 alongside &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!&lt;/em&gt;: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18091186/poke-ball-plus-review-mew-catch-cute"&gt;Poké Ball Plus&lt;/a&gt;, an actual, functional game controller that’s compatible with the Nintendo Switch. You can play both games with the controller and catch pokémon by making a throwing motion with your arm. Similar to the Pokéwalker, you can also store pokémon inside the Poké Ball Plus, and they’ll even cry from inside it if you shake it around. The controller is also compatible with the huge mobile hit &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZlyPpu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RWM3tIlXTp8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LnvM0o"&gt;This Poké Ball replica that “must never be thrown”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LLP863"&gt;This only barely counts as a gadget, but I had to include it. Last November, The Pokémon Company International and The Wand Company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw"&gt;announced this $99.99 die-cast replica&lt;/a&gt; of the Poké Ball. As realistic as it looks, don’t go throwing it at your cat as a joke; it weighs 10.5oz, which is double the weight of a baseball. And in fact, &lt;a href="https://www.thewandcompany.com/pokeball/"&gt;The Wand Company says&lt;/a&gt; that it “must never be thrown” and that “throwing the Poké Ball will damage it and may injure someone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91K0eh"&gt;But if you’ve ever wanted to actually hold a poké ball, buying one of these might be the closest you can get. It even glows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Pyl-6V-ZmFCcSQHYDVe9o27lo0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67425530/vpavic_4261_20201023_0058.10.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="zvxwjZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 8:03AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Sony’s PlayStation 5 with the disc drive is currently &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;&lt;em&gt;available for purchase at Target&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, while supplies last. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22295875/sony-ps5-playstation-5-restock-target"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaMPZI"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRnEk3"&gt;Ever since Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville &lt;a href="https://time.com/5084599/first-recorded-sound/#:~:text=On%20April%209%2C%201860%2C%20Scott,on%20the%20First%20Sounds%20website.)"&gt;recorded an almost undecipherable version&lt;/a&gt; of the French song “Au Clair de la Lune” in the mid-19th century, it’s been clear that the technology that you use to produce and listen to sounds can affect your experience. Even now, about 150 years later, the quality of your gear can mean the difference between a tinny, nearly unrecognizable noise or a fully realized aural experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGz0GQ"&gt;As you can imagine, the people here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spend a lot of time listening to a variety of digital sounds — whether it’s online meetings, music, podcasts, videos, or sound checks of their own multimedia productions. We asked the staff what their favorite devices were to either listen to, enhance, or produce their digital sounds. Here’s what they talked about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZeeQqi"&gt;Plantronics Explorer 500 Bluetooth headset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ky5Yje"&gt;About six years ago, I reviewed a midlevel Bluetooth headset from Plantronics (now Poly) called the Explorer 500. It was a small, nicely built, single-ear headset, and it came with a short USB cable with ends that magnetically snapped together to become a loop. I thought it was a pretty good piece of tech at the time, so I bought one — and I’m still using it. Of course, it’s not great for music (it uses only one ear, after all), but it’s incredibly convenient to have it hanging on a loop in my bag so I can grab it for a quick phone call or if I want to listen to a podcast. And surprisingly, the battery still holds a reasonable charge. One of these days, I’ll have to invest in a fully wireless headset so I can have fully mobile music as well — but until then, my Explorer 500 serves me well. &lt;em&gt;— Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NoPSWk"&gt;AudioQuest Dragonfly USB DAC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AudioQuest Dragonfly series" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Ui6vwW1WbLQguXaTZRa_fVDN0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323521/dragonfly_family.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2jVzAw"&gt;AudioQuest’s Dragonfly portable digital-to-analog converter (DAC) brings higher-quality audio to your devices. Most laptops, tablets, and smartphones don’t have great DACs or don’t natively support hi-res files like &lt;a href="https://www.soundguys.com/flac-audio-guide-28859/"&gt;FLAC&lt;/a&gt; (nor tell you when they don’t), but with the Dragonfly, you’ll be able to listen to uncompressed audio up to 24-bit / 96kHz. There’s also an LED light on the device that changes colors to indicate which sample rate is being supported at the moment. AudioQuest makes &lt;a href="https://www.audioquest.com/page/aq-dragonfly-series.html"&gt;three separate models&lt;/a&gt;: the basic Dragonfly Black; the Dragonfly Red, which uses a higher-performance DAC chip; and the Dragonfly Cobalt, its highest-end model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSG7H1"&gt;In order to take full advantage of the Dragonfly, you’ll also need an adapter for your phone with a Lightning-to-USB-A adapter for an iPhone or a USB-C-to-USB-A adapter for an Android device. Portability is the biggest feature here — swapping between my phone and my laptop is the reason I’m recommending this for anyone who wants one gadget that will let you listen to hi-res audio on any device. &lt;em&gt;— Andrew Marino, audio engineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aMr9rJ"&gt;Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KHr1K9"&gt;Alright, yes, I’m aware that these are pretty much already the internet’s favorite pair of wired, over-ear headphones. But seriously: I’ve had mine for six years now, and they’ve held up great. Sure, the pleather on the headband is starting to flake off, and I had to replace the ear cups a while back, but they sound just as good as the day I got them. I find that music just sounds fun with them — not too analytical, like my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-770-PRO-Studio-Headphone/dp/B0006NL5SM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DT-770 Pros&lt;/a&gt; can sometimes be. The Audio-Technicas are for sure not reference headphones, but that’s probably not what most people are actually looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B79JbF"&gt;They were also a great price, especially compared to their Bluetooth counterparts. And honestly, I’ve been falling out of love with wireless headphones for anything other than working out, though that’s probably a problem with me, not them. Either way, the newer version, the ATH-M50x (the ATH-M50 has been discontinued), has a removable cable so you don’t have to worry about being saddled with the ridiculously long cables that sometimes come with fancy headphones. (Another version, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/12/18078028/audio-technica-m50xbt-review-wireless-headphones"&gt;ATH-M50xBT&lt;/a&gt;, disposes of the cable entirely.) &lt;em&gt;— Mitchell Clark, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="l1gkhJ"&gt;Antlion Audio ModMic USB microphone &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Antlion Audio ModMic USB microphone  " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eV3rV27GkcW8A3ZOdCkKOewh454=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22323851/antlion2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Antlion Audio ModMic USB microphone  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZ6qXx"&gt;It seems like everyone’s getting big standalone microphones for their desks during the pandemic, but I don’t want to give up any precious real estate. A solution that works better for my needs is Antlion Audio’s ModMic USB microphone. It’s cleverly designed. First, you adhere a small circular base (about the size of a large chocolate chip) to the side of your headphones, then the microphone itself can be magnetically attached and detached at will. I like being able to quickly turn my headphones into a gaming headset, or to get ready for a meeting appearance, then back to regular headphones by detaching the mic. I use one with my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/beyerdynamic-Over-Ear-Studio-Headphones-construction/dp/B0011UB9CQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beyerdynamic DT 990 Pro&lt;/a&gt; open-back headphones and it helps me get more out of the kit I already own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLH3Uz"&gt;This particular microphone has two modes you can switch between: omnidirectional (made for broadcasts) or unidirectional, which helps to capture just your voice if you’re in a noisy environment. The sound quality of a voice recording made with the ModMic is very good — far better than most of the gaming headsets I’ve tried. The microphone is compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, PS4, and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5EswQ"&gt;The downside is this model costs about $70. Also, if your headphones are wired, introducing this mic’s wire into the fray can get a little tough to manage. For me, the price is worth the effort. Antlion also makes &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KQF165L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an all-wireless rechargeable microphone for $120&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to go that route, which also has dual mic modes and can stick to your headphones with adhesive. &lt;em&gt;— Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Xcp41s"&gt;AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xNbBZV"&gt;I love my AirPods and I have since my first pair. They’re lightweight, they charge up quickly in their case, and they sound good enough for what I need them for, which is mostly hearing notifications, listening to podcasts, and watching YouTube videos. It helps that I’m an iPhone and a Mac user, as they work really well with both devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDreCs"&gt;I think I like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;original AirPods&lt;/a&gt; more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Pros&lt;/a&gt;, though. While the Pros offer some welcome upgrades like active noise cancellation and water and sweat resistance, they just don’t fit my ears as well. The original AirPods never fell out, but the AirPods Pro will slowly slip out if I’m talking or eating, and sometimes when I’m running. That means I’m constantly readjusting them if I’m doing anything besides sitting completely still. (To be fair, I’m sitting completely still a lot of the time right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxxsQV"&gt;Here’s hoping that the next version of the Pros will fit my ears just a little bit better. If they do, they’ll likely become one of my favorite Apple products ever. &lt;em&gt;— Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0RKAmN"&gt;This four-mic input audio interface by Rode makes it significantly easier to set up a full podcasting session with a design that mimics a live mixing board. You can record multitracks onto your computer or internally on a microSD using a USB-C connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME2RjE"&gt;As someone who mostly mixes podcasts after they’re recorded, this setup is more appealing to me for live streaming on Twitch or YouTube. You also get built-in customizable sound banks, compression and EQ settings, multiple outputs for monitoring, and an intuitive design for traditional live mixing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubIZX2"&gt;Fun tip: it’s also a great way to record phone call interviews by pairing the RodeCaster Pro with your smartphone via Bluetooth. &lt;em&gt;— Andrew Marino &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2aNoo8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10358134" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qdr5az"&gt;HyperX QuadCast microphone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HyperX Quadcast" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JT5IOP76XL1bGJs8D2zSvTG-mk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324030/hx_product_mic_quadcast_1_zm_lg.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rxwv9X"&gt;I’d been looking to upgrade my microphone for a long time, but I was unsure which product to go with. A few friends recommended the HyperX QuadCast, and that’s what I ended up buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb0Egd"&gt;Previously, I used a Blue Yeti microphone, but I felt the audio quality was unsatisfactory on my end. I wanted to make sure I was buying a microphone that was not too cheap and not too pricey and, most importantly, had a nice cable lengthy so I did not have to rearrange my desk. Compared to the Blue Yeti, I found the HyperX QuadCast had great clarity and picked up the subtle details from my audio output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Errb6j"&gt;I really enjoy the somewhat unconventional design of the QuadCast; it comes with straightforward controls, a stand, and a shock mount adapter for boom arms if you want to mount the microphone closer to you. I also find it convenient that the mute button is on top of the microphone. It makes it easy to mute myself quickly while on Zoom or Discord. &lt;em&gt;—Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xbo5rJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306468" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IQihjM"&gt;Sonos Five speaker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos Five&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GuQSMo"&gt;I’ve never found a single smart speaker that sounds better, and I like that there are no microphones inside. Those are the main bullet points for why I’ve had a Sonos Play:5 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248545/sonos-five-speaker-announced-play-5-price-features-release-date"&gt;recently refreshed as the Sonos Five&lt;/a&gt; — on my desk for several years now. For a speaker that doesn’t have a 360-degree design, the Five still produces a very satisfactory soundstage that can fill most rooms. It can kick out ample bass without overpowering the highs and mids of your music. It takes &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; of most other smart speakers paired together to come anywhere close to what the Sonos Five can deliver. (Granted, it had better sound damn good for $500.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6CZGxU"&gt;Pretty much every audio app under the sun is supported through the Sonos app, including hi-fi options like Tidal and Amazon Music HD. The Sonos Five works with Apple AirPlay, and there’s a 3.5-millimeter aux input for wired playback. (You can also use this to get a turntable hooked into your Sonos system.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha7TqV"&gt;No, there’s no built-in voice assistant like Alexa or Google Assistant included here. But some people will appreciate the absence of always-listening mics. And adding an assistant to the mix after the fact is easy, either via another Sonos speaker like the One or simply by hooking up an Echo Dot or Nest Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeVRCz"&gt;It’s just a shame that the white and black combo Play:5 colorway is no more; I think that was the best-looking speaker Sonos ever made. &lt;em&gt;— Chris Welch, news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nerf reveals Hyper, its next-gen high capacity blasters with the fastest reloads ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oJ-H7o2roGY6SVEIgQMTfNjm0ZE=/0x0:5070x3380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872594/nerf_hyper_mach_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXdJ1v"&gt;Nerf maker Hasbro has heard you loud and clear, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7MDrUG4cws"&gt;Adam Savages of the world&lt;/a&gt;: you want to be able to shoot foam projectiles for days, without carrying around a belt full of magazines or constantly stooping down to reload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fTjok"&gt;Today, the company’s announcing Nerf Hyper, a new line of blasters that not only shoots harder (up to 110 feet per second) than any stock blaster but also features the company’s fastest reloads yet, thanks to a smaller foam projectile that takes up so little space, you can fit 40 of them &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a pistol-sized blaster. That’s unheard of in Nerf. You can clip on (or carry around) 50 or 100 round canisters to quickly top them up, much like a paintball gun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T05ziY7oFDsNHAhNkOx5Psj-LX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326435/NER_HYPER_RUSH40.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hyper Rush-40, with the optional 50-round canister and $20 face mask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OAvqbI"&gt;Hasbro doesn’t have a firm release date for Hyper yet beyond “2021,” but we’re getting three blasters to start: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FlQeXt"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;$30 Nerf Hyper Rush-40&lt;/strong&gt; is the 40-round pistol I mentioned; it’s a single-shot, spring-action where you pull back the entire slide (including its integrated hopper), then fire once.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OTxhCl"&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;$40 Hyper Siege-50&lt;/strong&gt; holds 50 rounds in a pump-action shotgun design that features slam fire too; hold down the trigger and it’ll fire as fast as you pump. See it atop our gallery below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qO0mQ8"&gt;But the flagship is clearly the &lt;strong&gt;$70 Hyper Mach-100&lt;/strong&gt;, a fully automatic SMG design that takes D batteries and spits out foam balls from its 100-round hopper. See it at the top of this post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="NjmLm7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10359889"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pSxqjy"&gt;Note that none of the new blasters actually breaks records for how many shots you get before reloading — the $100 Nerf Rival Nemesis, $100 Perses, and $200 Prometheus already featured hoppers capable of fitting 100 or more of Hasbro’s larger Rival balls. Rival was already capable of 100 feet per second, so 110fps also isn’t a huge jump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ET2OAS"&gt;No, it’s the capacity-to-size ratio of these blasters that’s truly impressive. “In the volume where you could previously house 25 Rival rounds, you can now fit 100 Hyper rounds,” Hasbro SVP and Nerf brand manager Tom Warner tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5tZLV"&gt;Where the fan-favorite Perses just &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; fit 100 into a big, beefy SMG unless you invested &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSJlki3kLc"&gt;in an aftermarket hopper&lt;/a&gt;, it might be easier now. The next time Nerf makes a big underslung cannon like the Prometheus, you might theoretically be able to fire 800 rounds without reloading once. And it wasn’t too long ago a six-shot revolver was considered the state of the art in stock Nerf sidearms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBKEQXgIGb2J8xC4AzQWxuDzfh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326454/hyper_refill_canisters.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hasbro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jZw6Ox"&gt;And while you might wind up spending on new ammo, you could pay a lot less per shot if you buy in bulk. While the 50- and 100-round refill canisters will retail for $12 and $20 respectively, you’ll be able to pick up a pack of 200 rounds for under $30. That works out to  15 cents per projectile — far less than the 27 cents Nerf charges per Elite dart, not to mention the 36 cents per Rival, 40 cents per Ultra, or 50 cents for each Mega dart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0P0Vfs"&gt;Hasbro tells us that while it needed to find a new material for Hyper balls, they should actually fly further now, while still being able to bounce. No word on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249059/nerf-rival-curve-shot-wanted-blaster"&gt;whether they’ll curve&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8vIus"&gt;It’s been over five years since the Nerf community showed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFfwXsr48kM"&gt;that Rival was perfect for high-capacity, rapid-fire blasters&lt;/a&gt;, and the Nemesis and Perses were an excellent start, but Hasbro also recently got &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdXeLAvkqJM"&gt;trounced when it comes to long-range blasters&lt;/a&gt; while still trying to sell us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20880209/nerf-ultra-one-blaster-foam-darts-120-feet-incompatible-ammo-drm-date-price"&gt;on its proprietary Ultra dart&lt;/a&gt;. But Hyper looks like it could do a lot of the things Nerfers want all at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NsrJxP"&gt;I’m very eager to see where Hyper will fit in the new foam blaster meta once the pandemic recedes, and whether the community will embrace it or not. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PS5 is again in stock at Target</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qjYK1YbradBIK9xc3xXHS-Qfus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872522/vpavic_4278_20201030_0120.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fsXn2"&gt;The PlayStation 5 is Sony’s latest gaming console and just like Microsoft’s Xbox Series X / S it’s in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;high demand&lt;/a&gt; and limited supply. If you are looking to buy a PS5, you have a shot at securing the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$500 model with a disc drive right now at Target&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eISLkt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvrjQu"&gt;After you secure your PS5 (or if already own one), you should consider picking up a few items that will help you get the most out of your next-gen console. One such accessory is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DualSense-Wireless-Controller-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC6C75Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt; in the event one controller’s battery dies and you want to keep playing but prefer not to be tethered by the charging cable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="htPXDI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aRXDxL"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt; is also good to pick up if you have yet to renew your membership or are new to the service. There are a few benefits to having an active subscription to Sony’s online gaming service. Most notably, PS5 users have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining” games released on the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam’s multiplayer game streaming now works with friends without Steam accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uAIpf_z8wNysAXKEH0SkCdzeSe4=/0x0:789x526/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872500/remote_play_together.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCq1pd"&gt;Steam’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20924545/steam-remote-play-together-beta-valve-online-co-op-local-multiplayer"&gt;Remote Play Together feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you stream local multiplayer games with friends over the internet, will no longer require every player to have a Steam account. The new functionality, which is &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/homestream/discussions/0/3111395750231979202/"&gt;currently in beta&lt;/a&gt;, lets Steam users invite a friend to their game with a link, after which they’ll be prompted to install the Steam Link app if they don’t have it already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S53UFZ"&gt;There are limits to the new feature. Games will need to already support the Remote Play Together feature for it to work (there are filtering options to find these titles), and only one friend without a Steam account can join a multiplayer session. If you want to add more, they’ll need to have accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQWn04"&gt;To try the feature out, head to your friends list in the Steam overlay while playing a Remote Play Together-compatible title and click the “Copy Link” button. Steam says you’re able to send links to friends to play on Windows, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20975039/steam-remote-play-together-ios-android-devices-beta-chat-link-app-windows-macos-linux"&gt;Android, iOS&lt;/a&gt;, or even Raspberry Pi devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom adding automatic closed captioning for all free accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ld7v05UtCLwutEDCVGG7r6RuixI=/175x0:1294x746/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872362/Jen_Hill_Accessibility.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom has previously supported AI-generated closed captions for paid accounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7sB3oM"&gt;Zoom plans to roll out support for automatic closed captioning to free accounts this fall as part of its efforts to make the service more accessible, the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/update-on-live-transcription-for-free-accounts/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a free account holder who needs access to the feature before then, Zoom is allowing users to manually request access to the Live Transcription feature via a Google Form linked to in &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/update-on-live-transcription-for-free-accounts/"&gt;its announcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8liC9"&gt;Automatic transcriptions aren’t an entirely new Zoom feature. The service has previously offered AI-powered live transcription for all its paid accounts. Otherwise, meeting hosts have had to manually add their own captions, or use a third-party service. But now the feature will become available to the millions of people that rely on Zoom’s services for free. A &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/207279736-Closed-captioning-and-live-transcription"&gt;Zoom support page&lt;/a&gt; notes that its Live Transcription feature is currently only available in English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGkTRm"&gt;Automatic closed captions are also available with other video conferencing services &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/9300310?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;like Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;. Given how widely used Zoom has become since the start of the pandemic, however, it’s great to see it adding more accessibility features. Previous efforts to make Zoom more accessible have included allowing meetings to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452400/zoom-accessibility-features-pin-spotlight-multiple-videos-during-call"&gt;pin and spotlight interpreters on a call&lt;/a&gt;, as well as adding screen reader support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QincC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google TV will include a new ‘Basic’ mode to make your smart TV, dumb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2CfT0j0IieqRz025OECpSsgGx7w=/0x0:1423x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872240/google_tv_basic_mode.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The basic TV option reportedly appears at setup. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/" target="_blank"&gt;Google / 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iG3HrV"&gt;Google TV, the search giant’s latest attempt at TV software, will include a new “Basic TV” mode that strips out a TV’s smart features in favor of providing simple access to live TV and HDMI inputs, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a potential boon to anyone that ever wanted to dumb-down their smart TV because they prefer an external streamer or because they value privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V4jmCU"&gt;Google TV debuted on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;the new Chromecast&lt;/a&gt;, where it offered a new interface built on Google’s existing Android TV software, but will soon be offered as built-in software for &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/11/tcl-google-tv-2021/"&gt;TCL&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;Sony’s&lt;/a&gt; upcoming TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woVj7j"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you can select the “Basic TV” mode at setup. Doing so strips out the operating system’s apps, content recommendations, and Google Assistant support. It’s possible to revert back to the standard interface at any time, but selecting the basic mode can only be done on setup. Unfortunately it’s unclear exactly what the interface will end up looking like, since the developer-focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004376/google-adt-3-android-tv-10-update-set-top-hdmi-2-1"&gt;ADT-3 dongle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; tested the mode on doesn’t have the required live TV or HDMI hardware. We also don’t know how basic mode will affect data collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OU_exYd-Lzk6bfj4NbGuxl15V-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327792/google_tv_basic_mode_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-tv-basic-tv-mode/" target="_blank"&gt;Google / 9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interface shows which features the basic TV mode strips out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zEk7gn"&gt;A Google spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;that the mode is a feature of Google TV specifically, rather than Android TV 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tTXi7"&gt;There are plenty of reasons that people might want to remove all the smarts from a smart TV. Many users rely on set-top boxes from Apple, Roku, or Amazon for their streaming content, and a duplicate interface built into their TV just gets in the way. Others might want to continue using a TV long after developers have stopped supporting its software and apps, at which point it’s helpful to be able to strip it down to its bare essentials to improve performance. Or maybe you just don’t like the idea of using a smart TV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/7/14527360/vizio-smart-tv-tracking-settlement-disable-settings"&gt;given their history of tracking you everything you watch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overcast overhauls its Apple Watch app</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXtyWAMsl4ChX8JMzdaDOXkvstQ=/0x0:4032x2688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68872032/IMG_1337_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kXVs25"&gt;A new update to popular podcast player &lt;a href="https://overcast.fm"&gt;Overcast&lt;/a&gt; includes a major overhaul of its Apple Watch app. The Apple Watch support is notable at a time when third-party app development for the platform is not necessarily in a great spot, though the Watch itself continues to grow in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EWM1X"&gt;Overcast’s update reorganizes the app UI from top to bottom, adding some features that otherwise were only able to be accessed through the phone version. The main screen has large buttons for settings and syncing above a scrolling list of your shows and access to the “now playing” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoXK26"&gt;That screen now includes a button on the bottom right that takes you to more detailed info on the podcast and lets you adjust its playback speed, as well as giving you the ability to skip directly through chapters on podcasts that have them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ArC1lb"&gt;Release notes for the new iOS version of Overcast, which is dubbed 2021.1, note a couple of extra changes without going into details. Other than the new Watch app, Overcast now has “improved Siri support” and “tons of under-the-hood improvements and bug fixes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddXyoR"&gt;Overcast is &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/overcast-podcast-player/id888422857"&gt;available for the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, and now M1-powered Macs because of their support for running iOS apps. The app is free but ad-supported, with an optional $9.99 subscription that can remove the ads.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG: New State is a futuristic new battle royale game for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FG35rvlSegFMS6_TcQniVYhW-0w=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68871803/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Key_Art_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t2yXxQ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe is expanding with a new mobile title for iOS and Android called &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State, &lt;/em&gt;which catapults the battle royale ahead in time for a more futuristic take on the massive multiplayer genre. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRcioC"&gt;Set in 2051, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; takes place years after the current &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games (which are set in approximately modern times) on a new map called Troi and promises to bring with it a slew of near-future weapons and vehicles, like drones and deployable combat shields. Based on the early images, it’s a similar vibe to fellow shooter &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;’s semi-futuristic military tech from games like &lt;em&gt;Black Ops 3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJD19c"&gt;The new game is also set to dive deeper into the &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;lore of the overall &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; universe&lt;/a&gt;, which is apparently a thing that surprisingly exists for a game whose most notable cultural signifier is the use of a cast-iron skillet as a weapon. What the time jump will mean for beloved &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; characters like &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/en/character/lunchmeat"&gt;Lunchmeat&lt;/a&gt;, though, will have to wait for the game’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVi79IthSp1c0u7cD0MoZHZZuoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326840/PUBG_NEW_STATE_Screenshot_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kSJ0pM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; also promises to shake up the formula for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; games, with in-game weapon customization options that will allow players to modify their weapons within a match in a way that sounds similar to &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ weapon attachments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCeBU6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New State&lt;/em&gt; marks the third battle royale game under the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; umbrella — although, unlike its mobile cousin &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State&lt;/em&gt; will be developed by PUBG Studio, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, the PC and console version of the original game. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21399585/pubg-mobile-update-esports-tournament-2-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; is actually a separate title&lt;/a&gt; developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.) And despite the mobile nature of the title, PUBG Studio is making big promises of “ultra-realistic graphics that push the limits of mobile gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKBKW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG: New State &lt;/em&gt;will be available on Android and iOS later in 2021, with alpha tests also set for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
