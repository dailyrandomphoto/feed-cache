    <title>Sony Alpha ZV-E10 review: interchangeable lens vlogging machine</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Warning: will likely lead to expensive lens purchases&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g4iqqo"&gt;The Alpha ZV-E10 is Sony’s newest addition to its lineup of mirrorless cameras. At $799.99 with Sony’s 16-50 lens ($699.99 for just the body), it is the company’s second attempt at making a vlogging-oriented camera and the successor to last year’s&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt; ZV-1&lt;/a&gt;. It adds a headphone jack, more battery life, a larger sensor, and most importantly, an interchangeable lens design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7VHhX"&gt;You can think of it as a video-centric version of Sony’s more photography-oriented &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20836658/sony-a6600-a6100-camera-aps-c-mirrorless-price-specs-features"&gt;A6100&lt;/a&gt;. The A6100 and the ZV-E10 share the same 24mp APS-C sensor, but the lack of a viewfinder and the addition of a fully articulating screen makes the ZV-E10 better suited for filming yourself. And with the new flexibility of being able to swap lenses, this camera is a welcomed upgrade to the ZV-1 that allows novices to dip their toes in more advanced systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gblzVX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10791929"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5x1yw"&gt;With the ZV-1, Sony recycled parts from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;RX100&lt;/a&gt; line to better fit vloggers. This included a fully articulating screen, a larger handgrip, tally lights, a new mic array, and a hot shoe for accessories. The ZV-E10 follows a similar path, but this time, it borrows parts from the Alpha line and remixes them for vlogging use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7579v"&gt;The most important thing with the ZV-E10 is that Sony brought the E-mount lens system to this lineup. A detachable lens system not only allows for much more flexibility in image quality and focal length but also gets a whole community of prosumers buying more accessories. The bad news is the ZV-line 24-megapixel APS-C sensor has a 1.5x crop factor when using full-frame lenses, which means that a 24mm full frame lens will provide a 36mm equivalent field of view on this camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hP8zpS1XFTtjgF-QWf_YJ-x50U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890183/bfarsace_290921_4781_01963.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A6600 and the ZV-E10 share the same 24-megapixel APS-C sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f3FjIO"&gt;The next welcomed upgrades over the ZV-1 are a USB-C port and a larger battery. Every piece of tech I use, outside of my five-year-old bike lights, now uses a USB-C cable, and goddamnit, that feels good. The larger battery is a much-needed improvement, but I was still needing two batteries to get through a day of casual filming. The E10’s NP-FW50 batteries are a hand-me-down from Sony’s older Alpha cameras that we often cited as a point of weakness in those systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4YuVs"&gt;On the left side of the camera, two plastic doors hide the USB-C port, a Micro HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a mic port (two features that are rare to see at this price point), while the battery compartment holds the SD card slot. Up top is a new physical switch for power along with a mode switching button, a record button, and a background defocus button. And while Sony kept the zoom toggle for use with the detachable power zoom 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens, it also added a top dial for aperture or shutter speed adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MqEq7T_Dxl95qWTegh0-0ISuNz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890187/bfarsace_290921_4781_01975.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZV-E10 has a USB-C port for charging and data transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hkV6RvSyJI0J0j_NnFS5qzplz6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890185/bfarsace_290921_4781_01971.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power switch has a great click.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-VBzzddx9Nm-lP1egggaxXCNe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890184/bfarsace_290921_4781_01967.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the controls on the back of the camera are on the right side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox70MK"&gt;Much like the ZV-1, the ZV-E10 does not have an electronic viewfinder (EVF), and although the three-inch articulating screen is plenty bright, even in direct sunlight, using an EVF feels far more immersive when taking both photos and videos for me. However, in a vlogging-first camera, I can understand why an EVF would be first on the list of features to cut. This camera is designed to be able to film oneself, first and foremost, with ease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmLYwg"&gt;There is also no built-in ND filter. Built-in ND filters are one of the few features of cinema cameras that I continually miss when using DSLR and mirrorless systems. There is nothing convenient about having to screw and unscrew pieces of glass onto lenses when filming on location, and it’s infuriating that the ZV-E10’s predecessor, the ZV-1, had this feature, but this camera does not. The upside is that the E10 has an interchangeable E-mount lens system, and I already own ND filters for all of my E-mount lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PlX46"&gt;The other drawback to this camera’s hardware is the lack of in-body optical stabilization. Instead, the ZV-E10 uses electronic stabilization that isn’t very effective in steadying handheld footage. A gimbal will be needed to get smooth shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a2keGa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10791270"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="0yaxZf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken on the ZV-E10 with the 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6 lens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="oLdG5b"&gt;The ZV-E10 can take 24.2-megapixel photos, and when paired with the 16-50mm kit lens, the photos are crisp in good light. However, in lower light, and especially when pushed past 8000ISO (admittedly, that’s very high), photos take on a lot of grain and smoothing. This is the same sensor that Sony has been using in its A6000 lineup for a long time, and while it’s good for a quick capture, a faster, more expensive lens will be needed for low-light situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWMEx2"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="ZV-e10 Sample Footage|104229" data-volume-uuid="b30b2e4ad" data-volume-id="104229" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-224" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="PkM0AS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;All sample footage was filmed with the Sony 16-50mm f/3.5-5.6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="AiuHxG"&gt;There was only one way to test this vlogging camera: make a vlog. I took this camera out for a day in Brooklyn to put its in-camera stabilization, defocus mode, and mic to the test. Tune in to my video above for video samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UviRBH"&gt;The ZV-E10 can record at up to 4k 30fps, with a crop, or 4k 24fps, without a crop. I was most eager to test the SteadyShot electronic stabilization. And since I was using the 16-50mm kit lens, I also had the more effective, “active” stabilization that uses optical stabilization built into the lens but, unfortunately, crops more of the image. While the video is certainly smoother at these levels of stabilization, there is a bit of a jitter that is most apparent in fine details, such as tree leaves or bricks. Tune into 01:16 for side-by-side comparisons of SteadyShot Standard, which uses the electronic stabilization, and SteadyShot Active, which uses both the electronic stabilization and in-lens optical stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GO-y8fquVW_V3kxN9sYyaOXWj6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890189/bfarsace_290921_4781_01994.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fully articulating 3” screen is bright, even in direct sunlight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sXjOpj"&gt;Overall, the video quality at 4k 24fps is punchy, crisp, and offers a lot of control over depth of field to justify using it over a phone. But in low light, the kit lens struggles. And once you push the camera past 6400ISO, the image begins to fill with grain. I had to shoot most of the latter half of this vlog at 10000ISO, which made the autofocus hunt, the image underexposed, and overall presented a very pixelated video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTwLqa"&gt;I was disappointed with the mic quality and background defocus button as well. Unsurprisingly, the mic does very well when speaking from behind the camera, where my mouth was much closer to the pickup unit, but from in front of the camera, the audio quality was far less impressive. Although it is unlikely that audio from the built-in mics would sound as good as it would with an on-board shotgun mic, like my $60 Rode VideoMicro that I typically vlog with, my voice still sounds farther away and more processed than expected. And although the background defocus mode’s trick of opening up the lens aperture as much as possible to get the shallowest depth of field is great for beginners, I don’t think it’s valuable enough to devote a whole button to. Fortunately, you can change that: I programmed this button to toggle focus modes instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vsbaDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10785074"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rBZgsq"&gt;The freedom to swap lenses on a camera can be a scary dive into unknown, expensive territory, but it also gives this camera more flexibility over time. A new or different lens is an easy way to add value to any camera system. And while a good lens can ultimately be burdened by the sensor it is projecting light onto, it both holds value over time and can be used with newer cameras in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Fvmtko"&gt;For a vlogger looking to take the next step in image quality and creative control over what a phone can provide, the ZV-E10 is easy to use and beginner-friendly while providing easy ways to step up your game. Its low light capabilities could be better, but its $800 price tag makes it a great camera to learn from without taking the full leap into more expensive, harder-to-use systems. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch confirms major data breach after its source code and secrets leak out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GgCPMfDsO5jY4HkWDXhKPQvGDn8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959447/acastro_190923_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eay5cx"&gt;Twitch has confirmed that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;has suffered a major data breach&lt;/a&gt;. “We can confirm a breach has taken place,” says a Twitch spokesperson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this. We will update the community as soon as additional information is available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvVjBa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;Hackers have so far leaked data&lt;/a&gt; that includes source code for the company’s streaming service, an unreleased Steam competitor from Amazon Game Studios, and details of creator payouts. An anonymous poster on the 4chan messaging board released a 125GB torrent earlier today, which they claim includes the entirety of Twitch and its commit history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="m0Lv5R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We can confirm a breach has taken place. Our teams are working with urgency to understand the extent of this. We will update the community as soon as additional information is available. Thank you for bearing with us.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1445770441176469512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4BfU3a"&gt;The leak has been labeled as “part one,” suggesting that there could be more to come. While personal information like creator payments is included, this initial leak doesn’t appear to include passwords, addresses, or email accounts of Twitch users. Instead, the leaker appears to have focused on sharing Twitch’s own company tools and information, rather than code that would include personal accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty57ya"&gt;It’s not clear how much data has been accessed, though. Twitch says it’s working to understand its security breach, and it appears that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/q2h36a/lol_how_fitting/"&gt;some users&lt;/a&gt; are being asked to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MasterEchu/status/1445772592376258568"&gt;change their passwords&lt;/a&gt;. Until we understand the extent of this breach, we’d recommend changing your Twitch password and enabling two-factor authentication if you haven’t already done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYS7gv"&gt;The Twitch leak will be damaging for the game streaming service either way and particularly for creators who rely on Twitch to keep their earnings and information secure. The hack follows weeks of protest for Twitch to improve its service under the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620874/twitch-implements-improved-chat-filters"&gt;#DoBetterTwitch movement&lt;/a&gt;. Twitch streamers also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650578/twitch-streamers-walkout-protest-hate-raids"&gt;took a day off in August&lt;/a&gt; to protest against the company’s lack of action against hate raids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XunPVb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:32AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with information on password resets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s good, bad, and missing in the Facebook whistleblower’s testimony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kj8cgxiYLLFMxQBhRE0HFx6GMHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959302/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cbcyx6"&gt;Today let’s talk about Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony before the Senate: the good, the bad, and what ought to happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18vEo1"&gt;For more than three hours on Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen#lawmakers-have-come-a-long-way-from-asking-questions-about-how-facebook-makes-money"&gt;Haugen addressed a subset of the Senate Commerce Committee&lt;/a&gt;. She appeared calm, confident, and in control as she read &lt;a href="https://www.franceshaugen.com/blog/b9xlswihkike7639nn4ie23odz9eqy"&gt;her opening remarks&lt;/a&gt; and fielded questions from both parties. While she brought more nuance to her critique than most Facebook critics — she supports Section 230, for example, and opposes a breakup of the company — she also said the company should declare “moral bankruptcy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="heGy18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“becoming an almost trillion-dollar company by buying its profits with our safety”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6jrzSH"&gt;“This is not simply a matter of certain social media users being angry or unstable, or about one side being radicalized against the other,” Haugen told Congress. “It is Facebook choosing to grow at all costs, becoming an almost trillion-dollar company by buying its profits with our safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5JnGe"&gt;The Senate largely ate it up. Long frustrated by Facebook’s size and power — and, one suspects, by its own inability to address those issues in any constructive way — senators yielded the floor to Haugen to make her case. During the hearing titled “Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower,” Haugen walked senators through most of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, touching on ethnic violence, national security, polarization, and more during her testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFis8V"&gt;For their part, senators sought to paint the hearing in historic terms. There were &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/05/facebook-senate-hearing-frances-haugen/#link-OCJ4TMDCIFF3ZGLMWN4VEZ6F6M"&gt;repeated comparisons to Big Tobacco&lt;/a&gt;, and a “Big Tobacco moment.” “This research is the definition of a bombshell,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), who led the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMo39K"&gt;Over at Facebook, the strategic response team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;lobbed a half-hearted smear at Haugen&lt;/a&gt;, noting bizarrely that while at the company, she “had no direct reports” and “never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives.” If there’s a point in there, I missed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxwktM"&gt;Ultimately, Haugen said little on Tuesday that wasn’t previously known, either because she said it on &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt; or it was previously covered in the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FejiZk"&gt;What she might have done, though, is finally galvanize support in Congress for meaningful tech regulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jQKg4"&gt;Let’s walk through Haugen’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PFtRSM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The good parts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Albbzw"&gt;One, Haugen identified real harms that are taking place on Facebook services. For example, she talked about documents which indicate that using Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/10/05/technology/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen/in-hearing-haugen-discusses-how-instagram-may-lead-teenagers-to-eating-disorders"&gt;can contribute to eating disorders in some teenagers&lt;/a&gt;. Too often, discussions about the harms of social networks is either abstract or emotional. The primary benefit of Haugen’s leaking is to bring some empirical rigor to those discussions — and to highlight the degree to which these issues are known, but not discussed, by Facebook executives. That’s powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKFJJm"&gt;In response, Facebook’s Monika Bickert &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1445474828329181188"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that the same research shows that the majority of teenagers find that Instagram improves their well-being. But one of the hearing’s most powerful moments came when Haugen noted that only about 10 percent of cigarette smokers ever get cancer. “So the idea that 20 percent of your users could be facing serious mental health issues, and that’s not a problem, is shocking,” she said, citing leaked data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyEC7K"&gt;Two, Haugen highlighted the value of research in understanding problems and crafting solutions. For years now, we’ve watched Congress interrogate Facebook based on spurious anecdotes about who was censored or shadow banned, or what publisher was or wasn’t included on a list of trending topics, to no constructive end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="02oVDS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The problems here are about the design of algorithms — of AI.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Go69Vx"&gt;It was refreshing, then, to see members of Congress wrestling with the company’s own internal data. Sen. Ted Cruz, rarely seen operating in good faith on any subject, largely set aside his questions about censorship to ask Haugen about data exploring the link between Instagram and self-harm. Facebook will say, not unfairly, that senators were largely just cherry-picking with these questions. But we have to ground these discussions in something — why &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Facebook’s own research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPG2rX"&gt;Third, and maybe most potently, Haugen helped to shift the discussion of platform problems away from the contents of the speech they host and toward the design of the systems themselves. “The problems here are about the design of algorithms — of AI,” Haugen said, in response to a question about whether the company should be broken up. That wouldn’t solve anything, she said — the same engagement-based algorithms would likely create similar issues within the new baby Facebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHUgkl"&gt;Haugen posited regulation of algorithms — specifically, banning engagement-based ranking like Facebook and Instagram use today — as a way to avoid the First Amendment issues that come with attempting to regulate internet speech. As the scholar Daphne Keller has written, attempting to regulate speech algorithms &lt;a href="http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/blog/2021/02/one-law-six-hurdles-congresss-first-attempt-regulate-speech-amplification-padaa"&gt;will likely trigger First Amendment scrutiny anyway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crde5C"&gt;Still, Congress seemed receptive to the idea that it ought to focus on broader system incentives, rather than stunts like the recent efforts in Florida and Texas to force platforms to carry all speech regardless of content. The details get tricky, but that shift would be a welcome one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J5zERo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trouble spots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk9Uyi"&gt;For all its positive aspects, Haugen’s testimony had some unfortunate aspects as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21kiKb"&gt;One, Haugen came across as a solutionist: someone who believes that any problem created by tech can therefore also be solved by tech. This comes across most strongly in her advocacy for a reverse-chronological feed, which she argues would remove incentives to share polarizing or harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H9Epdn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fox News viewership tends to shift people’s political opinions more than Facebook usage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aX7slS"&gt;It seems possible that this is true but only marginally. Polarizing and harmful content was often shared on Twitter and Instagram during the many years that those services used reverse-chronological feeds. That’s not to say reducing algorithmic amplification is a bad idea, or that Facebook shouldn’t research the issue further and share what it finds. But given the broad range of harms identified in the Facebook Files, I found it surprising that Haugen’s pet issue is feed ranking: I just don’t believe it’s as powerful others seem to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU9hsI"&gt;My second, somewhat related concern is that Haugen’s testimony had tunnel vision. Those of us who opine about social networks are forever at risk of attempting to solve society-level problems at the level of the feed. To avoid that, we have to bring other subjects into the conversation. Subjects like how the US was growing polarized long before the arrival of social networks. Or the research showing that long-term Fox News viewership tends to shift people’s political opinions more than Facebook usage. Or the other reasons teenagers may face a growing mental health crisis, from growing inequality and housing insecurity to the threat of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNAsyH"&gt;It’s possible to consider a subject from so many angles that you find yourself paralyzed. But it’s equally paralyzing to begin your effort to rein in Big Tech with the assumption that if you can only “fix” Facebook, you’ll fix society as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evSDtE"&gt;Finally, Haugen’s testimony focused on the documents, rather than her own work at Facebook. I can’t have been alone in wanting to hear more about her time on the Civic Integrity team or later working in counterespionage. But senators were more interested in the admittedly fascinating questions raised by the research that she leaked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S97S1U"&gt;That’s understandable, but it also meant that Haugen had to regularly remind the subcommittee that they were asking her questions in which she did not have expertise. In my own talks with current Facebook employees, this is the point on which I hear the most exasperation: just because you found some documents on a server, they tell me, doesn’t mean you are qualified to describe the underlying research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyqZbZ"&gt;There’s an obvious fix for that — summon more qualified employees to testify! But in the meantime, I wish Haugen had taken more opportunity to discuss what she saw and learned with her own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xHjsmQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should happen next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8Z4v35"&gt;Platforms should take the events of the past few weeks as a cue to begin devising ways to regularly share internal research on subjects in the public interest, annotated with relevant context and with data made available to third-party researchers in a privacy-protecting way. Facebook regularly tells us that most of its research shows that people like it, and the company’s market dominance suggests there is probably evidence to back it up, too. The company should show its hand, if only because soon enough governments will require it to anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="34oitV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Haugen appears to have persuaded Congress that Facebook is as bad as they feared&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZChSmL"&gt;Congress should pass a law requiring large platforms to make data available to outside researchers for the study of subjects in the public interest. (Nate Persily &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/10/05/facebook-research-data-haugen-congress-regulation/"&gt;argues here that the FTC could oversee such a design&lt;/a&gt;.) I think sharing more research is in Facebook’s long-term self-interest and that the company ought to do so voluntarily. But to get an ecosystem-level view, we need more platforms to participate. Unless we want to rely on whistleblowers and random caches of leaked documents to understand the effects of social networks on society, we should require platforms to make more data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rumBsN"&gt;What Congress should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do is pass a sweeping law intended to solve every problem hinted at in Haugen’s testimony in one fell swoop. Doing so would almost certainly curtail free expression dramatically, in ways that would likely benefit incumbent politicians at the expense of challengers and marginalized people. Too many of the bills introduced on these subjects this year fail to take that into account. (Unless they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; taking it into account, and quashing dissent is their ulterior motive.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goZ0nM"&gt;Instead, I’d like to see Congress do a better job of naming the actual problem it’s trying to solve. Listening to the hearing, you heard a lot of possibilities: &lt;em&gt;Facebook is too big&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook is too polarizing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook doesn’t spend enough on safety&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Facebook is a national security risk&lt;/em&gt;. There still appears to be no consensus on how to prioritize any of that, and it’s fair to wonder whether that’s one reason Congress has had so much trouble advancing any legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21xgVB"&gt;In the meantime, right or wrong, Haugen appears to have persuaded Congress that Facebook is as bad as they feared, and that the company’s own research proves it. Simplistic though it may be, that narrative — &lt;em&gt;Facebook is bad, a whistleblower proved it&lt;/em&gt; — is quickly hardening into concrete on Capitol Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1FmAf"&gt;The question, as ever, is whether our decaying Congress will muster the will to do anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A major Hollywood union threatens to strike over streaming pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="los angeles iatse union film strike" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/impGMkSadC79LVUzd-62JlfoLOE=/0x0:6265x4177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959225/1235538501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9vpnXL"&gt;Members of a union representing tens of thousands of television and film production workers announced this week that its members voted overwhelmingly to authorize a nationwide strike over stalled negotiations on several new contracts. A strike could severely disrupt production across Hollywood — but only if the union determines its discussions for improved pay on streaming productions and better working conditions aren’t moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaIvIw"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) announced Monday that 90 percent of its roughly 60,000 members participated in the vote, with 98 percent of those casting their ballots in favor of a strike authorization. What that meant isn’t that a strike was necessarily imminent, but that members authorized IATSE international president Matthew Loeb to call a strike should negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) — which represents major studios — continue to be stalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mKq7su"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The ball is in their court. If they want to avoid a strike, they will return to the bargaining table and make us a reasonable offer.“&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="41bPOZ"&gt;“I hope that the studios will see and understand the resolve of our members,” Loeb said in a statement on Monday. “The ball is in their court. If they want to avoid a strike, they will return to the bargaining table and make us a reasonable offer.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhThzW"&gt;After IATSE made the &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/by-a-nearly-unanimous-margin-iatse-members-in-tv-and-film-production-vote-to-authorize-a-nationwide-strike/"&gt;results of the vote&lt;/a&gt; public on Monday, negotiations between the two parties resumed Tuesday, an AMPTP spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piufke"&gt;The authorization vote doesn’t necessarily mean that IATSE &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; strike, but should it happen, the ramifications would be felt industrywide. &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/what-film-tv-projects-would-and-wouldnt-be-impacted-by-an-iatse-strike-1235022019/"&gt;noted this week&lt;/a&gt; that one of the contracts being negotiated would impact production for major studios like Warner Bros. and MGM and most major streaming services, including Netflix, Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGrxYM"&gt;IATSE members include people involved with every major behind-the-scenes part of productions, from makeup artists to animators to broadcast technicians. So important is IATSE to the movie- and TV-making industries that the strike authorization has been &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/09/hollywood-talents-offer-support-iatse-strike-1234666791/"&gt;backed with support&lt;/a&gt; from major Hollywood A-listers, including &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CUGhF7CPycn/"&gt;Lily Tomlin&lt;/a&gt;, Jane Fonda, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1440682976849719310"&gt;Seth Rogan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RedHourBen/status/1440664178029580300"&gt;Ben Stiller&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="xUZMxD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our films and movies literally would not exist without our crews, and our crews deserve better. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hFMCmWzUVT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hFMCmWzUVT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Seth Rogen (@Sethrogen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/1440682976849719310?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utH3Ma"&gt;IATSE has been negotiating multiple successor contracts, and the union said Monday that the AMPTP had failed to make a counteroffer to its latest proposal. The workplace issues the IATSE is demanding be addressed include unsatisfactory wages for its lowest-paid members, excessive hours it deems unsafe, and a lack of adequate rest and meal breaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMypgB"&gt;Another sticking point has been “new media” — or streaming productions — which receive “greater flexibility” on pay and benefits under the existing contract based on the idea that they may have to pay less to get the growing industry off the ground, according to IATSE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Streaming looks far different today than when that agreement was made in 2009, and the union now says some streaming services are paying its members less than they should be making, “even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters.” IATSE is negotiating “appropriate adjustments” to new media production payouts given how the space has evolved, Loeb said in an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-09-30/iatse-matt-loeb-strike-authorization-vote-hollywood-labor-amptp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pyjD3"&gt;“Our members are working on productions where [producers are] spending inordinate amounts of money and [members are] taking pay hits. They’re working on productions with extremely high production value,” Loeb told the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;. Loeb additionally told the paper last week that the likelihood of a strike “depends largely on the employers and what they’re prepared to do to avoid it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZLwIK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMPTP is “committed to working with them to avoid shutting down the industry at such a pivotal time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSTe0D"&gt;The AMPTP said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it “remains committed to reaching an agreement that will keep the industry working.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwKh7s"&gt;“We deeply value our IATSE crew members and are committed to working with them to avoid shutting down the industry at such a pivotal time, particularly since the industry is still recovering from the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the AMPTP said. “A deal can be made at the bargaining table, but it will require both parties working together in good faith with a willingness to compromise and to explore new solutions to resolve the open issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lqhjaw"&gt;Even still, negotiations have been &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/iatse-strike-vote-result-1235079382/"&gt;ongoing for months&lt;/a&gt;, and the fact that the union has voted near-unanimously to authorize a nationwide strike at all — the first time this has occurred in IATSE’s 128-year history — should send a pretty clear message to studios that the unions members are prepared to take unprecedented measures. And if their return to the bargaining table this week is any indication, studios heard union members loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Mini and 13 Pro Max battery life: better, and a beast</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bN9JrrWVoGrb85ECDRZSMH3Ehw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959185/vpavic_211004_4792_0005_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnSuEM"&gt;I wanted to spend more time with both the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt; before I weighed in with a final verdict on their respective batteries. I’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;updated my full reviews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;of each&lt;/a&gt; to reflect my impressions after using them for a couple weeks, but I figured it might be helpful to lay out what I’m seeing separately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TRy85"&gt;The long and the short of it is that, in both cases, the batteries exceeded my expectations. Apple really did improve on the feature that matters most to most people: these phones last longer than their predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySnwSW"&gt;It’s easy to talk about the battery life on the iPhone 13 Pro Max. It’s ridiculous. It goes and goes, lasting so long that I had to actively work to kill the thing in less than a full day by just shooting a bunch of 4K video to drain it. I think the majority of people will be able to get well into their second day of use before the battery warnings pop up. And I’m talking devil-may-care use, doing whatever you want without concern kind of use. It is, as the headline implies, a battery beast.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dadgdYndc2z3NCqOCsESrVqQwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863261/akrales_210917_4760_0331.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro Max battery lasts a very, very long time. Screen-on time can clear 10 hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4DEch"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is a more complicated story. I think that if you’re the sort of person who isn’t completely glued to their screen for much of the day, you’ll find that at the end of that day, the 13 Mini will still have some juice. That’s a definite improvement over last year’s iPhone 12 Mini, but it nevertheless still doesn’t last as long as larger phones — including both the iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vuqH3t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 and 13 Mini review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2Dz1cz"&gt;In my initial review of the iPhone 13 Mini, here’s what I had to say: “The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them.” The difference this year is, instead of having to make major changes in my phone habits, I only had to make modest ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRGkit"&gt;You may have seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQQCoJiZj8w"&gt;this excellent battery rundown test&lt;/a&gt; from Arun Maini (aka Mrwhosetheboss). Maini’s video is excellent because through the entire timelapse, you can see exactly what activities the phones are doing as they drain down, and it’s a big array of stuff. His result has the iPhone 13 Mini outlasting last year’s iPhone 12. I don’t have the two to compare directly myself, but in my daily usage of the Mini this year, my battery life hasn’t been quite that good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lmOtVr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IQQCoJiZj8w?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q3STxh"&gt;This is all very fuzzy, but that’s the nature of battery testing in the real world. We all use our phones differently, and so predictions are necessarily vague. But the fact that we use our phones differently is the point: the iPhone 13 Mini is a phone that I believe &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be used differently.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q72GubsK29ZL7erXjL73Erpry6k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865101/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life is much improved, but not so much that you can use it as much as you would use a larger phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TtyHha"&gt;As with the iPad Mini, the smaller screen here subtly influences your behavior in ways that aren’t immediately obvious. Even though it runs the exact same software as the 13 Pro Max, the iPhone 13 Mini encourages more sporadic use for shorter periods just because it’s smaller and less immersive. If you can adapt your phone usage to fit, it’s great — and definitely better than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqdIXv"&gt;The same insight applies to the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Its gigantic screen also encourages a different kind of use — specifically more of it. But because it simply can have such a huge battery inside (and perhaps because it can vary the refresh rate of the screen), those behaviors don’t affect how long it lasts as much. Physics is physics, and the battery in the 13 Pro Max is physically huge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;So are bigger cameras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ar2R52"&gt;What, really, do you want out of a new phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAdrAJ"&gt;Assuming you’re starting with a good foundation, I think the list of what really makes a big difference in phone upgrades is actually short. The first thing on the list is improved battery life. The second is an improved camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmuVya"&gt;Those are the two things that make a fundamental difference in your day-to-day experience of a smartphone (assuming, again, that the basics don’t stink). Those are also exactly the things Apple tried to make better in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmhHh"&gt;Those two improvements come on top of the major changes the company introduced last year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have an iPhone 12, this year’s update looks iterative because it is. If you have an older iPhone, the full list of what’s better on the iPhone 13 is almost too long to enumerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zm6VCR"&gt;The iPhone 12 brought new technologies and a fancy new design (and a new, Mini-sized version). The iPhone 13’s battery and camera updates aren’t so flashy, but they’re more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ca6nT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2021 to include results from longer-term testing with the iPhone 13 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IL8t4x"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5SAQtt"&gt;Unless you look very closely, it’s difficult to tell the difference between the iPhone 13 devices and their predecessors. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini introduced a striking and new flat-edged design that I still believe is a massive improvement on what came before. And of course, the iPhone 12 Mini was the first phone in a long time to bring a truly great experience to a smartphone with a smaller form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAz8c"&gt;They also switched over to OLED screens, which offer a superior experience to the LCDs that came before in several ways: contrast ratio, brightness, and power efficiency. They added 5G. They added the MagSafe charging system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHf9VU"&gt;It’s worth revisiting all those big changes because people are hanging on to their smartphones for a longer time now — especially iPhones. I think it’s fair to give the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini credit for the design they’re based on since so many of the people that are likely to buy them will be new to what the iPhone 12 offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnVRC3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini keep last year’s new design, which is still beautiful and modern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ad7gks"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some changes to that design, however. The newer iPhones are just a tiny bit thicker overall, with substantially bigger camera bumps. That means that cases designed for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are unlikely to fit the newer phones. The camera bump is not only thicker, but the lenses have been rearranged to accommodate the giant new sensor that’s in the main wide-angle camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOjSnL"&gt;The last change is that the notch housing FaceID and the selfie camera has been shrunk down by 20 percent — but don’t get too excited by that. It’s only been reduced on the horizontal axis, so the extra screen you get doesn’t amount to much (and Apple isn’t using it to show more info, like battery percentage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijCuBt"&gt;There is a new processor inside the iPhone 13: the A15 Bionic. As usual with iPhones, it’s difficult to discern significant speed improvements, but that is only because there’s so much headroom that iPhones tend to feel fast for longer. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; models get one more GPU core than the regular models, but I haven’t noticed that make a difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGFILf"&gt;One difference that does matter this year: the base storage on the least expensive iPhone 13 and 13 Mini has been increased to 128GB. I’m frankly impressed that Apple actually managed to proactively increase the base storage on its own — historically, it’s always done it far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNUALy"&gt;Finally, my favorite design improvement over the iPhone 12 is that there’s a new pink color option. Of all the colors offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro lines, it is the best one. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UzmY4E"&gt;iPhone 13 battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DyoBG1"&gt;Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 wasn’t quite what I had hoped for. Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 Mini was sadly exactly what I was expecting: not very good. So for this year’s iPhone 13, Apple did the obvious thing: it made the batteries bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i3hCp"&gt;Those larger batteries (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;9 percent on the iPhone 13 Mini and 15.1 percent on the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;) are the main driver behind Apple’s battery claims this year. It says that the regular iPhone 13 should last for a whopping two-and-a-half hours of usage longer than the iPhone 12, while the Mini will last an extra one-and-a-half hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjzzSH"&gt;Of course, if you don’t have an iPhone 12, then the 13 lasting more than two hours longer is kind of meaningless. My takeaway for the regular iPhone 13 doesn’t require relative comparisons, though: battery life is &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="D80PRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the regular iPhone 13 is excellent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The best iPhone 13 color is pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bz6C5n_5q6wqP6YwubUJe0TiFTs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865100/vpavic_210917_4760_0702.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best iPhone 13 color is pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZq1pC"&gt;On one day of my testing, the regular iPhone 13 made it from 7AM to midnight before it tuckered out. That was with some camera testing, watching some video, the usual doomscrolling, emails, work, and some games. It was an intense set of work for the five hours of screentime that day, so that’s impressive. On another day with lighter usage, I didn’t see the battery warning until the following morning. But the iPhone 13’s battery isn’t magic. When we had a day of a lot more 4K video testing, I was looking for a charger by 7 or 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpsctz"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Mini, its battery life is much improved over last year’s 12 Mini, but not quite enough for me to throw caution to the wind and recommend it to anybody who wants a smaller phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG1uGw"&gt;With last year’s 12 Mini, I had to significantly change my phone usage to get it to last through an entire day. This year, I only had to modestly change my behavior. I think that if you’re not glued to your screen for many hours a day, the 13 Mini crosses a line of battery usability the 12 Mini didn’t quite manage to even approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDdZcZ"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic, both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUdOYU"&gt;My takeaway on the Mini is to not assume the improvements are enough to overcome the fundamental physics of smaller batteries. My takeaway on the regular iPhone 13 is also based on fundamental physics: a big battery means good battery life.TKENDNEW&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mx8zAg"&gt;iPhone 13 cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="we6MM5"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 and the 13 Mini have the same camera system: a regular wide-angle camera and an ultrawide. Both have been upgraded, but the major improvement comes to the wide angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoUUi"&gt;Just like the battery, the improvement to the wide-angle camera sensor is simple: make it bigger. A bigger camera sensor is able to take in more light more quickly and produce better results. Apple happened to have just such a sensor lying around: the one from last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fL0gC"&gt;That’s notable because the 12 Pro Max stood apart from all the other iPhones last year by having a larger sensor, and now that sensor is the new default this year. And from the moment the 12 Pro Max was released up until now, it has been the best smartphone camera on the market for both photos and video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VjTrGuWAMFmPyScPTB9djo0A8Yo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865823/reg_IMG_349707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2dYr"&gt;I am happy to report that the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini match or improve on those results. Details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK3aL7SdxtoZdNYIDKstB8elqXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865828/reg_IMG_353019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JM7TdrsrLJYm9dbvXOZlnwz7cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865827/reg_IMG_352918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vOttW3"&gt;Video quality is great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow mo and handles them all super well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZvLuN"&gt;Really, the only way to be unhappy with this camera is to compare it head to head with an iPhone 13 Pro — and even then, I think you’d probably need to do it on a big screen with images taken in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBEaB7"&gt;The ultrawide sensor was also updated for better low-light performance, but it’s fairly minor. What I mostly see is improved white balance and color when it’s in night mode. That’s something I’ve noticed across the board, actually. Especially in low light, colors are a bit more true to life than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lw3g2e"&gt;My main wish is that the selfie camera sensor had been updated. It has some software improvements just like the other cameras, and it’s inside a smaller notch now, but the selfie camera is too important for Apple to just leave the same this many years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRzGOJ"&gt;Apple has also introduced two new camera modes with the iPhone 13: Photographic Profiles and Cinematic Mode. I have gone in depth on both of those features in the iPhone 13 Pro review, so you can read the full details on how they work there. But I’ll briefly describe each here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diFHrJ"&gt;Photographic Profiles are a new option in the camera that change the default look of the picture you’re taking. You can customize the tone and contrast of how all the pictures you take look instead of doing it in edit after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJvyOk"&gt;You may know that Samsung phones take super vivid photos or that Google Pixel phones take photos that are more contrasty and blue. With Profiles, Apple is essentially admitting that people may prefer those looks and is providing an option to get them automatically.  You can also customize each one to your own personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAxJoO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14G7Xz"&gt;Profiles aren’t like filters in that they don’t apply tone and warmth settings to the whole picture. The iPhone knows when it sees grass or faces or sky, and so it adjusts how it applies those color preferences accordingly, so you don’t get weird-looking skin tones or purple skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s27evH"&gt;Photos taken with a Profile can’t have adjustments removed or changed (beyond normal editing) after the fact, and you can’t use RAW at the same time as profiles. It’s handy sometimes to think of them as presets, and I think I will use them from time to time. Apple claims that the A15 Bionic is necessary for the whole Profiles experience to work, but my feeling is that it ought to be possible to get this feature on older iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXGPhT"&gt;Cinematic Mode is a new feature that is essentially the equivalent of Portrait Mode but for video. It locks on to a face and blurs the rest of the scene, just like if you were using a lens with a big aperture. But it then tries to change the focus as it sees fit, shifting over to a face in the background if a face in the foreground turns away, for example. As you shoot the video, you can manually change focus yourself, or you can do it after the fact in the edit — but only inside Apple’s own apps like Photos or Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSqAOZ"&gt;The results from Cinematic Mode are nowhere near as good as Apple’s own commercials would have you believe. It doesn’t work well (or really, at all) in low light, and it has the same problems you may remember from the early days of Portrait Mode photos: weird cutouts around hair and glasses. It also only works in 1080p at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="37B8pX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czKzIA"&gt;But don’t let the fact that Cinematic Mode doesn’t live up to the hype distract you. The camera systems on the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are excellent. If there wasn’t also the iPhone 13 Pro in the world, they’d be the best you could get on a phone as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4G3eE5B21Pg_Xg9awwQwwBAsnHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863273/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RAOPHA"&gt;I think it’s all too easy to look at the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini and not think much of the updates this year. Cameras get better every year, and every company promises good battery life, after all. And compared to the massive changes we saw on the iPhone last year, the 13 looks iterative, more like an iPhone 12S than truly new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KV4QJn"&gt;I won’t pretend that reading is totally wrong, but I also think it misses the point. Fancy new features are fun, but the fundamentals of battery life and camera are more important. Because if you focus on the fundamentals, your whole game gets better. And the iPhone 13 has got some good game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="llBFDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smooth operators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lVLDlO"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are phones designed for people who care about the details. The improvements over last year’s iPhones are significant but not obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYOJiC"&gt;Just as with the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the most important upgrades on the 13 Pro are to battery life and the camera system. The 13 Pro adds a third major improvement with a high refresh rate screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZy42V"&gt;Upgrading the battery, camera, and screen sounds like an iterative, yearly update; they sound like the so-called “S” updates that Apple used to do for iPhones before its naming schemes became unpredictable. And it is true that the design is virtually identical to that of last year’s iPhone 12 Pros. But those assumptions — those words — don’t quite do justice to how big the changes really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MmKXr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated on October 5th, 2021 to include results from longer-term testing with the iPhone 13 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SieXlO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HDtzdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gMdpOS"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6BiRNN"&gt;The change that’s most likely to make the biggest impact for the most people is battery life. Apple is happy to tell you that the battery improvements come from a constellation of updates, including increased efficiency in the new A15 Bionic processor and changes to how the new display uses power. I am sure all that is true, but I’m just as sure that the biggest contributor is simply that the batteries are bigger than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDhFmY"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;13 Pro has an 11 percent larger battery, and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is an astonishing 18.5 percent larger&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s quoted improvements over the 12 Pro models are one and a half hours more usage on the 13 Pro and two and a half hours on the 13 Pro Max — and the 12 Pro Max was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a battery life monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Scpobu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The battery life improvement isn’t complicated; it’s a bigger battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ln2RL"&gt;I’ve only had the phones for a little less than a week, so I focused most of my use on the smaller iPhone 13 Pro as a kind of worst-case test. And my results are in line with Apple’s claims. On a day when we really pushed the phone with lots of 4K video and max brightness on the screen, it still lasted from early morning to 11PM with 20 percent remaining — with somewhere north of four hours of very heavy use in the screen time tracking app. A day with less intense usage clocked me at seven hours of screen on time before the low battery warning kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B0meV"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Pro Max: it is a beast. I can’t seem to kill this phone off in a day without intentionally shooting a ton of 4K video. It lasts even longer than last year’s Pro Max. I normally hesitate to enthuse about battery life because people’s phone usage can vary so much, but I can confidently tell you that the 13 Pro Max will get most people well into their second day. That extra battery adds some weight, but I think it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WII3Gv"&gt;Bottom line: I have much more confidence walking out of the house for a long day without carrying an external battery pack. For me, the line a smartphone needs to cross is that I trust I can get through a normal day without battery anxiety. Both the 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max easily get there.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQlOiN"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="occrhj"&gt;Last year was a big design update for the iPhone, with flat sides, 5G, and MagSafe charging. This year’s models inherit all of that, changing the design in only minor ways. The most obvious one is the notch on the screen. It’s slightly smaller, but only horizontally — it still pushes down into what you’re looking at to the same degree. Apple also didn’t do anything with that extra space at the top, meaning you still can’t see your battery percentage without pulling down the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK7xVY"&gt;The other design change is that the new iPhones are almost imperceptibly heavier and also thicker across the entire body compared to last year’s models. But the camera bumps on both phones are significantly bigger, which means that 12 Pro cases are not going to fit on the 13 Pro. I think the tradeoffs are worth it for the improved battery life and camera system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="pcyWDI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is virtually identical to the iPhone 12 Pro models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2z2yR_DeXfOX9MEg6-o6IBv9j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863283/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFKfj"&gt;Unlike many Android phones with gently curving displays at the edges, Apple does still have a small bezel around the screen. The rails on the edges are glossy stainless steel that pick up fingerprints, the glass on the back is a smooth matte. The front uses Apple’s Ceramic Shield finish to prevent cracks, and the camera lenses are sapphire. It’s a beautiful phone, and I think it’s a huge step up from the curved sides we’ve seen on iPhones from the 6 all the way up through the 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpGUZC"&gt;The important spec outside of the camera system and the screen is the new A15 Bionic processor, which is indeed fast. But as always with iPhones, the primary purpose of that speed is ensuring the phone will still feel fast in years to come, not making it seem faster than last year’s device. There are a bunch of camera features that seem to be enabled by the A15, however. I’ll also just point out that the 13 Pro models get five GPU cores to the regular 13’s four, but that extra core doesn’t seem to enable anything specific beyond more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l76YW8"&gt;Base storage still starts at 128GB, but at the top end, there’s a new 1TB option. That is a ridiculous amount of storage for a phone, but if you’re planning on shooting a bunch of ProRes video, then it might be something to actually consider. Screen sizes and resolutions are the same: 6.1 inches at 1170 x 2532 pixels for the 13 Pro and 6.7 inches at 1284 x 2778 pixels for the 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hoSEK"&gt;In terms of networking, Apple is focused on expanding support for Mid-Band 5G — the kind that will actually matter more than the UWB version that’s only really available on certain street corners. All that really means is that in the US, the 13 Pro is ready for a 5G future that could come if carriers keep their promises (they haven’t so far, but maybe next year). As usual, if you travel a lot, you should keep an eye on the bands available on the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/watch-out-with-iphone-13-there-are-now-5-different-iphone-models-by-country"&gt;several variants that are sold in different regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPPFI"&gt;Finally, although I know it’s a lost cause and that I sound like a broken record, I still believe that Apple should switch the iPhone from the Lightning connector to USB-C. I also still believe Apple made a mistake by not taking advantage of the obvious opportunities to do so with the big iPhone X and iPhone 12 redesigns. I understand the reasons why it hasn’t switched, and I disagree with them. Especially on a “Pro” phone, the standard cable would be incredibly convenient and useful for both charging and connecting other accessories without adapters.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8HH3XY"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XjydBk"&gt;The camera systems on the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max are identical this year, which means you don’t have to buy the bigger and more expensive phone to get the best photos.  And I do mean best photos because there isn’t another phone on the market that can match the iPhone 13 Pro. (Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 hasn’t been released as of writing this, of course, but it will have its work cut out for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQNuIQ"&gt;Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look at this photo” as many times as I have during this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6FaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best cameras on a smartphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwoSXP"&gt;I will start, however, by pointing out that this camera system is one of the things I’m referring to when I say that the 13 Pro is a phone for people who pay attention to the details. In bright sunlight or normal light, the pictures these phones take are very hard to distinguish from the iPhone 13 or even the iPhone 12. In good lighting, almost any high-end smartphone is very competent these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tB58i"&gt;Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then “pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since 2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an f/1.5 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9snyn"&gt;All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography, the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNiF1qTIUPjGNK0aDdI0Hg4KaOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864637/pro_IMG_387230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qELZZp--7dGKjSn1RqYv3uJ8lTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864636/pro_IMG_384027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHDLat"&gt;There’s less image noise in low light and more dynamic range in low and even medium light. Apple also tells me it has adjusted how it handles the black point, so shadow exposure is more accurate now, too — the 13 Pro is just more willing to let darks be dark while accurately exposing lighter areas. In situations the 12 Pro would aggressively hop into night mode and lighten everything up, the 13 Pro often doesn’t need night mode. And when the 13 Pro does drop into night mode, it goes through that exposure process twice as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qEtF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763684"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JEN10O"&gt;We used this word last year in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max review&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it applies even more this year. The camera on the 13 Pro is &lt;em&gt;confident.&lt;/em&gt; As computational photography has become the norm over the past few years, I have seen lots of camera systems — including on the iPhone — just sort of panic and do the wrong things with exposure or tone. The iPhone 13 Pro has almost never done that in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsHBzJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Is8rtY"&gt;Let’s bring things back to earth. Will most people notice the quality difference between the 13 Pro and the regular iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhones? Most of the time, I think the answer is actually no. On phone screens, you really have to zoom in and pixel peep to see it. But if there’s any place where I think it makes sense to call an iPhone “Pro” as in “for professionals,” I think this main wide angle camera is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrLtfy"&gt;The ultrawide camera also got an upgrade in terms of taking in more light, but it’s not as dramatic a difference. A more interesting upgrade is adding autofocus to that camera, which allows it to pick up a new trick: macro photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idnl0a8E2FeczI16Oy53UzoyQbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JECJG9xniss22pVNWNxDdoZ_xlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864676/pro_IMG_388931.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6Bqd7"&gt;When you bring the phone in close to a subject, you can see the camera frame switch over to the ultrawide when it’s about 10cm away. It tries to keep the same basic framing with a crop, but apparently, not everybody is enthused: Apple emailed us the night before the review to say it would ship a software update later with an option to disable the automatic switchover. Then you can keep pushing in until you’re as close as 2cm away and still have an in-focus shot. The photos it takes are better than the bespoke, throwaway macro lenses on many Android phones these days. It’s a fun feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6s3uz"&gt;The wide angle camera has gotten the most impressive upgrade, but my favorite is the new telephoto lens. Apple has set it to a 3X zoom, the equivalent of a 77mm focal length and up from the 2.5X / 65mm in the 12 Pro Max. That extended zoom does mean that it drops to an f/2.8 aperture (from f/2.2), but whatever low light losses that entails are more than made up for by the addition of night mode for this lens. Apple isn’t playing the superzoom 100X game; instead, it’s focusing on quality at the 3X optical zoom for things like portrait photography. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylna0kEm-Pig_PHBswqpjhrljDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864680/pro_IMG_016205.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz8xA"&gt;And that quality is incredible. I simply love taking photos of people with the telephoto at 3X now, getting a natural bokeh effect without having to engage the software portrait mode. The telephoto lens gets the award this year for most improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3fn2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10763698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwkE4"&gt;Apple has held the crown for best smartphone video for a very long time now, challenged (but not losing) only briefly by the Samsung Galaxy Ultra series phones in the last year or two. This year, video quality is simply amazing, at least on the wide angle camera. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization instead of just OIS makes for stable and beautiful footage even in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxNQn"&gt;Apple will also let you shoot video in ProRes this year. I didn’t have much time to test that, and ProRes isn’t really a part of our video workflow. But it’s there if you buy an iPhone that has enough storage to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFmse8"&gt;I’ll state it plainly because it bears repeating: the iPhone 13 Pro has the best camera system on any smartphone available as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNMM6c"&gt;Photographic Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TUVWr1"&gt;Apple has added two new camera modes to this year’s iPhones, both Pro and regular. Each is fascinating in its own way. Cinematic Mode is essentially Portrait Mode but for video, while Picture Profiles change the default way the iPhone takes photos. Picture Profiles are particularly interesting because they serve almost as an admission that Apple is feeling competitive pressure from the likes of Samsung and Google, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5cJno"&gt;Profiles are a new setting in the camera app that change the way your photos look by default. So instead of applying a filter after the photo is taken, you can set your iPhone to have a specific kind of “look” right away. In fact, Apple insists that Profiles are not filters at all, for reasons I’ll get into shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1v5ctq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dad4CO"&gt;The default options for Profiles include Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. Each one has its own little sliders that you can manually tweak for both Tone and Warmth. If you tweak those sliders, the name of that profile cleverly changes to match your settings (my personal favorite name is “Rich Cool,” because I imagine that’s Apple’s target demographic). When you set one of these profiles, it becomes the new default way the camera takes pictures, though it will also pop up a button that lets you toggle it off. (The button is also clever, the way it looks changes based on what profile you’ve set). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlWvlf"&gt;The TL;DR for Profiles is that “Rich Contrast” makes the iPhone’s photos look more like a Google Pixel, with bluer tones and deeper contrast. And “Vibrant” makes the iPhone look more like a Samsung phone, with more extreme colors all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WbYvA"&gt;Historically, Apple has insisted that what it aims for in photography is the “truth” of what your eye would see. I will (regretfully) set aside philosophical questions about the nature of objective reality and what a photograph is and instead just point out that it’s fair to say that when it comes to photography, Apple is much less opinionated than the competition. Samsung and Google are both more willing to tune their images to be more pleasing to their customers than Apple is. With Profiles, Apple is essentially giving its customers the option to get pictures they like better without having to edit them after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles on iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="usyFdq"&gt;Understanding how Profiles actually works is a little complicated. Apple’s computational photography process is called Smart HDR, and what it does is standard across many phones these days: it takes a bunch of photos at different exposures all at once and then combines them into a single, final image. Part of that process involves making choices about white balance, color, contrast, and so on. Another part of that process is the iPhone semantically recognizing different things in the scene — things like faces, people, grass, sky, cats, or whatever and exposing them differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qspoht"&gt;When you set a profile, the iPhone makes different choices during the Smart HDR capture about white balance, color, contrast, and so on based on the preference you set. It also uses that semantic recognition to make better choices for things like skin tone. That’s why it’s not a filter — it’s not applied evenly across the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3iOb"&gt;Profiles are not something you can undo in the edit — though Apple does label them in the metadata when you view them in the Photos app. You should also know that you can’t shoot with profiles and have RAW output on at the same time. Unlike a RAW photo where you can make all sorts of choices in the edit, Photographic Profiles lock your choices in to the file as it’s saved. In theory, it might be possible for the iPhone to save all of that extra data, but Apple tells us that it would create huge files that it wouldn’t be worth it for ordinary use and that people who do want to edit after the fact can just shoot RAW.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editing a Cinematic Mode video on an iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIe2Z"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HkyZIA"&gt;Apple’s flashiest iPhone ads are for Cinematic Mode. It’s an entirely new mode for iPhone video that uses software to blur the background of a video, much as Portrait Mode does for photos. Unlike Portrait Mode, Cinematic doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for creating a depth map — it just uses software to recognize human faces and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BFX5"&gt;The reason Cinematic mode makes for such a great demo is that it can automatically shift the focus when something happens in the scene. It locks on to the biggest face that it sees, but if that face turns away, the iPhone can automatically shift focus to somebody else in the background. It is fun to play around with and works with both the rear and front-facing Selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Es4aQ"&gt;You can also change the focus point as you’re shooting by tapping something in the background and lock focus by tapping again. And then, after you’re done shooting, you can change your focus decisions moment-to-moment in the Photos app and even change the amount of background blur for the entire video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ANjnyRUm4phHT-0w1eXsBHm6Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864316/cinematic.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tY3mZT"&gt;Because it’s the equivalent of Portrait Mode for video, it can have the same problems as Portrait Mode for photos — it rarely works in low light, for example. (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/apple/status/1438955425265696775?s=21"&gt;own ads for Cinematic Mode show it working in low light&lt;/a&gt;, which I find misleading.) It can also have weird or bad cutouts around hair, which is a little less noticeable because it’s video, but it’s still there. Finally, Cinematic Mode &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works in 1080p at 30FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nPrp"&gt;Cinematic Mode really only works well within Apple’s own ecosystem of apps. The depth map information is saved into an ancillary “sidecar” file that goes alongside the video, but only Apple apps like Photos or Final Cut can do anything with it right now. If you AirDrop it to a Mac that isn’t running macOS Monterey, the iPhone will bake all your depth choices into the file before sending it along. Apple tells us that it hasn’t worked with third-party companies like Adobe or Lumafusion to make that data editable in those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPU6ht"&gt;I think Cinematic Mode is crazy fun, but I’m not sure how much value it really adds to people who want to use their iPhone for actual, professional video work. I’m not going to say it’s a gimmick, but it is gimmick-adjacent. Like Portrait Mode in photos was at the beginning, Cinematic Mode feels like it’s a few years away from being truly useful for anything beyond casual use. Despite Apple’s promos, I have a hard time believing real movies will be made with this in its present state.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5NYQWg"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T0cjec"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max finally offer iPhone users a screen feature that flagship Android phones have had for quite a long time: higher refresh rates. Apple’s branding for its screen is “Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,” and the important part is the ProMotion, which previously has only been on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwRPY"&gt;Historically, the iPhone has been able to refresh its screen at 60Hz (or 60 times every second), but the new iPhone 13 Pros can vary the refresh rates from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz. Apple is using a type of OLED display called LTPO (&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) panel, technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;first seen on Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. It has a wide dynamic range, can get much brighter, and also uses less power because it can ratchet down the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcoWDq"&gt;What all this means practically is that scrolling and animations look much smoother. It also has battery life benefits because if nothing’s moving on the screen, the screen needs to refresh less often and therefore uses less power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Ni8VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple waited too long to introduce high refresh rate displays on its Pro phones, but it has implemented them well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T22XNY"&gt;None of this is news to Android users, but if you haven’t used a high refresh rate display on a phone before, it can be a little hard to explain why it makes a difference. This is doubly true on iPhones because Apple has gotten away with not putting a high refresh rate screen on an iPhone for so long because iOS is itself a very smooth OS without very much jank in its animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7on6Wr"&gt;When I scroll on the iPhone 13 Pro, the text stays readable instead of turning into a blur. Things moving on the screen are smoother. It feels more like a direct interaction with my finger because the iPhone can literally change its refresh rate to match my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv2at6"&gt;Apple’s implementation is also smart: iOS keeps an eye on what activity is happening on the screen and adjusts the refresh rate to match. So the screen matches the 24FPS frame rate in video apps, for example. Apple tells me apps coded with its default tools like Swift will get these benefits for free and that developers will have access to tools to update their apps to support ProMotion if they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ved8rg"&gt;I get if all this sounds very silly. It is very much a premium feature that is more about experience than anything practical. That’s exactly what ProMotion is, and it is exactly what I think we should expect from a phone that costs more than a thousand dollars. It was a similar story when Apple’s own high-density Retina Displays hit the scene. Once many people experienced the nicer thing, they were bothered by its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59ronC"&gt;I have heard all the speculation about why Apple waited this long to implement this feature, and I don’t really buy any of them. I admit that high refresh rates are the epitome of “nice to have,” but part of the point of Apple’s extravagant Pro phones is to provide the nicest experience. Now, finally, they do. Crucially, Apple did an excellent job with its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLs5Lq"&gt;The ProMotion display is the perfect example of what you get with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. It’s an improvement that may only matter explicitly to a few but will subtly make life nicer for everybody who uses it. The battery life upgrade isn’t quite so subtle, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4679X"&gt;As for the camera, I can see it both ways. When you’re sharing photos and videos to social media and looking at them on a phone, the differences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; subtle at most — but they’re there if you look for them. And if you use your iPhone’s camera for more than just Instagram, you’ll appreciate the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf4R3E"&gt;The list of significant things I have to complain about with these phones is almost astonishingly short. (Though, as you might expect, I can quibble for days about little things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;lack of a meaningful MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, the lightning port, or how iOS 15 handles notifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ven5Ti"&gt;The story of the iPhone 13 Pro is a story of iteration, sure, but iteration &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. iPhone 12 Pro owners will have to pay a lot of attention to see some of the differences, and an upgrade probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you’re using something older, all that iteration comes on top of the major improvements from the iPhone 12 Pro — the upgrades will be very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk2gK9"&gt;Either way, when you start to pay attention to the details, prepare to be impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hi9GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ar0Xom"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aef3bG"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C1HB5U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Facebook whistleblower hearing unearthed the danger of engagement algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook Whistle Blower Frances Haugen Testifies To Senate Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQ8Y-87fTml8FeosiYe6yaEye5o=/0x32:4200x2832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69959180/1235715401.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qqjfly"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; appeared before a Senate Commerce Committee subcommittee in one of the most significant hearings for the company over the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24Xpss"&gt;Haugen’s testimony followed bombshell reporting from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;last month that detailed the ways in which Facebook’s products can inflict harm on users. The &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;stories were based on a series of internal reports at Facebook that Haugen leaked to the newspaper. One specific set of reports suggested that Facebook knew Instagram was “toxic” for teenage users, especially young girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFx9pH"&gt;“Facebook has put profits ahead of people,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said on Tuesday. “I hope we will discuss whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUXy1p"&gt;Throughout her testimony, Haugen painted a picture of Facebook as both “internally dysfunctional” and unwilling to change its behaviors unless Congress, or some outside regulatory authority, decided to step in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFctAv"&gt;“It is unaccountable until the incentives change,” Haugen said. “Facebook will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35nOoQ"&gt;At the end of the hearing, lawmakers appeared eager to act and determined to pass legislation addressing the harms Facebook’s algorithms can cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPSjTi"&gt;“Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over,” Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) said at Tuesday’s hearing. “Congress will be taking action. You can work with us or not work with us, but we will not allow your company to harm our children and our families and our democracies any longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdIa8Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to scan your Windows PC for malware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of an orange triangle with an exclamation mark over an abstract timeline with circles representing events." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPVHml7FVngoH7xMmeXwGZFE9EU=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958951/VRG_4614_6_YearsofBreaches.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t85ZVn"&gt;If you think your PC is infected with some kind of malware or you just want to do a scan as part of a digital cleanup, Windows has a built-in security tool that can help you on your way — no third-party software to install or pay for. It’s called Windows Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COJUtn"&gt;Once upon a time, Windows Security was called Windows Defender Security Center, but the app is largely similar. Searching “Windows Defender” in the Start menu will bring up Windows Security, and even now, Microsoft often refers to its actual antivirus scanning as Windows Defender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W607EO"&gt;Microsoft’s built-in anti-malware software used to be thought of as totally worthless, but these days, it can hang with big names like Kaspersky and Avast &lt;a href="https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/summary-report-2020/"&gt;in independent tests&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/real-world-protection-test-july-august-2021-factsheet/"&gt;blocking 99.7% of threats&lt;/a&gt;). Microsoft has also been pushing security with Windows 11, even going so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;confusingly&lt;/a&gt; lock out people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;with older computers that don’t have certain hardware&lt;/a&gt;. But when it comes to good old-fashioned software security, Windows 11 is relatively simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFmNdN"&gt;To open it, you can simply type “Windows Security” into the Start menu search. You can also get to it by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Privacy &amp;amp; Security” &amp;gt; “Windows Security,” which will give you a quick overview of your system’s status. You can then click the “Open Windows Security” button to get access to the full app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cgxiph"&gt;After you’ve got it open, here’s some of what you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nCJLmp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Run a malware scan on Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dL024q"&gt;By default, Windows’ built-in security will run in the background and attempt to immediately block any malicious files that make their way to your computer. However, if you want to do periodic spot checks, you can manually run a scan.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p2544LYPJNUiDbU3SRbqWzhi7S8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901379/2021_10_04_17_33_38_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Security’s built-in virus and threat protection feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CzxLLh"&gt;To do this, go to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection,” and click the “Quick scan” button. If you want to do a more thorough scan, which will take longer but will check all your files and running programs, you can instead click the “Scan options” button, and choose “Full scan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61A625"&gt;If Windows finds malware during the scan, you can click the “Start actions” button to begin the process of removing the virus(es) from your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GAYKOTc1BWyw9Hd2l4E4GDVdx7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901522/2021_10_04_18_44_02_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking Start actions will remove malware from your computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GzNTzh"&gt;If the scan doesn’t turn up anything, you’ll just see a report about how long the scan took, how many files were scanned, and when the scan took place.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERwCktB4tLjsq5qFLYCGLQBzNe4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901376/2021_10_02_01_17_03_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A clean bill of health from Windows Security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uy5dVT"&gt;Keep Windows security up to date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TtqM13"&gt;If you want to make sure Windows is always scanning for viruses in the background, you can go to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection” &amp;gt; “Virus and threat protection settings.” Click on “Manage settings” and make sure the “Real-time protection” option is toggled on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUuhBz"&gt;To make sure your computer is using the latest antivirus definitions, you can go to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection settings.” Click on “Manage settings” and make sure “Cloud-delivered protection” is toggled on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEz91E"&gt;Windows 11 generally does its best to keep itself updated, but to manually check, you can go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Windows update,” which can be found both at the bottom left and top right. From there, you can click the “Check for updates” button. You can also type “check for updates” in the Start menu search bar to be taken directly to the “Windows Update” screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQrZWQf-LBQ5MhZH9uO9HGlGKL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901421/2021_10_04_17_52_42_Settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can make sure your computer is up-to-date in Settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yROqVS"&gt;If you’ve installed a lot of apps from the Microsoft Store, you can update those as well by opening the Microsoft Store, going to “Library” (on the bottom left of the window), then clicking the “Get Updates” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yEJ473"&gt;If you still have Windows 10&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jeF0Yv"&gt;If you’re running the latest version of Windows 10, the process for running a virus scan will be largely the same as on Windows 11. On some older versions of Windows 10, you’ll use the Windows Defender Security Center application instead, but the process will be much the same after you open the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QmKZj9"&gt;What are the signs my PC is infected?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N61kn5"&gt;Malware comes in many shapes and forms, but there are some common things it may do to your computer. If you notice that your search engine, browser homepage, or even desktop wallpaper have changed without you doing anything, it may be time to run a scan as described above. Other symptoms could be your computer running hotter or slower than usual or seeing popups or notifications that you haven’t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHcObs"&gt;Google has a great video describing some of the common symptoms of malware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kK7r9g"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvIXGeB1WgE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DnHhBS"&gt;If Windows detects a threat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LC44Qy"&gt;If you get a notification from the Microsoft Security app saying that it’s detected a threat, it’s likely that the problem has already been dealt with. However, it is worth double-checking the notification — some malware (especially malicious web ads) will pretend to be an antivirus notification to get you to click on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxJlpg"&gt;Windows Security notifications will look like the image shown below and will appear on the top right corner of your screen. After they disappear, they’ll be shown on the notification screen, which you can view by clicking on the clock in your taskbar. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1xv44W2XIPpXK7HDnyG7MlrKi6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901369/2021_10_01_16_22_30_Settings.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the notification you’ll get if Windows Security finds a suspicious file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Mduanx"&gt;Whitelisting a file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NR2p4t"&gt;While anti-malware software tries its best to only flag the bad files and leave the good ones, sometimes it will get it wrong. If you’re very sure that Windows has made a mistake and deleted a file that it shouldn’t have, you can retrieve it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7V9LM"&gt;Before you do so, it’s worth noting that just because you trust the person who sent you a file does not mean that the file is safe. There is some malware that is able to hijack people’s emails and send copies to everyone in their contacts. If you receive a suspicious file from someone you trust, it’s a good idea to ask them about it before trying to open it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UdW1TUyZjZLh_IjgTpdj8ILZEk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901371/2021_10_01_16_23_15_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Protection history screen will show you the incidents Windows Security has monitored.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pW5Jp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Files from trusted people may not always be trustworthy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P1UBQC"&gt;To view and restore an incorrectly flagged file, go to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus and threat protection” &amp;gt; “Protection history.” There you’ll find any threats that Windows Security found, along with their severity level. To restore a file (which, again, you should be very careful before doing), click on the entry, then click the “Actions” button to get access to the “Allow” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCck4egGYfh77YNfvHdbtq0Lpak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22901373/2021_10_01_16_23_46_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Protection history screen can give you details about a detected virus, such as where it was found, and what type of malware it is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TGC9s9"&gt;What happens after you allow the file depends on how it was dealt with. If its status is “Quarantined,” allowing it will put it back on your computer. If its status is “Removed,” you’ll have to download it again, but Microsoft Security won’t stop you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqGWJS"&gt;You can view a list of the detected files you’ve allowed by going to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection”  &amp;gt; “Allowed threats.” If you’ve decided they are indeed a threat, you can re-delete them by clicking on them, then clicking the “Don’t allow” button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lwEf1d"&gt;When things get nasty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zro6OF"&gt;Sometimes there are viruses or pieces of malware that fight back when you try to remove them. To help deal with this, Windows has a sort of extra-strength version of its antivirus scan. To run it, go to “Windows Security” &amp;gt; “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection” &amp;gt; “Scan options,” and select “Microsoft Defender Offline scan.” After clicking the “Scan now” button, your computer will restart into a special mode to do a scan. Once it’s done, your computer will restart again, bringing you back to Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGurnD"&gt;If your computer still shows signs of being infected, some of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;recommend the free version of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22705042%2Fhow-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Malwarebytes&lt;/a&gt;, which has saved our (and our relatives’) machines more than a few times. (It’s a good idea to have Malwarebytes already on your computer since some malware can block you from installing any additional security apps.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbWXPn"&gt;If your PC is still locked up, or you’re suddenly getting notifications that you need to send somebody money to unlock it, it may be time to contact an IT professional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5UIvMP"&gt;Third-party anti-malware apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XRP7WF"&gt;While Windows Security should do a good job at protecting your computer from viruses, malware, and other nasty files, there are still things it can’t do — for instance, even with Windows 11, the built-in tools won’t protect you from email phishing scams or from scam ads in your web browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3eWME"&gt;If you’re looking to step up your game from the basic Windows Security, you might want to check out anti-malware suites, such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcafee.com%2Fen-us%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22705042%2Fhow-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;McAfee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/ns-us/"&gt;Norton 360&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fusa.kaspersky.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22705042%2Fhow-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kaspersky&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bitdefender.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22705042%2Fhow-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bitdefender&lt;/a&gt;. Searching out a few reviews will give you a good idea of what you need (and what you don’t — looking at you, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/6/2/22465862/norton-360-crypto-mining-ethereum-coinbase"&gt;programs that come with crypto miners&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rcb1iU"&gt;If you’ve heard about the dangers of running multiple anti-malware systems, don’t worry; &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/stay-protected-with-windows-security-2ae0363d-0ada-c064-8b56-6a39afb6a963"&gt;Mic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeMalwareScan100521&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2Fstay-protected-with-windows-security-2ae0363d-0ada-c064-8b56-6a39afb6a963" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rosoft says its&lt;/a&gt; built-in solution will automatically turn off if it detects that there’s another antivirus installed and activated. If you uninstall the other anti-malware app, Microsoft’s should turn back on automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas is making Xbox sneakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzZUr3KNe08stEMwBl9kXT1m41I=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69958780/Xbox_20th_Forum_Tech_Copy_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lcWYvC"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox team is partnering with Adidas to create limited-edition Xbox sneakers. The collaboration will see Adidas produce an Xbox sneaker to mark 20 years since the original release of the Xbox console. The sneakers include the Xbox logo and translucent green details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgPoac"&gt;While this appears to be a limited-edition sneaker that Microsoft will use for giveaways, there will also be a separate Xbox-inspired sneaker available for purchase later this year. “This is just the beginning of our partnership with adidas, and over the next few months we’ll continue to mark our 20th anniversary by launching additional sneakers inspired by past and present Xbox console generations, including the first-ever sneaker available for purchase by our fans later this year,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/06/xbox-adidas-anniversary-partnership/"&gt;explains James Monosmith&lt;/a&gt;, a marketing manager at Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Adidas Xbox sneaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jlvzzI"&gt;Adidas and Xbox have created a launch trailer for its sneaker partnership that features footage of the original Xbox console and &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. Alongside the Xbox sneakers, Microsoft is also planning to release an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/2/22364073/microsoft-xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-skittles-twitter-brand-poll"&gt;Xbox mini fridge this holiday&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1441027928834281476"&gt;has promised&lt;/a&gt; to provide more information about its Xbox mini fridge plans at some point this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wd6GU"&gt;Microsoft’s work with Adidas on an Xbox sneaker follows a similar collaboration between Nike, Sony, and basketball player Paul George earlier this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420584/nike-pg5-playstation-shoes-sneakers-paul-george-basketball"&gt;The PS5-inspired sneakers&lt;/a&gt; went on sale earlier this year, more than &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-28-nike-pg-2-5-playstation-classic-paul-george.html"&gt;two years after&lt;/a&gt; the previous PlayStation sneakers that Nike and Sony created in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
