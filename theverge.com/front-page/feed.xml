    <title>Microsoft will let parents block kids from playing Xbox until their homework is done</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WGZXu5XYYyo0Zd45edqO0qhQY0=/0x34:911x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493291/Family_Settings_App_Hero_Img_12_9_updated.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="66qb6I"&gt;Microsoft is adding &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/xbox-family-settings-app-updates/"&gt;new screen time and game purchasing controls&lt;/a&gt; to its Xbox Family Settings app in anticipation of a gaming-filled holiday at home. Microsoft originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21271922/xbox-family-settings-app-screen-time-limits-windows-10"&gt;launched the app in preview&lt;/a&gt; during the summer, and it released the final version in September. But the company is now adding in more features so parents can better manage their children's playtime on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvgsOS"&gt;Alongside the current ability to set and manage the amount of time kids are able to play on their Xbox, parents can now also use Pause Screen Time to temporarily block an account as motivation to finish homework or hang out with family members. The block can be removed any time via the app or automatically turned off at the end of the day. If the blocked account tries to play anything while the block is on, they’ll be shown a notification informing them their screen time is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U3cq8"&gt;Microsoft is also adding in some controls over purchases that were previously available directly on Xboxes and PCs. With the “Ask to Buy” setting turned on in the Xbox Family Settings app, when a kid goes to buy something from the Xbox Marketplace, their parent will be notified in the app from which they can read more about the game and approve the purchase. With the setting turned on for an account, only purchases made with a gift card or the remaining account balance will go through without approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1WJZp"&gt;The Xbox Family Settings app is available for download now on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxfamily&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xbox-family-settings/id1507406707"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2020 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2020 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2020 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2020. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2020 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 touchscreen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Un0RYw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air is the best laptop you can buy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3k1xVZ"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 2-in-1 laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ncv6I8"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 is another great convertible laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGYHSb"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21022770/hp-spectre-x360-13-2019-laptop-2-in-1-convertible-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 13 (late 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;A gorgeous 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the midrange Chromebook to buy.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="04pBWK"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to limit alcohol or gambling advertisements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTTdzzMiy9M4grV9nbHoT3UHrXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493144/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L9tkIH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ads/greater-controls-sensitive-ad-topics-your-ad-settings/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FATHs+%28Google+Ads+%26+Commerce+Blog%29"&gt;Google has announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s rolling out the ability for users to limit how many alcohol and gambling ads they’re shown (&lt;a href="https://searchengineland.com/google-youtube-add-user-controls-to-limit-alcohol-gambling-ads-344611"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Search Engine Land&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This should be a welcome feature for users who may be sensitive to seeing alcohol use or gambling, or are looking to avoid those topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mpz5dR"&gt;While Google has previously allowed users to hide specific ads, this change affects ads category-wide. It’s also already had restrictions on the categories based on age and national laws — the change just lets users apply those limits to themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TptFG"&gt;The settings for the two categories are separate, so if you’re fine with gambling ads but not alcohol ads, or vice versa, you can allow one but not the other. It’s worth noting that the feature only promises to&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reduce the number of alcohol and gambling ads you’ll see, not eliminate them completely. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture showing the categories with buttons that say “See fewer”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XS2uDZPf32XixEtFe6xcuhvK5ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160860/Lubac_image.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The limits will only affect YouTube for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6PIss6"&gt;Google says that “[t]his feature will roll out in Ad Settings gradually, beginning with YouTube Ads in the US, and we aim to introduce this for Google Ads and YouTube globally in early 2021.” If you want to turn off either category, you can go to your &lt;a href="https://adssettings.google.com/"&gt;Ad Settings page&lt;/a&gt;. If the change has rolled out to your account, the buttons will be located at the bottom of the page. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UmCgQg"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s (CDPR) highly anticipated new roleplaying game &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;is having a bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167303/cyberpunk-2077-ps5-console-google-stadia#comments"&gt;rough release&lt;/a&gt;, and now you can add potential copyright issues while streaming to its list of launch-day hiccups. The developer says until it has a fix ready, any potential Twitch streamers should turn off all in-game music to avoid any strikes on their channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulioDf"&gt;The developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1336788550247976962"&gt;first warned potential streamers on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; officially launched in all regions, that a certain song (CDPR didn’t say which one) during the game’s “Braindance” sequences might trigger a Digital Millennium Copyright Act strike. That’s even if you’re using the &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/36734/dedicated-cyberpunk-2077-feature-for-content-creators-disable-copyrighted-music"&gt;specific in-game setting&lt;/a&gt; designed to toggle off copyrighted music for this exact reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nCNz3s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It has come to our attention that there are additional instances in the game which might put a DMCA strike on your channel. Fix is on the way but until then, we'd like to ask you to mute music in the game's settings entirely. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SS0yhyPrMo"&gt;https://t.co/SS0yhyPrMo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1337125150668558342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oScv9O"&gt;Braindance is a kind of memory replay in the world of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077. &lt;/em&gt;It appears the two sequences you play through as part of the main story feature both a copyrighted song and also some kind of bug that prevents that song from getting toggled off with the in-game setting option. CDPR advised simply turning sound off during the Braindance portions of the game to avoid receiving a DMCA strike on your channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rqymsw"&gt;But now CDPR says that the issue may be larger than it first realized, and it’s now advising streamers turn off in-game music entirely due to “additional instances in the game which might put a DMCA strike on your channel.” CDPR says a fix is on the way, but it’s not an ideal situation to have to disable all music (both copyrighted and original tracks) when streaming the game just to avoid tripping the automated detection systems that protect copyrighted works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jZO9"&gt;Hopefully the developer releases a patch soon to remedy the issue because without it, any Twitch streams of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;are going to be awfully quiet for the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastercard will drop Pornhub after finding unlawful videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mastercard And Visa Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qtQF_phv4gaH6XZ28ET1q_SRJIE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492942/1230006816.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hdmTNd"&gt;Mastercard says it will stop processing payments on Pornhub after confirming unlawful content on the site. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/pornhub-mastercard/mastercard-to-stop-processing-payments-on-pornhub-cites-unlawful-content-idUSKBN28K30C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the news, which comes as Pornhub is making substantial changes to how it moderates content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeN7s1"&gt;“Today, the use of our cards at Pornhub is being terminated. Our investigation over the past several days has confirmed violations of our standards prohibiting unlawful content on their site,” Mastercard spokesperson Seth Eisen tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As a result, and in accordance with our policies, we instructed the financial institutions that connect the site to our network to terminate acceptance. In addition, we continue to investigate potential illegal content on other websites to take the appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZFXTG"&gt;Pornhub came under fire after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-rape-trafficking.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; finding nonconsensual pornography, recordings of assault, and videos of underage girls on the site. The company called claims that it allows child sexual abuse material “irresponsible and flagrantly untrue.” Soon after, however, Pornhub &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164031/pornhub-upload-limit-blocked-download-nyt-kristof-child-abuse"&gt;banned uploads&lt;/a&gt; by unidentified users and blocked downloading videos from the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlLsb3"&gt;Payment processing giants Visa and Mastercard confirmed earlier this week that they were conducting independent investigations of Pornhub content. “When we identify illegal activity, our policy is to ask the acquirer to terminate the relationship, unless an effective compliance plan is put in place,” Mastercard &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/visa-mastercard-pornhub.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visa said that it was “actively engaging with the relevant financial institutions,” as well as Pornhub’s parent company MindGeek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3I33G"&gt;So far, Visa has not announced the results of its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cydia sues Apple alleging its App Store has a monopoly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JLXcNOYkab9yhLKyNXchk1tCBCY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492814/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUF9BT"&gt;A new lawsuit from the creator of jailbroken iOS app store Cydia claims Apple used anti-competitive tactics that froze out Cydia and other would-be rivals when it created its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SM9vdW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160777/cydia_sues_apple.pdf"&gt;Apple, the lawsuit states&lt;/a&gt;, “began coercing users to utilize no other iOS app distribution service but the App Store, coupling it closer and closer to the iPhone itself in order to crowd out all competition.” The company is seeking a jury trial and unspecified monetary damages: “This lawsuit seeks to open the markets for iOS app distribution and iOS app payment processing to those who wish to compete fairly with Apple, and to recover the enormous damages Apple caused.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jjFL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saurik"&gt;Software developer Jay Freeman&lt;/a&gt; launched Cydia in 2007, before Apple had established the App Store. After the launch of the App Store, Cydia became a way for users to install apps, tweaks, and software that hadn’t been approved by Apple. The lawsuit alleges that the early iPhones were limited in functionality and came with “only a handful of Apple apps,” and they were not able to install third-party software or additional apps. Over the years, Apple made it more difficult to jailbreak iPhones and, the lawsuit alleges, discouraged developers from using non-Apple app stores. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/16/18143422/cydia-disables-in-app-purchases-ios-jailbreak-store-apple-iphone"&gt;Cydia shut down new purchases&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Vsg5T"&gt;Cydia’s lawsuit, first &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/cydia-apple-lawsuit/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, claims that Apple now has a monopoly over iOS software distribution. “Were it not for Apple’s anticompetitive acquisition and maintenance of an illegal monopoly over iOS app distribution, users today would actually be able to choose how and where to locate and obtain iOS apps, and developers would be able to use the iOS app distributor of their choice,” according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wofQOR"&gt;Apple says it plans to review the lawsuit and continues to discourage people from jailbreaking iPhones for security reasons. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.norton.com%2Finternetsecurity-mobile-android-vs-ios-which-is-more-secure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167964%2Fcydia-sues-apple-monopoly-anticompetitive-iphone#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 study from antivirus company Norton&lt;/a&gt; found that Apple’s stringent controls over what apps are allowed into the App Store made iOS devices somewhat more secure than those running the more popular &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/"&gt;open-source Android&lt;/a&gt; operating system. However, the US Copyright Office has established that iPhone &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/jailbreaking-not-crime-tell-copyright-office-free-your-devices"&gt;jailbreaking is not illegal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5mD8q"&gt;Cydia is the latest company to allege Apple has engaged in anti-competitive behavior. In August, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366259/epic-fortnite-vbucks-mega-drop-discount-iphone-android"&gt;introduced a new direct payment system&lt;/a&gt; in its popular &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;game&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to bypass Apple’s 30 percent fee. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple kicked &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; off&lt;/a&gt; the App Store for violating its rules, and Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;responded with a civil lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Apple, alleging that the iPhone maker was violating antitrust law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHsLb9"&gt;A judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21492334/epic-fortnite-apple-lawsuit-restraining-order-unreal-engine"&gt;granted an injunction&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Apple from retaliating against Epic’s Unreal Engine platform, but refused to grant an injunction that would have restored &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in Apple’s App Store. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427779/apple-epic-games-breach-of-contract-lawsuit-fortnite-app-store"&gt;said it would seek damages&lt;/a&gt; against Epic for allegedly breaching its contract with the iOS App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHSB18"&gt;In September, several companies that have criticized Apple — including Epic, Spotify, Basecamp, Match Group, Tile, Blix, and Deezer — created the &lt;a href="https://appfairness.org/"&gt;Coalition for App Fairness&lt;/a&gt; to “create a level playing field for app businesses and give people freedom of choice on their devices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFASqY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQQF3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OY5zML"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is fixing SMS issues that knocked out texting for some Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_ByZy1tCtlO6YRLOGLQnxX4LZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492692/wjoel_180413_1777_android_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wtn7iX"&gt;SMS messages have stopped working for some Android users, and it appears Google is rolling back some changes to help fix the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSgvjG"&gt;The issue seems to be due to a recent update to the Carrier Services app, which “enables the latest communication services from mobile carriers, including battery-optimizations and support for enhanced features in the Android Messages app,” according to the app’s description &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.ims&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;on the Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. The app has more than a billion installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVMpxj"&gt;Version 50 of the app started rolling out on December 2nd, and reports of issues with SMS started hitting around then, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/10/carrier-services-sms-android-issue/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus, LG, Motorola, Samsung, and TCL phones have reportedly been affected. If you’re seeing issues, uninstalling the app fixes the problem, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5kgh5"&gt;As of Thursday, though, Google has reverted the recent update and is downgrading people back to version 48 of the Carrier Services app, reports &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/10/google-is-rolling-back-a-carrier-services-update-to-fix-sms-issues-on-some-phones/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;writer saw that their Carrier Services app was reverted as well. And the Play Store listing for the app now lists version 48 as the most current version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65EwVj"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making a 3D animated Sonic the Hedgehog TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GWs6cWZN1wMUs5NEzTbuhaKneWg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492540/netflix_sonic.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NX on Netflix (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XycOQf"&gt;Netflix is making a 3D animated &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; TV show, the company announced in a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425"&gt;since-deleted&lt;/a&gt;) tweet from its NX Twitter account. The series, set to debut in 2022, will be based on the character from the long-running Sega games, although there are no specific details yet as to what the show will entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y3VF2"&gt;The series is being produced in partnership with Sega, along with &lt;a href="https://www.wildbrain.com/"&gt;WildBrain&lt;/a&gt; (a production company behind numerous popular children’s TV shows) and Man of Action Entertainment (best known for &lt;em&gt;Ben 10 &lt;/em&gt;and Disney’s&lt;em&gt; Big Hero 6 &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pR8vkw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gotta go fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRBpl4"&gt;While there’s not much information about the series itself, Netflix’s teaser image shows a silhouette of the modern 3D Sonic design (as opposed to the chubbier and stubbier “classic Sonic” that’s featured in games like &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;.) Assuming that teaser image is representative of the show, it also appears to be ditching the more recent character designs from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Boom&lt;/em&gt; spin-off games and TV show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L0guz"&gt;The new Sonic series would mark the latest video game-based TV show for Netflix, which also has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348468/netflix-splinter-cell-animated-series-adaptation-witcher-castlevania-john-wick"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series in the works. The streamer also already offers several seasons of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; (albeit one that targets a more mature audience than the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; show.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile introduces its first 5G hotspot and a 100GB standalone plan for $50 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inseego 5G MiFi M2000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eii8RH05Dwh2GCU0S5eWBi21LWY=/0x1:1832x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492516/Moretti_generic_top_006.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will start selling the Inseego 5G MiFi M2000 today. | Image: Inseego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3nfzJ"&gt;T-Mobile might look as thought it’s late to the game by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2F5g-just-got-better&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unveiling its first 5G hotspot today&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of 5G standalone hotspot plans. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699111/verizon-5g-mifi-m1000-hotspot-650-expensive-data"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; have offered 5G hotspots for a while now (although they began with significantly limited coverage). But T-Mobile’s particular blend of wide 5G coverage and better-than-LTE speeds means the device should be more accessible to more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaXk2X"&gt;Plus, the carrier’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete, starting at $30 for 10GB and $40 for 30GB, and topping out at 100GB for $50. In comparison, AT&amp;amp;T’s standalone hotspot plans start at $60 per month for 15GB; Verizon’s offerings start at $80 for 15GB of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SGbE23"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcgrj"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftablet%2Finseego-5g-mifi-m2000&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Inseego 5G MiFi M2000&lt;/a&gt; hotspot is available now through T-Mobile and costs $336 to purchase outright. For now, the carrier is offering to knock that down to $168 if you add a new line and spread the payment across 24 months. The M2000 has more than 24 hours of battery life and is capable of connecting up to 30 devices at once, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1UE9h"&gt;A reminder: 5G comes in several flavors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;not all are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile has taken a multi-layered approach with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538604/t-mobile-5g-network-midband-coverage-expanded-cities"&gt;aggressive expansion schedule&lt;/a&gt;, working to grow overall coverage quickly as well as bolstering its midband offerings, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquisition of Sprint’s network&lt;/a&gt; last spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues Music Memos app with one final update</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYN4m9slp1e2j8Zj49JFyKaW8U=/222x0:2418x1464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492493/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_2.26.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h5INn4"&gt;In 2016, Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/20/10797250/apple-music-memo-app-announced-iphone-ipad-free"&gt;a new iPhone app called Music Memos&lt;/a&gt;. It was meant to expand on the built-in Voice Memos app’s ease of use while adding some features for musicians. You could record something with an acoustic guitar or piano in uncompressed audio, and Music Memos would detect the chords you played and could also add in drum and bass backing tracks that kept with your tempo. You could name those tracks and give them star ratings, or tag certain parts of a recording like the bridge or chorus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0LQUK"&gt;But considering how infrequently Apple updated Music Memos after its release, it’s fair to assume that the app never took off like the company might’ve hoped. It was an awkward middle child between the wonderfully simple Voice Memos and more capable GarageBand. And today, as noted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/10/apple-music-memos-voice-memos-integration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has confirmed that Music Memos won’t be getting any further updates. The one released today, version 1.0.7 — we never even made it to 1.1, folks — allows users to export their Music Memos recordings to Voice Memos. You can still export tracks to GarageBand just like before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvmWZx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple Music Memos makes mobile recording easy|6279" data-volume-uuid="774e98a08" data-volume-id="6279" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-681" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s all take a trip back in time and rewatch our 2016 video about Music Memos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyiE5Y"&gt;You’ll now see a “Recording is moving to Voice Memos” prompt when you open Music Memos. Tapping “export” will send all of your stuff over to Voice Memos in a folder labeled Music Memos. You can also just tap “OK” to dismiss the export reminder for another week. If you create new recordings with Music Memos after exporting, just remember to copy those over as well. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211824"&gt;Here’s an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the transition process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lq9KL"&gt;Apple says that Music Memos will be unavailable to download after March 1st, 2021 for new users; if you’ve already installed it previously, it’ll remain available in your App Store library. But it won’t be getting any further development — not that it had received much attention in years anyway. Apple made a few bare minimum updates to the app in the past, adding support for new iPhone display resolutions and so on, but that’s pretty much it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic-memos%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22168102%2Fapple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s the website for the app&lt;/a&gt;, but it might not be around for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;
