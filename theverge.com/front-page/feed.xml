    <title>Amazon quietly opens its eleventh Fresh store, reportedly plans 28 more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z4xP_yJ7vqucmvKLEZXvP5itwvk=/0x1:8510x5674/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947626/DashLane.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Fresh stores feature its high-tech Dash shopping carts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9hcMp"&gt;Last Thursday, Amazon opened its 11th Amazon Fresh grocery store, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/amazon-quietly-began-building-a-grocery-chain-during-pandemic?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a remarkably quick expansion of the initiative considering Amazon only opened its first store of this type on an invite-only basis in August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. The company doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon either, with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporting that it has plans for at least 28 more locations (though Amazon was only willing to confirm five of these).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWB1fc"&gt;Amazon’s Fresh stores are just one part of the company’s growing collection of retail stores. They’re meant to be less upscale than Amazon’s Whole Foods locations, and bigger than the company’s Go and Go Grocery locations. In the US, they also don’t use Amazon’s cashierless “Just Walk Out” technology, although the company says it’s testing it with a Fresh store in Illinois. The Fresh stores still feature high-tech elements like its touchscreen-equipped Dash shopping carts, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNAPQ1"&gt;Despite the rapid expansion, Amazon’s plans still trail traditional retailers. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Aldi has plans to open 100 more stores in the US this year, on top of the &lt;a href="https://corporate.aldi.us/en/aldi-history/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20Batavia%2C%20Illinois%2C%20ALDI,store%20in%20Iowa%20in%201976."&gt;more than 2,000 stores&lt;/a&gt; it already has in the USA. Walmart has &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/locations/united-states"&gt;over 5,000 stores and clubs&lt;/a&gt;, and even Amazon’s own Whole Foods has approximately 500 locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5n3fC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd5538"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP9PQ9ME_gfB9dweKHvjtlEq0RE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947568/DSCF7577.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="26hpQt"&gt;After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It’s also an important device for Oppo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently overtook Huawei&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival’s troubles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNJdHd"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone’s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2-&lt;/em&gt;style liquid metal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li_PZuoMOeFQdhkYRQU8RIWZ1lY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362260/DSCF7572.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Sbic"&gt;The camera system itself is no less unusual. There’s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we’ll have to see how that bears out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqWHj8"&gt;There’s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn’t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it’s more like a microscope than a macro lens — you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there’s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I’m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it’s pretty cool. Here’s a quick shot of my computer monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZdLCMaTM4xe51OWFwIKTXjA2t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362255/IMG20210311143520_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrXP2"&gt;You’ll notice that the whole shot isn’t quite in focus, and that’s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close — you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQIVVq"&gt;One notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it’s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That’s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won’t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2ZGfAfwu3JOBgQC-Q2ad5yxCmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362261/DSCF7578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tWxaBM"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s display is another key feature; it’s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it’s a 10-bit panel and that it’s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKe3mQ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo’s off to a good start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbpxC7"&gt;We don’t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for Android can now preview a page before opening a link  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixAW3KHw6_GkbTqNRbP30o1bCyU=/423x0:4983x3040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947421/Screenshot_20210311_101409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Preview page” now appears an an option when you long-press a link.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KTqJnD"&gt;Chrome’s Android app now lets you preview a webpage before committing to clicking on a link, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/10/chrome-android-preview-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature appears to have been enabled via a server-side update to version 89 of the browser, and can be accessed by long-pressing on a link and then tapping “Preview page.” It seems to be Android-only for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLpx4W"&gt;It’s a small, but helpful, feature if you want to quickly check the contents of a webpage without fully leaving your current page. Maybe that’s to get the gist of an article by reading its first couple of paragraphs, or because you’re still vigilant about being Rick-rolled in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1aTxo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A small but helpful addition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akut7K"&gt;The feature has been included in other browsers for a little while now. On iOS, both Safari and Edge already default to previewing a webpage when you long-press a link, and by default neither require the additional step of selecting “Preview page” from a menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhxMS2"&gt;Chrome’s support for link previews on Android has been in the works for a little while, and was spotted while it was in development way back in December 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-sneak-peak-page-loading/#:~:text=To%20enable%20this%20feature%2C%20you,link%20you%20want%20to%20preview."&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, however, it appears to be available to everyone without having to be manually enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox TV era ends in May with the removal of OneGuide TV listings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PpUTEGURpP6NZv9A42dCkewTGKo=/4x0:835x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947385/xboxtv.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Xbox One with Kinect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJ9e9b"&gt;Microsoft is removing its TV listings feature on the Xbox One in May. Originally introduced as part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;broad ambitions to take over the living room&lt;/a&gt;, the OneGuide TV listings on Xbox One was designed to overlay on top of your cable box and provide a better way to access content. You could also combine the feature with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/7/5978423/xbox-one-digital-tv-tuner-features-release-date-pricing"&gt;Xbox USB TV tuner&lt;/a&gt; to access free-to-air TV channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKIwOv"&gt;“Based on customer usage and feedback, we’re constantly evolving the Xbox experience,” says Jonathan Hildebrandt, a program manager for Microsoft’s Xbox Experiences group. “To that end, beginning this May we’ll be sunsetting live TV listings for OneGuide on Xbox One.” OneGuide users will still be able to access the HDMI passthrough feature on the Xbox One  to watch connected devices, or still access a TV tuner, but TV listings will be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="msft xbox assets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFgIz6H_KkRp7UNXzCXSpACcDbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3534837/msft_912_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s OneGuide TV listings on the Xbox One.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UHi1wT"&gt;It’s the final nail in the coffin for Microsoft’s original dream of turning the Xbox One into a digital entertainment hub, or modern cable TV box. Kinect and an HDMI pass-through were central to this plan, but the $100 price gap between the Xbox One and PS4, bulkier VCR-like hardware with less performance, and the focus on entertainment muddied the waters on what was primarily a game console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdDAb"&gt;Microsoft has gradually been walking back its Xbox TV efforts in recent years with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/12/4615586/xbox-one-no-longer-needs-kinect-plugged-in"&gt;removal of Kinect&lt;/a&gt;, the Xbox One &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/25/14384132/microsoft-xbox-one-snap-mode-feature-removed"&gt;snap mode going away&lt;/a&gt;, media features disappearing, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/8/11884622/microsoft-xbox-one-tv-dvr-feature-on-hold"&gt;axed Xbox TV DVR feature&lt;/a&gt;. The Xbox One looked like a cord-cutters dream, but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12049584/first-click-the-xbox-one-isnt-my-cord-cutting-dream-anymore"&gt;quickly dissipated&lt;/a&gt; only a few years into the console’s existence. Microsoft’s latest Xbox Series X / S consoles no longer include a HDMI pass-through, or the company’s OneGuide app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tens of thousands of Verkada cameras were easily accessible to employees as well as hackers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1q_CxkE--yvZgNVdIha-n6SCCYA=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947333/Verkada_Camera_Outdoor2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DPMRFi"&gt;Employees of cloud-based surveillance firm Verkada had widespread access to feeds from customers’ cameras, according to new reports from &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/verkada-workers-had-extensive-access-to-private-customer-cameras?sref=ylv224K8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/verkada-hack-surveillance-risk/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7pLMRW"&gt;Verkada’s systems were recently breached by a “hacktivist” collective which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22322122/verkada-hack-150000-security-cameras-tesla-factory-cloudflare-jails-hospitals"&gt;gained access&lt;/a&gt; to more than 150,000 of the company’s cameras in locations ranging from Tesla factories, to police stations, gyms, schools, jails, and hospitals. The group, who call themselves Advanced Persistent Threat 69420, stumbled across log-in credentials for Verkada’s “Super Admin” accounts online. They publicized their findings, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-09/hackers-expose-tesla-jails-in-breach-of-150-000-security-cams"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; they were motivated by “lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism — and it’s also just too much fun not to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6zT6Lj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Super Admin accounts gave hackers and employees access to tens of thousands of feeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="73J2bY"&gt;Now, anonymous Verkada employees say the same “Super Admin” accounts that the hackers accessed were also widely shared in the company itself. More than 100 employees had Super Admin privileges, reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that these individuals could browse the live feeds from tens of thousands of cameras around the world at any time. “We literally had 20-year-old interns that had access to over 100,000 cameras and could view all of their feeds globally,” one former senior-level employee told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9Q9Sf"&gt;Verkada, meanwhile, says access was limited to employees who needed to fix technical problems or address user complaints. “Verkada’s training program and policies for employees are both clear that support staff members were and are required to secure a customer’s explicit permission before accessing that customer’s video feed,” said the Silicon Valley firm in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTeoAH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/10/verkada-hack-surveillance-risk/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though, cites the testimony of surveillance researcher Charles Rollet, who says individuals with close knowledge of the company told him that Verkada employees could access feeds without customers’ knowledge. “People don’t realize what happens on the back-end, and they assume that there are always these super-formal processes when it comes to accessing footage, and that the company will always need to give explicit consent,” said Rollet. But clearly that’s not always the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFEcJT"&gt;Another former employee told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that although Verkada’s internal systems asked workers to explain why they were accessing a customer’s camera, this documentation was not taken seriously. “Nobody cared about checking the logs,” said the employee. “You could put whatever you wanted in that note; you could even just enter a single space.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eutQzeqtae9gxTUVUF5K7IfaRW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362279/intro_access_control.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verkada&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verkada’s cameras offer AI-powered analytics, including facial recognition and the ability to search footage for specific individuals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="baxE9u"&gt;Verkada’s cloud-based cameras were sold to customers in part on the strength of their analytical software. One feature called “People Analytics” let customers “search and filter based on many different attributes, including gender traits, clothing color, and even a person’s face,” said Verkada in a &lt;a href="https://www.verkada.com/blog/introducing-people-analytics/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Their cloud-based systems that gave customers’ easy access to their camera’s feeds also enabled the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0MsCN"&gt;The hacker collective Advanced Persistent Threat 69420 (the name is a nod to the taxonomy used by cybersecurity companies to catalog state-sponsored hackers combined with the meme numbers 69 and 420) say they wanted to inform the public of the dangers of such ubiquitous surveillance. The breach “exposes just how broadly we’re being surveilled, and how little care is put into at least securing the platforms used to do so, pursuing nothing but profit,” one member of the group told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s just wild how I can just see the things we always knew are happening, but we never got to see.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UHic9y"&gt;NASA has released an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa%2Fperseverance-mars-supercam-laser-impacts-on-rock-target%2Fs-5xUEkUbSPpW&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22324870%2Fnasa-perseverance-supercam-laser-strike-audio-recording-micrphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;audio recording&lt;/a&gt; of its Perseverance rover firing lasers on the martian surface. The strikes, which sound like a series of small clicks, are designed to help scientists analyze the rocks around the rover. In this case the target was a rock called “Máaz,” which scientists were able to discover was basaltic, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56354383"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it contains a lot of magnesium and iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfDRdh"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/microphones/"&gt;NASA’s site&lt;/a&gt;, the laser is fired by Perseverance’s “SuperCam,” and allows the rover to “zap and study areas on a rock as small as the period at the end of this sentence” from a distance of 20 feet (7 meters) away. Once the laser has fired at a rock, it uses its camera and spectrometer to analyze the hot gas the rock is vaporized into. The sound the laser creates offers additional data on the rock being studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LLk5Ya"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  You’re listening to the first audio recordings of laser strikes on Mars. These rhythmic tapping sounds heard by the microphone on my SuperCam instrument have different intensities that can help my team figure out the structure of the rocks around me. &lt;a href="https://t.co/nfWyOyfhNy"&gt;https://t.co/nfWyOyfhNy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1369696414456893442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kwTdUv"&gt;Since its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;successful landing last month&lt;/a&gt;, Perseverance has sent back a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291412/nasa-perseverance-rover-first-images-landing-skycrane"&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22324870%2Fnasa-perseverance-supercam-laser-strike-audio-recording-micrphone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;audio recordings&lt;/a&gt; from the surface of Mars. Although images from the planet are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/9/12411746/nasa-just-dumped-a-trove-of-photos-of-mars-dunes-craters-mountains"&gt;nothing new&lt;/a&gt;, this is the first time a Mars rover has actually used a microphone from the surface of Mars. &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/microphones/#Mars2020_callouts_microphones_sm:~:text=NASA%20spacecraft%20that%20traveled%20to%20Mars,that%20instrument%20was%20never%20turned%20on."&gt;NASA’s site notes&lt;/a&gt; that of two previous spacecraft that have carried microphones to Mars, one failed, and the other never turned its microphone on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AzvZd"&gt;All of these data points are essential to help the SUV-sized rover as it goes about its mission seeking out signs of life and analyzing the geology of the red planet. It’s currently scheduled to spend one Mars year, or two Earth years, exploring the area around its landing site, which is suspected to have been a lake billions of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valorant pro Sinatraa suspended following sexual assault allegations</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I5E1RK"&gt;Jay “Sinatraa” Won, one of the biggest names in competitive &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, has been suspended from the game and by his team following accusations of sexual assault. In a statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cIe0h/status/1369497186740928512"&gt;posted on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, Cleo Hernandez posted a lengthy account of her nine-month-long relationship with Won, detailing a disturbing history of physical and emotional abuse, supported by audio recordings and screenshots of messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5dxGJ"&gt;“I have avoided talking about any aspects of me and Jay’s relationship for over a year,” Hernandez wrote. “I never spoke about it mostly because this is horrifying, and also because I’ve seen the way women in our community are treated when they try to talk about being hurt by prominent figures.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XOTM5o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gaming can’t fix its abuse problem one person at a time","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21307560/gaming-abuse-harassment-systemic-ubisoft-chris-avellone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVPK4m"&gt;Won is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950550/sinatraa-interview-overwatch-league-mvp-san-francisco-shock-e-sports"&gt;a former &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League MVP&lt;/a&gt; who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240497/overwatch-league-sinatraa-leaving-sf-shock-valorant"&gt;made the switch to &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. Since Hernandez’s accusations, developer Riot has suspended Won from the game, stating that he won’t be participating in the &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; Champions Tour competition that’s slated to take place this weekend. “We are aware of the current situation regarding Jay Won and have launched an investigation,” Alex Francois, Riot’s global head of competitive operations, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/valesports_na/status/1369711283197472769"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIVB4j"&gt;Simiarly, Won’s team, Sentinels, has launched its own investigation and suspended the player. “While the investigation is pending, he is suspended from the team,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sentinels/status/1369717636553183238"&gt;Sentinels said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We will provide a further update once the investigation has concluded.” Won’s former &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League team, the San Francisco Shock, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SFShock/status/1369761148929593350"&gt;similarly issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying that “While Jay is no longer a member of the San Francisco Shock, we think it is important to re-emphasize our position of zero tolerance in situations like these.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoIMRL"&gt;In response, Won &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sinatraa/status/1369849384398184449"&gt;posted a statement on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, saying: “It is clear from Cleo’s recent post that she recalls our relationship differently than I do. What we do agree on is that it was unhealthy for the both of us. I apologize to Cleo and regret how things ended, but I never assaulted her in any way. I am fully cooperating with the investigations and providing the full audio and video clips Cleo referenced in her post.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szOR1F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 4:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added statement from the San Francisco Shock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXyb3F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 4:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Won. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon decrees only ‘premium’ customers can escape its slowest 5G speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfNicsIBDiN9I_ObyseevKZKQ64=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945901/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon wants to funnel more customers into its more expensive unlimited plans. | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7u1DyK"&gt;If you’re on a basic Verizon plan, you’re going to be stuck with the company’s poor performing “nationwide” 5G network — even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0JNCwmCmCg"&gt;presentation to investors&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on “premium” unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CiFr0q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Verizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS "nationwide" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI"&gt;https://t.co/JH1uTixZaI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eliblumenthal/status/1369798985016373251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="919wxO"&gt;This is essentially how the company already treats its ultra-fast mmWave 5G: customers on the base-level unlimited plan don’t have access to this network, while Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited subscribers do. Customers on metered plans don’t have mmWave access either, and likewise won’t have C-band, though they can add access to both for an additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1HI3Uz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vA0agR"&gt;That’s bad news for Verizon customers hoping that C-band would improve the poor performance they’re seeing on the company’s nationwide 5G. The network currently uses narrow low-band channels not well suited for 5G, and relies on a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to accommodate 4G and 5G traffic on the same frequencies. As a result, Verizon’s 5G speeds are closer to 4G — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;and at times even slower&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG3daF"&gt;Verizon has been limited by the spectrum it has access to, and so it spent big in the recent FCC auction of mid-band frequencies known as C-band. This chunk of spectrum is ideal for 5G, offering faster speeds than LTE with coverage that’s broader than range-limited mmWave. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;The company bid $45.4 billion on C-band licenses&lt;/a&gt; — more than double what AT&amp;amp;T spent. When these blocks of frequencies start becoming available at the end of the year, it should significantly boost the network’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmzDf5VcpUEMbWWLSRqpjNa1ac0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361438/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_5.41.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verizon predicts premium unlimited plans will make up 50% of its postpaid account mix by the end of 2023.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XITILH"&gt;And that $45 billion is just the start. Verizon revealed on its investor presentation that it plans to spend an additional $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, above and beyond its expected capital expenditure. That’s likely why the company is extremely keen to funnel customers into “step up” plans, and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49XVIf"&gt;Verizon also says that going forward, all new phones that it sells will be C-band compatible. That’s already the case for flagships like the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but not all budget or midrange phone are C-band compatible in the US. That’s one less thing for phone shoppers to have to think about when buying a phone with Verizon, but it also makes Verizon’s job of talking you into a more expensive plan easier, too. And if you’re on one of their basic plans, you might be hearing that sales pitch sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo reveals a bubbly electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KWYT634eKB98Kk6-d6ZySzCxmI=/559x259:1698x1018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945840/Canoo_PickupTruck_ExteriorSnow_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eWsDHj"&gt;No, that’s not a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Ftruck-tracked-excavator-10812&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22324096%2Fcanoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Duplo toy&lt;/a&gt; — what you see above (and in the renders below) is the design for &lt;a href="https://www.press.canoo.com/press-release/canoos-new-pickup-is-all-electric-all-american-ready-for-work-the-weekend"&gt;a pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; from California electric vehicle startup Canoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aytwfd"&gt;Revealed in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share"&gt;a leak on Reddit on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup/ev-startup-canoo-plans-to-roll-out-american-built-pod-like-electric-pickup-in-2023-idUSKBN2B3010"&gt;subsequently confirmed to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; before officially being revealed, the head-turning EV truck is not due out until 2023. By that time, Tesla’s Cybertruck, the electric Hummer pickup, Ford’s electric F-150, and Rivian’s EV pickup should all be on the road. Canoo said it will start taking preorders for its pickup later this year, but did not release pricing details. The startup is also reportedly in talks with other states for a “microfactory” where a contract manufacturer would build the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTKqVx"&gt;The toyish truck shows just how far Canoo is willing to push the design of the microbus-style vehicle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;it first debuted back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which it originally planned to sell on a subscription-only basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kov5qO"&gt;Canoo has undergone a lot of changes since it debuted that first vehicle, though. It’s now a publicly-traded company after it merged with a special purpose acquisition company in late 2020. Its new executive chairman has also refocused the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;on selling commercial vehicles based on the original van design&lt;/a&gt; and the technological platform that powers it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yJckkV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Canoo unveils a new electric delivery vehicle ahead of stock exchange debut","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xzfJ5J"&gt;But all of that doesn’t mean Canoo is exactly done trying to make vehicles for regular consumers. This new truck sort of bridges the two sets of customers, thanks in part to being loaded up with all sorts of utility features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bgwgq1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10385450"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWTo7l"&gt;There are multiple fold-down and flip-out work surfaces on Canoo’s pickup, with one in the nose of the vehicle and another on the side of the truck bed. There’s an extension that can be pulled out to make the bed a few feet longer. There are power outlets (120V and USB) dotting the inside of the bed and the storage compartments. Promo images also show the truck decked out in a roof rack and, in a bid to capitalize on the booming “van life” market, an “overlander” trim with a camper shell and a pop-up tent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS6oQL"&gt;This is all in keeping with the vision of Canoo’s original vehicle, which was decked out in pegboards on the inside that the company imagined people could use to customize and personalize the vehicle. And the ability to use the new truck’s modular features in so many different ways — and to customize them from the start when ordering — is what Tony Aquila, the startup’s new executive chairman, hopes is a big selling point for the small businesses and more adventurous consumers that Canoo is targeting. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EDQA3RZqwWvrnET8COpdllDtIRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361384/canoo_camper.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “overlander” version of Canoo’s new pickup truck.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BsNzKh"&gt;“When the working person sees this they go, ‘I can have a better quality of life with this vehicle, and I can get a return on capital.’ And every one of these areas is a space to create a return on capital, which is why we spent so much money to develop the most intelligent [truck] bed,” Aquila said in a video announcing the truck. (Canoo spent $47 million on research and development in 2018, $137 million in 2019, and $52 million through the first three quarters of 2020, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390021004077/f424b30121_canooinc.htm"&gt;recent government filing&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p17XIy"&gt;The sloped roof of the truck also tracks with Canoo’s original vehicle, though it’s a far more familiar design feature for a van. Fortunately for Canoo, Tesla has already started stretching the public’s imagination of what a pickup truck can look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YqF2p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is for America.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XE9r9S"&gt;“That was our dream, to make sure that we had a vehicle that brought a truck to the market that just really shocked people just from the visual, and then to the functional,” Aquila said in the video. “This is for America. This is what built America, anyways.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaXoUp"&gt;Canoo’s truck will be built on the same platform that powers the company’s other proposed vehicles, which means it largely shares the same specs across a number of configurations. The highest-cost all-wheel-drive truck will have around 600 horsepower and more than 200 miles of range, while the lower cost versions will get closer to 100 miles of range and feature a single motor in the rear. (Aquila &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-canoo-evs-pickup-idUSKBN2B3010"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he thinks Canoo can find a way to up the range to 300 miles by the time it’s released.) The truck also uses the same brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire system Canoo developed for its other vehicles, which reduces complexity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpcdNR"&gt;These technologies have made it possible for the startup to mate so many different designs to the same underlying technological platform. They’re also things that drew the interest of Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;which at one point wanted to acquire Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; exclusively reported earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mColVy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 10th, 9:58PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details from the Reuters report. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop’s stock was on the rise again, until it wasn’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GameStop photo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npqYaqrq8sMAUj8taytLLU1Ouyw=/2x0:998x664/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68945712/gamestop-photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i7pWNZ"&gt;GameStop stock (GME) soared in value on Wednesday, peaking at $348.50 per share. Then, in an event that’s &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not cause for concern, minutes later it lost fully half its value by plummeting to $172, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-10/gamestop-s-winning-streak-keeps-going-amid-cohen-shakeup-plan?sref=vuYGislZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Yes, “stonks” are back, and GameStop is once again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;in the crosshairs of online amateur investors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0TRQF"&gt;Wednesday’s drama ultimately ended with the price settling back down to $265 per share, but it’s hard to not feel déjà vu. It seems like it was only yesterday when everyone was watching in a mixture of shock, amusement, and general concern as GME crested $483 per share. The rise and fall doesn’t quite compare, but the losses for anyone who sold during Wednesday’s dip in price are likely huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wow! What a chart Never seen anything like this intraday &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*GAMESTOP PLUNGES, ERASING NEARLY ALL ITS GAIN; SHARES HALTED&lt;a href="https://t.co/a0qRraCmeN"&gt;https://t.co/a0qRraCmeN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7jpwbILOV7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7jpwbILOV7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1369703170088304643?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYggXx5R2TuyKjcyYcMh-7e0GiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360763/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_1.21.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GME’s journey from being worth $17 in January, to $260+ in March. Note the peaks during the last two major spikes in price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mipeVD"&gt;Having something you invested in suddenly worth 50 percent less can’t feel good, but it really depends when you originally bought in and if you’re still holding now: GME was worth $17 per share in January, but through some gonzo investing, the stock is now trading in the hundreds of dollars. It remains unprecedented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avHa0A"&gt;Like before, there’s no telling where this goes next, but I think it’s safe to say it isn’t over yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zd0Hv1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIZp3O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFFDoM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5ufDi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH8Iz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AsX6Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTdDCU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
