    <title>Atari’s restless ghost has released NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7reZk0pOz9ZMPBF97Brt0nl9vE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063771/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gumS06"&gt;Atari, the corporate entity / brand of Theseus, has just made around $110,000 by selling —you guessed it — NFTs (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/04/ataris-corporate-zombie-raises-110000-overnight-from-centipede-nfts"&gt;shout out to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for doing the math). The tokens in question are 3D models of the Atari 2600 game cartridge for &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; — 10 of them black, 100 of them red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiMgs6"&gt;The NFTs are being sold as part of the &lt;a href="https://www.animocabrands.com/launches-atari-capsule-collection"&gt;Atari Capsule Collection&lt;/a&gt; — which is basically a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt;-themed NFTs being sold by the company that now owns the Atari brand. The company and its intellectual property have been bought and sold so many times it’s almost hard to keep track, but the current incarnation of it is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083746/atari-hotels-esports-true-north-studio-gsd-group-phoenix-game-rooms"&gt;mainly known for trying to build hotels&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20907755/atari-vcs-troubled-development-architect-operating-system-crowdfunding-campaign"&gt;struggling to make a game console&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDKsJj547P7M1O_jRnhegIXDgVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414534/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_1.48.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This NFT, labeled as version 1 of 30, sold for around $18,000 worth of Ether.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UiqPxr"&gt;As jaded as I am, I can admit that there’s at least one interesting part of Atari’s NFT offerings: the &lt;em&gt;Flagship Centipede&lt;/em&gt;. According to the company, the NFT part is just another 3D model, but the first person to buy it will get a a real-life, original and restored &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt; arcade cabinet. But if the regular NFTs that just included a 3D model were selling for thousands of dollars, I don’t even want to think about how much that one will sell for. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2Zwy6KwfBa6KkSlwxUGdGZxlMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414557/image004.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Atari&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;Flagship Centipede&lt;em&gt; NFT, digitally signed by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dona_Bailey" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the game’s creator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. I wonder if she’ll get any of the money from the sale.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LfK86N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22332695/nft-news-stories-collection-cryptoart-memes-explainer"&gt;We talk about NFTs a lot&lt;/a&gt;, often as collectors’ items, but these ones are particularly baffling — they sold from $180.78 to over $16,000. As &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;points out that if you wanted to get a real &lt;em&gt;Centipede &lt;/em&gt;2600 cartridge, with the box, manual, and everything, you could go to eBay and spend $30 (or $53 if you want it sealed). Collector-grade versions of the game have &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F193679073442%3Fmkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336510469%26customid%3DG15153_abTestName-control%26toolid%3D10001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently sold for around&lt;/a&gt; $500, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FCentipede-Atari-2600-1981-Wata-9-0-A-Seal%2F303938082140%3Fepid%3D2489%26hash%3Ditem46c41f155c%3Ag%3AbzAAAOSwal1f39g4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;auctions for them start in that territory too&lt;/a&gt;. Even original &lt;em&gt;Centipede &lt;/em&gt;arcade cabinets cost less than some of these NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YjdwQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xL9Lx"&gt;If the point is to feel like you own something, that you’ve collected it, which would give you more of that feeling: an NFT or a copy of the actual game? The NFT would give you an entry on the blockchain, certifying that you own a 3D model (which is identical to all the other versions), but a physical cartridge can be displayed on a shelf or actually played. And that’s not even considering the physical versions that have history — you could always try to track down one of the versions of the game that Atari &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/11/6137415/atari-games-found-in-a-new-mexico-landfill-will-be-given-to-museums"&gt;buried in the desert back in 1983&lt;/a&gt;. They’ve sold on eBay before &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FAtari-Game-Over-Dig-Alamogordo-Centipede-Rare-%2F184680251456%3Fhash%3Ditem2affcd0040%253Ag%253A2wUAAOSwOFtgNnhE%26nma%3Dtrue%26si%3Dif0NSspoU%25252B38hUu0n9JLwUjg1L4%25253D%26orig_cvip%3Dtrue%26nordt%3Dtrue%26rt%3Dnc%26_trksid%3Dp2047675.l2557&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362707%2Fatari-corporate-entity-centipede-nft-sale-pong-collection" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for around $600&lt;/a&gt;, and come with an origin story that can’t really be matched by an NFT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azAneM"&gt;And if you needed one more reason why you should save your money and just buy a physical copy of &lt;em&gt;Centipede&lt;/em&gt;, here’s the kicker: those were made by the actual, original Atari, not the corporate entity that happens to own its name these days.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>French police are investigating an international Lego crime ring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="lego" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4xWjNJaByQ68D5frPfWy7EAYyQE=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063733/Lego.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EGio7"&gt;It sounds like something out of a children’s movie — after French police arrested three Polish thieves who attempted to steal toys in June 2020, specifically Lego sets. Now authorities are trying to address a growing trend of Lego robberies by warning business owners and parents, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/30/french-police-on-trail-of-international-gang-of-lego-looters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTN1zX"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/ile-de-france-le-gang-des-voleurs-de-lego-ecumait-les-magasins-de-jouets-28-03-2021-8430057.php"&gt;a report in &lt;em&gt;Le Parisien&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the thieves were part of a gang that would stay in hotels near Paris, drive around in an Audi, and “raid” toy stores for valuable Lego sets to resell in Poland. The thieves were caught robbing a PicWicToys toy store, after being spotted in 2019 and 2020 at two separate European toy stores, La Grande Récré and Maxi Toys. French police are reportedly “building a case” against the gang in response, &lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GtlMsy"&gt;The idea that plastic Lego bricks are worth enough to entice an international ring of thieves to steal them might seem odd — the priciest Lego set ever made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;retailed for only $800&lt;/a&gt; — but some sets can be worth more over time. On top of that, Gerben van IJken, a Lego specialist who advises online collectible auction sites, tells &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; that interest in reselling Lego has grown dramatically in the last year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cyNttK"&gt;Investing in these pieces isn’t new but this niche market has reached new heights with the pandemic. People have more time at home because of the health restrictions and the game market has exploded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="h7mhAK"&gt;Van IJken cites one Lego set that retailed for €150 (around $212) in 2007 and resold for €2,500 (around $2,943) in 2020. That growth in value could be due to Lego’s practice of cycling sets out of production after around two years, van Ijken says. Keeping older sets “in the vault” (reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Vault"&gt;Disney’s strategy with home video&lt;/a&gt;) makes the ones still on the market or in owner’s hands that much more rare and valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFhf4G"&gt;Lego thievery isn’t limited to France, either. A man reportedly stole around &lt;a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/ct-lego-bandit-dupage-met-0714-20150713-story.html"&gt;two million dollars worth of Lego sets&lt;/a&gt; in Florida in 2012. Given the risk, if you’ve got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345026/lego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope"&gt;collectible Lego space shuttle&lt;/a&gt; on the way, it might be time to think about security.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8vfqOe"&gt;Many Microsoft services, including Microsoft Teams and Xbox Live, are experiencing outages for some users as of Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlaQL2"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://status.office365.com/"&gt;Office 365 status page&lt;/a&gt; says there is a “DNS issue affecting multiple Microsoft 365 and Azure services.” The page also says that Microsoft has “rerouted traffic to our resilient DNS capabilities and are seeing improvement in service availability.” The company says the DNS issue has affected Microsoft Teams the most, though “other Microsoft 365 and Azure services may be affected.” The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status"&gt;Microsoft 365 status account&lt;/a&gt; first acknowledged that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MSFT365Status/status/1377738432265396225"&gt;there was an issue at 5:45PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eD4cMQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft rerouted traffic to our resilient DNS capabilities and are seeing improvement in service availability. We are continuing to investigate the cause of the DNS issue.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mU62sh"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status"&gt;Xbox status page&lt;/a&gt; says that many services have a “major outage,” including accounts, multiplayer, and cloud gaming. Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxsupport"&gt;@XboxSupport&lt;/a&gt; account said “any issues you may see with Party Chat, Matchmaking or Sign-in on your Xbox consoles is [sic] currently under investigation” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xboxsupport"&gt;at 6:55PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. The account has also retweeted recent posts from the &lt;em&gt;Outriders &lt;/em&gt;Twitter account about server issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JPZ8CG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Any issues you may see with Party Chat, Matchmaking or Sign-in on your Xbox consoles is currently under investigation.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lGjrm0"&gt;Microsoft didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMwLNg"&gt;This isn’t the only recent Microsoft services outage. Microsoft Teams, Azure, and other Microsoft 365 services went down for about four hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;on March 15th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s first UWB tracker, the SmartTag Plus, appears to be nearly here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utqWFZH02friWumTpDGxiYiKBwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063627/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NDSpPH"&gt;Samsung announced its Galaxy SmartTag line of item trackers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;, and at the time, it said the premium SmartTag Plus, which has ultra-wideband (UWB) technology that enables more precise tracking of an item in relationship to you than Bluetooth does, would be releasing later this year. Now, though, there are some clues that the SmartTag Plus could be coming out soon, possibly as early as April 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU1ugg"&gt;Perhaps the most telling hint pointing to the SmartTag Plus’ imminent arrival is that retailer B&amp;amp;H Photo already has the black model of the device available for preorder, with an “expected availability” of April 12th. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614513-REG%2Fsamsung_ei_t7300bbegus_galaxy_smarttag_plus_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362785%2Fsamsung-smarttag-plus-uwb-ultra-wideband-item-tracker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s a link to the B&amp;amp;H listing&lt;/a&gt; if you want to try to preorder a SmartTag Plus for yourself. But since Samsung hasn’t shared this date itself just yet, it’s possible B&amp;amp;H could shift this expected date if it’s not accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLRnCKyk4n3zPg1EMsjhWnEjGcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414535/Screen_Shot_2021_04_01_at_1.49.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614513-REG%2Fsamsung_ei_t7300bbegus_galaxy_smarttag_plus_black.html%2Foverview&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F1%2F22362785%2Fsamsung-smarttag-plus-uwb-ultra-wideband-item-tracker" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HITMWT"&gt;The upcoming item tracker also appeared in Federal Communications Commission filings &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A3LEIT7300"&gt;made public on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. That can be an indication that a product will be available for sale in the near future, but it’s no guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cVhlD"&gt;Samsung isn’t the only company interested in UWB tech. Apple has long been rumored to be working on a UWB-equipped item tracker of its own, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;supposedly called AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in January that Apple &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/04/kuo-airtags-ar-device-2021/"&gt;plans to release them this year&lt;/a&gt;. Tile is also reportedly preparing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;its own item tracker with UWB&lt;/a&gt;, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4pLcf"&gt;Apple has also built its U1 chip that enables UWB into the iPhone 11 and 12 series and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/15/21438497/apple-watch-series-6-u1-locator-ultra-wideband-location"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, but so far, it hasn’t used the technology for much except for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;more a precise AirDrop&lt;/a&gt;. The U1 chip will also let &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;BMW iX&lt;/a&gt; owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;wirelessly unlock their cars&lt;/a&gt; when the vehicle is released later this year in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo adds Yiddish to the menu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX7Siqcy1hGXnWA97ie_mTWFduc=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063465/SM_YiddishLaunchDayImage.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Art: Duotrope&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sQ6giZ"&gt;Duolingo, the popular language learning app, offers a wide variety of languages in its list of courses. While it’s known for teaching well-known tongues such as French, Spanish, and Chinese, it has also added courses in languages that are less widely used, such as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Hawaiian — and now, as of April 6th, its 40th language: Yiddish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fUYeF"&gt;While Yiddish in the US is known more for some of the words that have entered the popular lexicon (“He’s such a schmuck!”), it is actually a full-scale language. An amalgamation of High German, Hebrew, and Aramaic, with a smattering of Slavic languages (and more recently, English), before World War II, it was widely spoken by Jewish communities living throughout Central and Eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PW4FrO"&gt;These days, Yiddish as a day-to-day language tends to be spoken mainly in Chassidic and Haredi (ultra-Orthodox) Jewish communities, although there has been a strong interest in Yiddish among many of the descendants of European Yiddish speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyJyYwPUS1dRA82bwsMxKY54DiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414346/Image_from_iOS__4___1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQT8dkLB5MdhFrnfKDLaX7X6jjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22414348/IMG_5606__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V5GLug"&gt;For example, while my family no longer speaks Yiddish on a daily basis, my parents grew up speaking the language and sent me to an after-school program for several years so I could learn it as well. While I am no longer anywhere near as fluent as I once was, I can still manage “a bisl Yiddish” (a little Yiddish), so I asked Duolingo if I could try out its Yiddish course ahead of time to see how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYMLHA"&gt;I’m not unfamiliar with Duolingo — I’ve been using the app to try to relearn my high school Spanish — and I found that the Yiddish course follows the app’s familiar methodology. It starts by testing you on your existing knowledge of a language, assuming you’re not starting from scratch. (Mine turned out to be fair but not great.) It then starts, through repetition and examples, taking you through the basics and then into conversation, using different subjects (such as going to a restaurant).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGDvuW"&gt;The version of the app I was working with still had some beta glitches. For example, each time you click on a word, a voice is supposed to repeat it out loud, and a few of the words were missing. I was also interested to find that a couple of the words were pronounced quite differently than I was used to, but I wasn’t sure whether that was another beta glitch or an indication of the dialect being used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BD6ILd"&gt;And that’s one of the catches in teaching any language. Because Yiddish was once spread out among a wide range of countries, there was also a wide range of dialects spoken. I remember my grandparents being very amused because the dialect I was learning in school was so different from the one they’d grown up with. According to Duolingo, its Yiddish course uses the Chassidic Hungarian pronunciations because that is currently the most widely used, while the grammar is based on the version standardized by the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research (which is the grammar that I was taught).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs9L5n"&gt;I’ll be curious to discover where these differences show themselves as I proceed to the more advanced levels. In the meantime, to promote its new Yiddish course, Duolingo has arranged with several delis around the US — Katz’s Deli in NYC, Manny’s Deli in Chicago, Factor’s Famous Deli in Los Angeles, Zak the Baker in Miami, and Pigeon Bagels in Pittsburgh — to give away free bagels with a schmear (cream cheese) on April 6th to customers who try to order (with the help of some onsite signs) in Yiddish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhDUOQ"&gt;Those of us who don’t live close to one of those venues, or who are still avoiding onsite shopping, will have to make do with noshing food from our own fridges while we learn a bisl Yiddish. Duolingo is available on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/duolingo-learn-spanish-french/id570060128"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duolingo&amp;amp;hl=en"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.duolingo.com/"&gt;the web&lt;/a&gt;; the basic app is free, or you can get rid of ads and track your process for $7 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pOL0Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hy509"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Myanmar’s government shuts down internet indefinitely in response to protests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MYANMAR-POLITICS-MILITARY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvGR-UYoRsKzjbuGfKFkcpWHG44=/0x0:2800x1867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69063337/1232053175.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vdvayV"&gt;Myanmar’s acting military leadership has shut down broadband internet service indefinitely in response to ongoing protests, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/myanmar-military-internet-shutdown-bloodbath/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. The move comes two months after a military junta &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/31/world/asia/myanmar-coup-aung-san-suu-kyi.html"&gt;staged a coup&lt;/a&gt; to depose the country’s democratically elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVs84d"&gt;The shutdown applies to wireless broadband service, while a separate order banning mobile internet at night remains in effect, &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2021-04-01/myanmar-orders-wireless-internet-shutdown-until-further-notice-telecoms-sources"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The orders were given to state telecoms, though no official reason has been given.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RfX075"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;IMPORTANT⛔️ Fixed wireless will not be turned on in morning. Confirmed. No Ananda/MMNet/Ooreddoo/etc. With mobile data already off, only fixed-line will remain.  Order is temporary but open-ended. Everyone should be making whatever plans are possible.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhatsHappeningInMyanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Free Expression Myanmar (@FreeExpressMm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FreeExpressMm/status/1377587527901708288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oYYPMu"&gt;NetBlocks, an advocacy group that tracks internet disruptions and shutdowns aimed at quashing dissent, has also confirmed the ongoing Myanmar shutdown timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zw3IV1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: Mobile data is cut in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Myanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Myanmar&lt;/a&gt; for an 18th day as limited internet is restored from 9 am Thursday morning local time after the 46th consecutive night of post-coup shutdowns. Online platforms remain heavily restricted  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WhatsHappeningInMyanmar?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WhatsHappeningInMyanmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Zf5NbNvmi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7Zf5NbNvmi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NetBlocks (@netblocks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1377454979443744773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNEszD"&gt;Myanmar is currently embroiled in protests against the military government, which has responded with increasingly totalitarian surveillance and censorship measures in addition to violence that has left more than 500 dead and thousands arrested since February, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/04/01/myanmar-military-internet-shutdown-bloodbath/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZqthR"&gt;The internet shutdowns have now reached a new level of severity, with multiple telecoms ordered to shut off various internet services like mobile data, roaming, and public Wi-Fi for different lengths of time. The efforts appear designed to interfere with protestor organizing and to prevent Myanmar citizens, journalists, and human rights activists from more easily broadcasting what’s happening on the ground to the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEpyUp"&gt;In addition to the communications blackout and physical violence, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/01/world/asia/myanmar-coup-military-surveillance.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; Myanmar’s military is using surveillance drones, phone-hacking devices (including European-made iPhone hacking tools), and software for cracking personal computer security as part of a widespread digital offensive against the opposition. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube stars the Stokes Twins avoid jail after pleading guilty over fake bank robbery pranks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-YOUTUBE-CRIME" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z1X-yexegmLn8rHc5Vrc4Ukv-cU=/0x0:2178x1452/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69062893/1232048551.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Delmas / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z8TJmy"&gt;Alan and Alex Stokes, twin brothers who rose to fame on YouTube filming prank videos, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor false imprisonment and reporting false emergencies in connection with a pair of now-removed videos they filmed in the fall of 2019 in which they pretended to have just robbed a bank. The 23-year-old brothers were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356403/stokes-twins-youtube-felony-charge-bank-robbery-prank-video"&gt;charged in August of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ktdx8i"&gt;They faced a maximum of five years in prison if convicted on all counts, leading to the guilty plea in exchange for reduced sentences, according to a &lt;a href="http://orangecountyda.org/civica/press/display.asp?layout=15&amp;amp;Entry=6126"&gt;press release put out dated March 31st&lt;/a&gt; by the office of the district attorney of Orange County, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyIFUD"&gt;“The guilty pleas were in exchange for a judge reducing the felony false imprisonment charge to a misdemeanor. Prosecutors objected on the record and in a trial brief to the court’s offer to reduce the felony charge to a misdemeanor,” the press release states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8wzfnq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsuinD"&gt;Both received a sentence including 160 hours of community service and one year of probation in addition to both having to pay restitution. The Stokes brothers are also barred from returning to the University of California Irvine, where they filmed the prank videos, and they were also ordered not to produce any more videos “that mimic criminal behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECCuIT"&gt;The videos in question involved the Stokes brothers dressing in black garb with face masks filming themselves interacting with strangers, some of whom were distraught at the prospect of encountering what they believed were on-the-run criminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isb0Rz"&gt;In one poorly thought-out situation filmed for the videos, the brothers called an Uber driver and demanded they be taken somewhere. The driver refused, but he was later questioned by law enforcement who initially approached the man with their guns drawn, mistakenly believing he was involved after numerous bystanders called law enforcement on the brothers for thinking they were attempting to carjack the driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hmGURr"&gt;The brothers pulled this prank twice in the same day on October 15th, 2019, choosing to film the second of the two videos at the University of California Irvine after already having been questioned and released by police elsewhere in Orange County earlier in the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIQh71"&gt;“These crimes could have easily resulted in someone being seriously hurt or killed,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement. “An active bank robbery is not a casual police response and these police officers were literally risking their lives to help people they believed were in danger. It is irresponsible and reckless that these two individuals cared more about increasing their number of followers on the internet than the safety of those police officers or the safety of the innocent Uber driver who was ordered out of his car at gunpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6MEtV"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StokesTwins/videos"&gt;Stokes Twins YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; remains active with more than 6.6 million subscribers. The most recent video, titled “FUNNY April Fool’s Pranks on Friends!,” was posted two days ago, and it’s already amassed 1.4 million views. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0u91KV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10424556"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="TvQrKG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10394076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="guePeD"&gt;Currently, you can buy the Nintendo Switch Monster Hunter Rise Deluxe Edition for $370 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736568246946759989#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The console is bundled with a special-edition Switch, as well as a digital code for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; along with some DLC. Compared to other special edition consoles, this is one of the few Switch bundles that include a game with the console. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMR6NB8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock 04/06), you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with neon and blue Joy-Cons, plus a 64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $317. You can also get a similar bundle, but with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB MicroSD card for $324 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock 04/06).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $75&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $58&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $7.49&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The lowest you can grab a pair right now is for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVs713WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
