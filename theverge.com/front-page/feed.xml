    <title>Cruise starts pre-production of its autonomous shuttle thanks to $5 billion from GM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vb2kIUo94TXTV_EfbJ6GcfllTMo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455517/vpavic_200121_3874_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hIlkhm"&gt;Cruise is getting a $5 billion line of credit from General Motors’ financial division as it begins pre-production on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;Origin autonomous shuttle&lt;/a&gt;. It’s another big infusion of cash for Cruise, arguably one of the better capitalized autonomous vehicle companies in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHxmkk"&gt;Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said the new financing “bumps up Cruise’s total war chest to over $10 billion as we enter commercialization.” This will help the company as its fully autonomous shuttles enter series production at the GM Detroit-Hamtramck Plant (rebranded as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;Factory Zero&lt;/a&gt;) sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuJTEs"&gt;Ammann writes in a &lt;a href="https://www.getcruise.com/news/hitting-the-accelerator"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, “$10 billion. It’s a big number.” “However, when you think about what we’re building — safer, cleaner, and more accessible transportation for the world — you quickly realize it’s also a necessary number.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CrCEyr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“$10 billion. It’s a big number.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwV1TR"&gt;It’s a lot of money to spend on a vehicle powered by an autonomous driving technology that still is in the testing phase. Cruise hasn’t launched its ride-hail service yet, nor has it revealed an actual working version of the Origin. The company has a beta ride-hailing service, but it’s only available to employees, and Cruise won’t say when it will be available to the broader public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvCMVd"&gt;Cruise had planned to roll out a commercial service in San Francisco in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but ultimately postponed those plans&lt;/a&gt; and has yet to announce a new date. Cruise is under pressure from its investors, namely SoftBank, to launch a commercial robotaxi service. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;recently received a permit&lt;/a&gt; from the California Department of Motor Vehicles to test fully driverless cars without human safety drivers in San Francisco. And it announced plans to begin testing its Origin vehicles in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22376258/cruise-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-dubai-2023"&gt;Dubai starting in 2023&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MP0SpZ"&gt;Ammann says that over the last few weeks he has overseen the building of “nearly a hundred pre-production Origins” at GM’s Pre-Production Operations center. “These will undergo an intensive testing and validation process this summer,” he writes. “Seeing them up close and in person is absolutely thrilling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bizI7"&gt;It’s unclear whether the legal landscape regulating automobile safety will change in time for Cruise to release the Origin shuttle, which lacks traditional human controls. Cruise will need &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21125358/nuro-self-driving-delivery-robot-r2-fmvss-exemption"&gt;an exemption from the federal government’s motor vehicle safety standards&lt;/a&gt;, which require vehicles to have a steering wheel and pedals. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) only grants 2,500 such exemptions a year. (There is legislation to increase that number to 25,000, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133389/house-energy-commerce-self-driving-car-hearing-bill-2020"&gt;but it is currently stalled in the Senate&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P12Lbh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFWY7e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Another podcast goes exclusive to Spotify: Call Her Daddy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NaqKnTYYfWCduNPk8RUoAnHT7oU=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455459/CHDCoverArt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZKGmbf"&gt;Spotify continues its run on signing podcasts to exclusive deals, and this time, it’s locked down&lt;em&gt; Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;, the popular show that covers topics like sex, dating, and mental health. The show will go exclusive on July 21st, meaning the entire back catalog and future episodes will only be available on Spotify. The details of the deal weren’t shared, but &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-nearing-deal-to-exclusively-license-call-her-daddy-podcast-11623441017"&gt;reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that the licensing deal could be for as much as $20 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxbZTQ"&gt;Spotify’s goal with this deal is clear: it says the show was the fifth most popular on the platform last year, with multiple other Spotify-signed podcasters at the top of that list, as well, including Joe Rogan and Michelle Obama. This is the second big deal Spotify has inked this year. Last month, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; Dax Shepard’s &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt; as an exclusive, starting July 1st. It’s also producing and distributing shows for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21294863/kim-kardashian-west-spotify-exclusive-podcast-innocence-project-deal-announced"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176014/prince-harry-meghan-markle-podcast-spotify-exclusive-archewell-audio"&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the networks it’s purchased in its quest for podcast domination, like The Ringer, Gimlet Media, and Parcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4d9Xk"&gt;Now that the company’s signed deals with many of the world’s biggest podcasters, the question isn’t so much who’s next as how will this strategy pan out? Can signing big names really grow its podcasting audience and bring more people to the app? Will people spend less time streaming music? That’s a story Spotify will have to tell in its earnings reports in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep some of your Twitter data away from advertisers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4zs5eSG006hIp6CIU2Eg0nsrU2g=/137x0:763x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455393/Twitter-block.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDn6QQ"&gt;In April 2020, Twitter began sharing more of our information with advertisers. Notice came via a rather weird notification that said “your ability to control mobile app advertising measurements has been removed” — which basically meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21213593/twitter-data-sharing-pop-up-mobile-app-advertising-settings"&gt;Twitter was now sharing data&lt;/a&gt; such as which ads you looked at or interacted with, as well as the tracking identifier for your phone. Previously, you could turn that off — no longer. (Unless you live in the European Union or the UK, where there are extra protections.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter removed some of its privacy protections back on April, 2020." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeS_u0XJB0UY1SerbX0c2VJ_59g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659847/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.25.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter removed some of its privacy protections in April 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrg9J2"&gt;While that protection has been removed, there are still a few privacy tools that are available that can give you at least some measure of say over how much of your data is shared with advertisers. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth it to take a couple of minutes to find them and turn them off. For that, you need to go to the “Personalization and data” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NnD0vh"&gt;Using the mobile Twitter app:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8bEs6h"&gt;Tap on the three lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C8PHhb"&gt;Select “Settings and privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy and safety” &amp;gt; “Personalization and data”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="luURSL"&gt;Using the web version of Twitter:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="A7EEJw"&gt;Sign in to your Twitter account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHaXI3"&gt;Use this link to go to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/account/personalization"&gt;Personalization and data&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to you data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r9B8NHe-TFyqKU7IKZloxCsLgC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659849/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_8.46.58_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Personalization and data” page lets you disable some of the accesses that advertisers have to your data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsF0qC"&gt;The rest of this article will assume you’re using the web version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qtz9zr"&gt;Disabling ad personalization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lVRFAY"&gt;On the “Personalization and data” page, you’ll find several advertising settings that give Twitter permission to “further personalize” your advertising by using information based on your “inferred identity,” location, or other factors. (Go ahead and read all the descriptions — they’re worth knowing about.) You can choose to enable any of these settings if you wish, but otherwise, use the toggle at the top of the page to disable all of the settings on the page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dayz7F"&gt;See your Twitter data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YqzZHy"&gt;If you’d like to go a little further, and check the other data that Twitter knows about you (and possibly remove at least some of it), go down to the bottom of the “Personalization and data” page and click on “See your Twitter data.” Check all of these topics out; you may be surprised by some of the info that’s there. Here’s a short summary of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="e6mcaV"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account. &lt;/strong&gt;This is all basic stuff, like your name, age range, whether you have a verified account, and what other languages you speak. (I was amused to find that Twitter thinks I speak German. Okay, Twitter, whatever.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hwclF3"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account history. &lt;/strong&gt;This contains two separate areas — a listing of other accounts that have access to your account and a listing of places you have been. It’s a good idea to check the former to see if there are any services that have access to your account that shouldn’t; you can revoke permission on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/connected_apps"&gt;Connected apps&lt;/a&gt; page. If you don’t want Twitter to know where you are or where you’ve been, use &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/location_information"&gt;Location settings&lt;/a&gt; to turn off access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OzGMLr"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Apps, devices &amp;amp; information.&lt;/strong&gt; There are two sections here. “Apps, devices &amp;amp; information” is where you might find some of the devices and browsers that Twitter gets info from — assuming you allow it to. This is what is meant when Twitter asked to “Personalize based on your inferred identity” on the “Personalization and data page,” and it is one of the permissions that can be revoked there. The second, “Connected apps,” is another way to access several of the pages already mentioned here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyjvtP"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Account activity. &lt;/strong&gt;This&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;lets you see what accounts you’ve blocked or muted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chvCaLd-B1A4RPA3CxGzHkbCFVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659852/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_10.00.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Interests from Twitter” tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Jnfnqh"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Interests and ad data. &lt;/strong&gt;Here’s a section you may spend a lot of time with, especially with “Interests from Twitter,” which tells you all the various interests that Twitter has matched to you based on your activity. If you plan on reviewing this thoroughly, put aside a few minutes: one of my Twitter accounts had 742 interests listed, including quite a few weird ones. As someone who has no interest in sports, I’d love to know how Twitter came up with “NBA videos” as an interest of mine. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="s8g5Hl"&gt;The other two categories here, “Inferred interests from partners” and “Tailored audiences,” can be disabled using the “Personalization and data” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KeiiPf"&gt;Finally, “Download archive” lets you download the archive of your account history and activity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WcYWPm"&gt;Want to be really safe? You may want to just bite the bullet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16991396/how-to-delete-twitter-history-tweetdelete"&gt;delete your Twitter history &lt;/a&gt;entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqgdcx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Democrats in Congress introduce decriminalization bill for all drugs, not just weed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wxzr_s-j2R91A_tv8T5YIJk018Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455390/acastro_200302_3922_SuperTuesday_capitol.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BBXv3t"&gt;US Reps. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-NJ) are introducing a bill today that would decriminalize not just cannabis but all drug possession, in favor of what they’re calling a “health-centered approach.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiyToO"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658765/dpra_summary_2021.06.11_v2.pdf"&gt;Drug Policy Reform Act (DRPA)&lt;/a&gt; would end criminal penalties for “personal use” drug possession at the federal level, expunge criminal records, and shift the regulatory authority from the attorney general to the secretary of Health and Human Services, “to emphasize that substance use is a health issue and not a criminal issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0oVvT"&gt;Under the act, people could still face fines for drug possession, but a court could waive the fine if the person is unable to pay. The act would require HHS to establish a commission on substance abuse, health, and safety to determine the “benchmark” amount for personal use drug possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH3Zin"&gt;It would also limit state and local governments from being able to receive funds under the Byrne and Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grant programs — both of which help fund state and local police departments — if they don’t adopt decriminalization policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAB52I"&gt;“Growing up in St. Louis, I saw the crack-cocaine epidemic rob my community of so many lives,” Bush said in a statement. “It’s time to put wellness and compassion ahead of trauma and punishment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2KBOwh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will Democrats keep their promise to decriminalize marijuana?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22243311/democrats-biden-marijuana-policy-reschedule-drug"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mxPx3Y"&gt;Under the DPRA, a criminal drug possession charge would not be grounds to deny someone employment or to terminate an employee. It also would prevent drug charges and convictions from being used as grounds to deny someone federal assistance benefits such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), and housing assistance. The act would restore voting rights to those previously convicted of drug possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsFcYN"&gt;The treatment piece of the bill requires the HHS to establish grant programs to support the expansion of treatment programs and connect people to services, including medication-assisted treatment, peer support and recovery services, and emergency response and crisis intervention programs that don’t involve police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YJoKBF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the War on Drugs stands as a stain on our national conscience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pR1tJb"&gt;The bill is being introduced just days before the anniversary of the war on drugs that &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/8/18089368/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth"&gt;President Richard Nixon launched&lt;/a&gt; in the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnC9Ms"&gt;“The United States has not simply failed in how we carried out the War on Drugs — the War on Drugs stands as a stain on our national conscience since its very inception,” Coleman said.  “As we work to solve this issue, it is essential that we change tactics in how we address drug use away from the failed punitive approach and towards a health-based and evidence-based approach.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7EbpI"&gt;To this point, most of the conversation about decriminalization of drugs has focused on marijuana, which is legal for recreational or medical use in dozens of states. But people convicted of prior marijuana-related crimes continue to languish in jails across the country, and half a million people are &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/22/four-in-ten-u-s-drug-arrests-in-2018-were-for-marijuana-offenses-mostly-possession/"&gt;arrested for marijuana possession&lt;/a&gt; annually in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZveDrN"&gt;Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has said that he and Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Cory Booker (D-NJ) are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260844/cannabis-legislation-congress-democrats-congress"&gt;working on cannabis reform legislation&lt;/a&gt;, saying in a February joint statement that lawmakers “must enact measures that will lift up people who were unfairly targeted in the War on Drugs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCjz1Z"&gt;And late last month, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-reintroduces-bill-decriminalize-cannabis-create-social-equity-programs-n1269017"&gt;Democrats reintroduced&lt;/a&gt; the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (MORE), which would eliminate criminal penalties and expunge prior cannabis possession charges, as well as create social equity programs. The MORE Act was introduced in the last Congress, but ended in the Senate which was Republican-controlled at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEESZi"&gt;But even though the Democrats included marijuana decriminalization in their 2020 platform, President Joe Biden was once a leading &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/5/8/18089368/war-on-drugs-marijuana-cocaine-heroin-meth"&gt;voice in the War on Drugs&lt;/a&gt;. He’s shifted his stance on the issue since, and said on the campaign trail that he would “reschedule cannabis as a Schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJDsXR"&gt;It’s been a tough uphill climb for federal marijuana reform legislation, even as the &lt;a href="https://norml.org/blog/2021/06/11/poll-92-percent-of-americans-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-under-certain-circumstances/"&gt;public largely supports legalizing&lt;/a&gt; it. How an even broader piece of legislation like DRPA may fare in the divided Congress (the bill doesn’t have a Senate sponsor yet) remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZOGQl"&gt;But Matt Sutton of the Drug Policy Alliance, which worked with Bush and Coleman on the bill, said DRPA marked a first step toward federal decriminalization and would not interfere with the cannabis-specific legislation Schumer has planned. “We will be building support for all drug decriminalization, which will end the more far-reaching harms of the drug war,” he said. “Specifically for people who use other drugs or have other drug convictions, and lead to a health-centered alternative approach to drugs in this country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sba4Ek"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAV9H2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOAhsZ"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luminar is using lidar to help build the ‘uncrashable car’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rj5urs"&gt;Austin Russell, the 26-year-old CEO of lidar maker Luminar, folds his lanky six-foot, four-inch frame into the back of a Toyota RAV4 and declares with giddy enthusiasm: “This is our first live demo!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMMya5"&gt;It may seem late in the game for a public demo, especially for a company that was founded in 2012 and recently went public via a $3.4 billion SPAC deal. There will be an even longer wait for those who want to see Luminar’s Iris lidar sensors in action: series production of Volvo vehicles with the company’s laser sensors embedded in the roof  is not scheduled to begin until late 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrdjrU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is our first live demo!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzBIwl"&gt;But on a rainy day in Manhattan, Russell is clearly excited to show off what Iris can do. He is in New York City for an event they’re calling “Studio Day” — a chance to show off not only the test vehicle we’re currently riding in, but also a few concepts of other lidar-powered vehicles, including a robotaxi and semi-trailer truck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bhAir"&gt;Lidar, a key ingredient in autonomous driving, is a laser sensor that uses near-infrared light to detect the shapes of objects. This helps autonomous vehicles “see” other road users like cars, pedestrians, and cyclists, all without the help of GPS or a network connection. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EMBARGO: June 15, 2021, 10:30am ET" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M1zTrS_saaw-65UnrBmAAzd7WYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658739/VRG05AH_210614_4634_001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luminar CEO Austin Russell says series production of the company’s Iris lidar will begin in late 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xHpCOA"&gt;As the RAV4 bumps along through midtown Manhattan, those shapes can be viewed on two flat-screen monitors attached to the back of the front seat headrests, amorphous blobs rendered in colorful hues of orange, yellow, blue, green, and purple. We see the outline of a man walking along the sidewalk, cars passing on the road, and approaching traffic lights. A few clicks on a mobile keyboard enhances the resolution and we can even see the door handles on the rows of parked cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JExg0"&gt;Existing active safety systems in cars, like pedestrian avoidance and blindspot detection, “are actually surprisingly bad,” Russell says. He believes that’s because automakers tend to favor testing their systems under unrealistically perfect conditions, like on sunny days with completely static objects. Cars that come equipped with Luminar’s lidar will be able to more reliably spot vulnerable road users and prevent crashes from ever occurring, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yt4dVu"&gt;“We’re actually moving towards the vision of zero collisions,” Russell adds, “building the uncrashable car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UhYPny"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 25-year-old billionaire building the future of self-driving cars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22298001/luminar-austin-russel-ceo-interview-self-driving-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rqDals"&gt;Luminar’s lidar uses unusually long waves of laser light, 1,550 nanometers versus the typical 905nm, which helps spot even small and low-reflective objects — dark-colored cars, animals, a child darting into the street — at a range beyond 250 meters, and up to 500 meters for larger, brighter objects. Russell said the lidar’s resolution amounts to “300 points per square degree,” but acknowledges that “there’s no good standard of measuring lidar resolutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leH6VO"&gt;To be sure, the RAV4 is being driven by a human and is not operating autonomously. The lidar perched on the roof of the vehicle is just to demonstrate Luminar’s sensing capabilities. And while Luminar also plans to sell the software that powers autonomous vehicles, the company is not ready to demonstrate that publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDsMph"&gt;What Luminar is ready to show off is its “blueprint” for how it will integrate its sensors into a variety of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles, which it is calling “Blade.” Gone are the days of the old “spinning Kentucky Fried Chicken buckets,” as an older version of lidar was once famously described. Luminar’s lidar sensors are smaller, sleeker, and — crucially for the viability of Luminar’s business — cheaper to manufacture.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EMBARGO: June 15, 2021, 10:30am ET" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSwktNiDNjAL9mxYKK3uuQjBNBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658744/VRG05AH_210614_4634_006.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luminar’s lidar is almost completely flush with the roof, a departure from the typically more bulky sensors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i0TmyJ"&gt;On the RAV4, the lidar was almost flush with the roof, with a strip of gleaming gold peaking out. The system incorporates a single laser and receiver. Luminar builds all of its own components and software in-house, including its eighth-generation ASIC chip controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efWrIT"&gt;Russell says Luminar plans to eventually sell its lidar to its customers for $1,000, with the goal of getting that number down to $500. This would represent a steep drop from many first-generation lidar sensors, which would typically sell for tens of thousands of dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lBHedf"&gt;The company is burning a lot of cash to get there: Luminar reported revenue of $5.3 million and a net loss of $75.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. The company says it hit a milestone during the quarter with the production of the first Iris lidars, and expects to hit the C-sample phase, the third level of prototype functionality, by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZGM2Yz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Luminar plans to eventually sell its lidar to its customers for $1,000, with the goal of getting that number down to $500&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xka5xx"&gt;When they’re finally ready to go into production, Luminar has secured commitments from a number of companies to purchase its lidars. In addition to Volvo, the company has struck deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16849422/toyota-self-driving-car-platform-3-lexus-lidar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/intel-mobileye-int/mobileye-looks-to-build-its-own-lidar-to-drive-down-self-driving-costs-idUSKBN28P2GW"&gt;Intel’s Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-30/daimler-isn-t-relying-solely-on-waymo-for-self-driving-trucks"&gt;Daimler trucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399389/luminar-airbus-lidar-aviation-evtol-partnership"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, and two Chinese companies: &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/18/saic-motor-to-use-luminar-sensors-in-high-tech-line-of-vehicles.html"&gt;automaker SAIC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22424726/pony-ai-luminar-lidar-robotaxi-california-china"&gt;AV operator Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;. Luminar may even have a partnership with Tesla, despite Elon Musk’s vocal derision of lidar as a “crutch” and a “fool’s errand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nKn3u"&gt;While those companies will determine how best to utilize Luminar’s sensors, the company has some ideas of its own. Passenger vehicles, like the ones Volvo plans to start producing in 2022, will have just one lidar mounted on the roof, right above the windshield, providing a 120-degree field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qXyKWoXxLdcRduM-PIjaGnH4S_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659743/Luminar_IRIS_Concepts_v2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Luminar&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luminar’s Blade concept for robotaxis and self-driving semi-trailer trucks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zoDeMZ"&gt;Robotaxis will need a wider field of vision, so they will likely have four lidars, which Luminar envisions embedded in a gold band that encircles the vehicle like a shimmering crown. Semi-trailer trucks can get by more of tiara-type setup, with one lidar facing outward and two mounted on either side to help with highway merging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7KHuY"&gt;“Any vehicle you’re going to design from the ground up for later this decade needs to start today,” Russell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQEwKX"&gt;As it relates to Tesla, Russell declined to specify the nature of the relationship with Musk’s company, citing “customer confidentiality.” He did note that Luminar sells its older Hydra lidar units to some customers doing “testing, development... data collection, [and] benchmarking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JmfPb0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Any vehicle you’re going to design from the ground up for later this decade needs to start today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1oXYq"&gt;For better or worse, Elon Musk has driven the conversation on automated driving. His aforementioned criticism of lidar has made it more difficult for Luminar to convince automakers that the laser sensor should be considered as a valuable component of the vehicle of the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy1ceA"&gt;“It casts a lot of doubt originally,” Russell says, “because you’re like, ‘Okay, well, this guy is right on a lot of things. Why wouldn’t it be right on something like this?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXdzhG"&gt;Russell calls Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems “best in class,” but argues that the company has “dug itself into a really deep hole” by erroneously calling its latest version of Autopilot “Full Self-Driving.” When the company inevitably falls short on delivering that promise of full autonomy, Tesla won’t be able to realistically retrofit every car it has ever sold with new hardware, like lidar. And the rest of the auto industry, which is less lidar-skeptical than Musk, could be well positioned to capitalize on Tesla’s mistake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSGa7B"&gt;“I think this is one of the few areas that other automakers have actually had an opportunity to leapfrog Tesla,” Russell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkziz1"&gt;Still, Russell calls himself the “chief autonomous industry skeptic” and agrees when I ask him whether anyone promising Level 5 capabilities — the ability to drive anywhere, under any circumstance — should be laughed out of the business. Autonomous vehicles are coming, just not as soon as was originally promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kc2YWe"&gt;“Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, Argo, Zoox, all those guys... the whole foundation of it is in robotaxis,” he says. “That’s the most challenging problem of the most challenging problem that humanity has ever faced.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75kUoh"&gt;That’s because the industry was operating under the assumption that lidar would always be prohibitively expensive, with companies needing to amortize the cost by ferrying passengers. Luminar is out to prove that the sensors can be produced cheaply enough to include in passenger vehicles. It will be an immense challenge, but Russell is convinced it’s possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onv0t4"&gt;“I think there’s going to be an evolution, not a revolution, to robotaxis,” he said, “and this represents that midpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea and Sonos announce picture frame speaker, coming July 15th for $199</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qLI_3aUmPjWnyf9s_BXqrwf6KzA=/87x0:1913x1217/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454922/speaker.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GzXkm0"&gt;Ikea and Sonos have today officially introduced the latest product in their Symfonisk line. It’s the $199 picture frame / wall art speaker that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; exclusively reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year and Ikea later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22464111/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak"&gt;prematurely posted on its website&lt;/a&gt;. The “picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker” will be available for purchase starting on July 15th. Though it’s very confusingly called a picture frame, you can’t customize it with your own images. It’s really just a piece of artwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW9CK2"&gt;The front art can be removed, revealing the speaker drivers underneath, and swapped out for other colors and designs. Several styles from artist Jennifer Idrizi will be available, but options will vary by market.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSLB38cHbjdUwhI-ELCngj2KzjE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659772/ikea.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESWmWb"&gt;The power cable can be routed out in several directions depending on where your nearest outlet is, and Ikea has also included an area for cord management on the back of the frame. The art speaker can also be placed on the floor with included feet; there’s a spot to tuck those away when not in use, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhvSCKJZwTukhVP9uFtweSda7PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659783/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_9.18.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cord management is built into the frame’s design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oDzdGw"&gt;Sonos said the challenge in designing this latest collaboration was to create room-filling sound in a product that will be placed differently than many of its more traditional speakers. But the depth of the picture frame helped there, and the company also built in a waveguide to direct audio all throughout a room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ziU_e0p9sSFI1HycnGd9HQZ9dgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659902/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_10.25.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A waveguide helps distribute sound throughout any room the picture frame speaker is in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TEXkqm"&gt;Two picture frame speakers can be stereo paired, and they can also be daisy chained for a cleaner look so that only one power cord needs to run to an outlet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mAHX9kUOsuwueHb0bTN7akZ1PzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659848/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_9.58.03_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The art print can be swapped for other styles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="omdV9d"&gt;Controls are located on the back of the frame’s left side, with the Ikea and Sonos icons used as a visual indicator of where to feel for them. You’ll be able to control the speaker with the Sonos app like any other device in the company’s multi-room audio ecosystem, and AirPlay 2 support is also included. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7H2GZC7StiyAaFn0rll7zFOlaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659887/controls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Buttons for controlling audio are located on the frame’s left side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="InRfqP"&gt;Only one new Symfonisk product was announced by the companies today, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reported that a redesigned table lamp speaker is also on the roadmap. An Ikea spokesperson confirmed that “a new lamp is part of our plans, and we will share more when the time is right.” All of these joint efforts are meant to more naturally fit in with a home’s interior.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIWTW1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor’s Note: On May 28th and 29th, 2021, we published &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/5/28/22456723/nomad-base-station-pro-qi-charger-pad-playstation-gift-card-deal-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22458509/memorial-day-deals-tech-apple-usb-c-charger-beats-headphones-among-us-deal-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;articles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; promoting a deal from Daily Steals for an Apple charger and cable for a discounted price. As it turns out, the chargers and cables Daily Steals is selling are apparently counterfeit and not genuine Apple products. If you purchased the cable and charger that were part of this deal, please contact &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:support@dailysteals.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;support@dailysteals.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; with your order number in the email to get a refund.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLvmf8"&gt;At Best Buy, several Smart Battery cases (as well as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743498379331524829#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a few iPhone 12 Mini cases&lt;/a&gt;) are steeply discounted and well below half off their usual cost for today only. The battery case that Apple made for the iPhone 7 fits the same dimensions of the iPhone SE (2020), and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743498288362573687#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $40 today&lt;/a&gt; (usually $100). If you have an iPhone XR, you likely already get great battery life, but you can make it even better by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743498259592878429#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;picking up that model’s battery case for $52&lt;/a&gt; today instead of $130. The only other options available today are for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743498239739196700#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743498218467323376#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, each of which is a bargain at $52, down from their usual $130 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HOHf5i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607518" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YXf0ui"&gt;It’s worth highlighting yesterday’s stunning discount on Amazon’s Echo Buds again. Prime members &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Buds/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can still get $40 off&lt;/a&gt; the original $120 cost of the latest generation of Echo Buds that have improved comfort, better design, USB-C charging, and more effective noise cancellation. This is a sneak peek of what’s to come with Prime Day, which is happening next week starting on Monday, June 21st, and going through the 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FoLgYH"&gt;Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/promotion/A3UBIBMMLCIRPP#" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting a “get three for the price of two” promo&lt;/a&gt;, where you can add three items to your cart to get the one of lesser value for free. If it’s video games that you’re after, the selection is decent — if you don’t mind getting physical copies. The best games that I saw in the mix include &lt;em&gt;Nier Replicant&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, &lt;em&gt;Hades &lt;/em&gt;for Switch, &lt;em&gt;Chivalry II&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, &lt;em&gt;Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 1 + 2&lt;/em&gt; for PS5, and the &lt;em&gt;Nioh 1+2&lt;/em&gt; bundle for PS5.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J0cp20"&gt;Also at Amazon is a big discount on 4K UHD Blu-ray and digital collection of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy.

(It says “Save an extra $10.98 when you apply this coupon.”) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Nintendo’s E3 2021 Direct showcase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dMQV-kRQCGG6dHlE_l8771xqus=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454333/botw2.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkVy8X"&gt;Nintendo’s Direct presentation is one of the last big happenings of E3 2021. It’s a 40-minute show that Nintendo says is focused exclusively on Switch games (and not new hardware, for everyone hoping for Switch Pro news). So, what will we see? It’s possible that the unnamed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"&gt;sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will make an appearance, as well as &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 3&lt;/em&gt;. Maybe &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt; will see its debut after being announced all the way back in 2017, then — in an unprecedented move — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;having its development restarted in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing it’s Nintendo, there will likely be several unexpected announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="59ojgT"&gt;When does Nintendo’s E3 2021 Direct begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ENyDfZ"&gt;This presentation will begin streaming on Tuesday, June 15th at 12PM ET / 9AM PT. Nintendo will have the spotlight, as Microsoft’s event happened Sunday, and Sony didn’t host its own dedicated E3 showing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a0fojM"&gt;Where can I watch the Nintendo Direct?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l00pTS"&gt;You’ll be able to watch the show on Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nintendo"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; page, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDzVlN"&gt;After the show wraps up, you can stay on either stream to watch three hours of Nintendo Treehouse Live, where the staff will demo some of the games announced during the Direct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nNNxDX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Affordable OnePlus N200 5G will go on sale on June 25th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX3nsFo4XjQnNWGV2rJggyLFCOw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454274/N200___Single___3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus N200 is one of the least expensive 5G phones to go on sale in the US.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IGkP4c"&gt;OnePlus has confirmed that the inexpensive Nord N200 5G will be available in the US and Canada starting on Friday, June 25th, for $239, making it one of the most affordable 5G phones in the US. With US wireless carriers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;demanding more 5G devices&lt;/a&gt;, the N200 will likely get a lot more company soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2d63e"&gt;OnePlus had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522711/oneplus-n200-5g-specs-screen-price"&gt;previously dropped a few other details&lt;/a&gt; about the upcoming device, like its 6.49-inch 1080p display with 90Hz refresh rate and big 5,000mAh battery. Other newly confirmed specs include a Snapdragon 480 5G chipset (also used by the freshly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22524766/motorola-moto-g-stylus-5g-price-specs-screen-launch"&gt;Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G&lt;/a&gt;), 4GB of RAM, 64GB of expandable built-in storage, and a rear triple camera with a 13-megapixel main camera. OnePlus doesn’t specify details for the other two rear-facing cameras, but the N100’s 2-megapixel macro and 2-megapixel depth sensor are likely candidates. There’s a 16-megapixel selfie camera around front, and the N200 offers 18W charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xpnuuoTTiNWQuXmMrfmXvG_sOGk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658769/N200___Combo___3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N200 5G features three rear-facing camera sensors, including a 13-megapixel main camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vC9ryr"&gt;The N200 5G becomes one of the least expensive 5G phones to go on sale in the US, coming in $40 cheaper than the similarly specced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; and $60 less than OnePlus’ own Nord N10 5G. It’s likely to gain more competition in the near future, too, as other manufacturers adopt &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22204586/qualcomm-snapdragon-480-5g-android-smartphone-price"&gt;low-cost 5G chipsets like the 480 5G&lt;/a&gt; and wireless carriers aim to put more 5G phones on their shelves (and more customers on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324345/verizon-c-band-5g-unlimited-plans"&gt;premium unlimited 5G plans&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>IRL is a new social network taking on Facebook groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jTqVce0X3FYQ2ZsB6wLuckidMW8=/125x82:1898x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69454282/web_and_mobile.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;IRL’s groups and events can be accessed on its app or website. | Image: IRL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D4hFvH"&gt;Do people want an app specifically for discovering events and messaging as a group? That’s the bet behind IRL, a young social network that has been quietly growing over the past year and just attracted an eye-popping amount of money to take on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3WkaA"&gt;The two-year-old startup is betting that a post-pandemic world will fuel its mission to help people “do more together,” usually by meeting up in real life — you know,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;IRL. The idea has attracted the deep pockets of the Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank, which is the biggest investor in a new $170 million round of funding that values IRL at roughly $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JNPUeW"&gt;That’s a remarkable amount of money for an app with roughly 12 million monthly users and no revenue. Even still, IRL is finding early traction primarily with people under the age of 18 in the United States, and the app has already facilitated more than 1 billion messages in barely a year. A handful of universities have now let students enter their school emails to gain access to virtual events and group chats. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lg26Ll6DtubRWKVPRtWuwMhgmtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659148/groups_matter.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: IRL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What a paid IRL group looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9Rcc"&gt;“We’re building Facebook groups and events for the generation that doesn’t use Facebook,” IRL CEO and co-founder Abraham Shafi told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There just happens to be no other product really focused on this space for the next generation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fAShAB"&gt;It’s true that Facebook’s users are getting older — look no further than Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/facebook-instagram-for-children-under-13"&gt;preparing an app for kids&lt;/a&gt; as a sign that the company is desperate to attract young people. And Shafi is right to identify groups as a critical area in social networking, as people are increasingly moving away from communicating primarily in public feeds to private chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9mItIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The combination of messaging and events creates the conditions for a platform”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gxx2sV"&gt;IRL is also starting to experiment with allowing groups to charge for access to for things like tutoring or music lessons, though it hasn’t rolled the feature out broadly. Eventually, it also plans to let brands promote events on its main discovery page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cihlye"&gt;According to Shafi, the goal is to become “a super messaging social network” over time. “We have the opportunity to build WeChat for the rest of the world,” he said in reference to the messaging app that over 1 billion people use in China to do everything from pay bills to hail taxis. “The combination of messaging and events creates the conditions for a platform,” said the venture capitalist Mike Maples, an IRL board member and investor who was also an early backer of Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9LYip"&gt;For now, the vast majority of IRL’s users are teenagers that live in middle America, but Shafi plans to use SoftBank’s money to help grow in other countries. Besides paying some creators on TikTok to promote their IRL chats early on, the startup hasn’t spent money on marketing. Instead, it’s finding new users in apps where young people are already spending time, like Snapchat, Roblox, and TikTok — the latter of which is also working on a product integration with IRL. (SoftBank’s only other known investment in the social media industry is ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2uo7Y"&gt;As part of this fundraiser, IRL is setting up a creator fund that will pay people to organize events in major cities using its app, like an outdoor movie night or a block party. Up to $100,000 in grant money will be earmarked for each city in the application program, which will start in the US this year and move to other countries sometime in 2022. The initiative is application only and IRL hasn’t specified the list of cities yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL926z0SxpBlZZMjxCMr3C4AAdg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659298/Abraham__11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;IRL CEO and co-founder Abraham Shafi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v3mKFN"&gt;Giving its young audience exposure to group chats with strangers opens up the potential for problems, and IRL will have to contend with moderating its growing network. The startup has already had to battle spam, and it's just now starting to ramp up hiring for its trust and safety team. It plans to give group moderators adjustable tools for proactively weeding out bad messages through Hive, an automated content moderation platform that Reddit also uses. Group chats that aren’t invite-only will be reviewed by IRL staff before they are promoted on the app’s explore page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="roe3jt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The pressure is to become a global phenomena as quickly as possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nec86f"&gt;Even with all the money it has raised, IRL faces tough odds against tech giant incumbents. Aside from the audio social app Clubhouse, which has already seen its growth stall as people emerge from pandemic lockdowns, only a small handful of social networks have managed to reach hundreds of millions of people since Snapchat debuted almost a decade ago. Unlike Clubhouse, IRL has yet to crack the top of the App Store’s free downloads chart, according to the research firm Apptopia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbaWuc"&gt;Thanks to its new fundraiser, IRL doesn’t need to make money in the near term, but it certainly needs to prove it can keep growing, according to Shafi. “The pressure is to become a global phenomena as quickly as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
