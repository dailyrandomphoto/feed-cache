    <title>Amazon delivery drivers have to consent to AI surveillance in their vans or lose their jobs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A driver of Amazon prime prepares for delivery in London..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rusE645bFOVQYeT-yEvx5X4fRrQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016516/1230412848.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f4w1V2"&gt;Amazon is well-known for its technological Taylorism: using digital sensors to monitor and control the activity of its workers in the name of efficiency. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;installing machine learning-powered surveillance cameras&lt;/a&gt; in its delivery vans earlier this year, the company is now telling employees: agree to be surveilled by AI or lose your job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dUVlc"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8n3j/amazon-delivery-drivers-forced-to-sign-biometric-consent-form-or-lose-job"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon delivery drivers in the US now have to sign “biometric consent” forms to continue working for the retailing giant. Exactly what information is being collected seems to vary based on what surveillance equipment has been installed in any given van, but Amazon’s privacy policy (embedded below) covers a wide range of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CESTHR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data includes vehicle location, speed, “potential traffic violations,” and more&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZsE8x"&gt;The data that drivers must consent to be collected includes photographs used to verify their identity; vehicle location and movements (including “miles driven, speed, acceleration, braking, turns, following distance”); “potential traffic violations” (like speeding, failure to stop at stop signs, and undone seatbelts); and “potentially risky driver behavior, such as distracted driving or drowsy driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XGQQri"&gt;
&lt;iframe src="https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/20521478-amazonprivacypolicyforvehiclecameratechnology/?embed=1&amp;amp;title=1" title="Amazon+Privacy+Policy+for+Vehicle+Camera+Technology (Hosted by DocumentCloud)" width="700" height="905" style="border: 1px solid #aaa;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IzH1e"&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s this last point that seems to be the most contentious. In February, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would start installing AI-powered cameras built by tech firm Netradyne in its delivery vans. These cameras record “100% of the time” and are supposed to identify dangerous behavior, like if a driver is yawning or checking their phone. The systems can then provide real-time feedback, telling a driver to take a break or keep their eyes on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sIBNq"&gt;This level of micro-management — and the potential for the AI systems to get it wrong — seems to have angered some drivers. One driver speaking to the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/global-tech-privacy-idUSL8N2KB4D5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thomson Reuters Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month said the cameras were an “invasion of privacy.” “We are out here working all day, trying our best already,” the driver, 22-year-old Henry Search, told the publication. “The cameras are just another way to control us.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ov2G"&gt;Other drivers have simply refused to sign, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy8n3j/amazon-delivery-drivers-forced-to-sign-biometric-consent-form-or-lose-job"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a heart-breaking conversation when someone tells you that you’re their favorite person they have ever worked for, but Amazon just micromanages them too much,” the owner of one Amazon delivery company told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JL1Ncl"&gt;When news of the cameras’ installation was announced earlier this year, Amazon defended the technology as a boon for safety. “We are investing in safety across our operations and recently started rolling out industry leading camera-based safety technology across our delivery fleet,” an Amazon spokesperson told&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFY6jD"&gt;Previously, Amazon’s deployment of this sort of technology has mostly focused on its &lt;a href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/02/amazon-wristband-surveillance-scientific-management"&gt;warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt;, where “pickers” have to fulfill orders while being timed by handheld scanners. The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16958918/amazon-patents-trackable-wristband-warehouse-employees"&gt;patented&lt;/a&gt; wristbands that even track workers’ hands in real-time, using haptic feedback to nudge them when they reach for an incorrect item. And it recently expanded its use of opt-in “gamification” techniques that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331502/amazon-warehouse-gamification-program-expand-fc-games"&gt;hustle workers&lt;/a&gt; into ever greater efforts in exchange for digital rewards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime adds features to make scooter-sharing less stressful</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwSltqQwz-s3Ierb6lqK6KbEc1I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016393/akrales_190321_3312_0048.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GAgdnj"&gt;Scooter-sharing giant Lime is updating its app to make renting one of the company’s battery-powered two-wheelers a little easier. Customers can now take advantage of new features like app-less riding, 10-minute reservations, and vehicle configurations to take some of the bite out of scooter-sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV2g8J"&gt;Customers who don’t have the Lime app on their phone can still ride by taking a photo of the scooter’s QR code and paying through Apple Pay or Google Pay. Lime says it will be a useful tool for first-time riders who don’t want to commit or don’t have space on their phones. The functionality works by temporarily downloading a portion of Lime’s normal app. It uses the Instant Apps feature on Android, while on iPhones it makes use of the new App Clips feature, which arrived last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21299924/ios-14-iphone-wwdc-2020-apple-home-screen-widgets-app-library-clips-pages-complexity"&gt;as part of iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v6wV7L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reservations could be a potential boon to anyone who has lost a scooter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tM5wPg"&gt;Reservations could be a potential boon to anyone who has thought to rent a nearby scooter, only to find it gone by the time they arrive at its purported location. After testing out the feature in a couple of key markets, Lime will now allow customers to reserve a scooter for 10 minutes in an effort to take some of the stress out of scooter riding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36YLuc"&gt;Lime will also start recommending certain vehicles to its customers. So when you open the app, the company will refer you to the nearest vehicle with the best battery range. Combined with the reservation feature, Lime thinks this will help customers secure their vehicle faster, estimating it will take “less than 5 seconds” to reserve a scooter after opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSzV1U"&gt;And finally, Lime’s app is getting a dark mode to help customers see their options better while riding at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLMm4J"&gt;Lime, which operates in 120 cities across five continents, is in growth mode as the weather warms up in certain key markets. In addition to adding new products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; and pouring money into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303364/lime-ebike-expansion-new-cities-50-million-investment"&gt;huge e-bike expansion&lt;/a&gt;, the company is said to be in talks to go public via a reverse merger. Lime says its customers took more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;200 million rides&lt;/a&gt; on its e-scooters and e-bikes last year, with the company expecting that number to grow significantly in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWedYP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 24th, 6:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added confirmation that app-less riding uses Instant Apps on Android and App Clips on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now buy a Tesla with bitcoin in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/THPKdKFi0ZYK8oI06_hzZbB1gy4=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69016323/msedge_NvDwkwZyth.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bitcoin payment option appears underneath the typical “Order With Card” button.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Tesla.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4TDBLq"&gt;Tesla now accepts bitcoin as payment for its cars in the US, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374617643446063105"&gt;CEO Elon Musk announced&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter. The option to pay using the cryptocurrency now appears on the company’s US website, where it’s available alongside the traditional card payment option. Musk said that the option to pay with bitcoin will be available to other countries “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJpkZd"&gt;As well as confirming the availability of the new payment option, Musk offered some details on how Tesla is handling the cryptocurrency. “Tesla is using only internal &amp;amp; open source software &amp;amp; operates Bitcoin nodes directly,” he said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619379929772034"&gt;followup tweet&lt;/a&gt;, “Bitcoin paid to Tesla will be retained as Bitcoin, not converted to fiat currency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bRcq0M"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pay by Bitcoin capability available outside US later this year&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1374619672973221892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PIMoMN"&gt;Tesla lays out how the bitcoin payment process &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/bitcoin"&gt;works in an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on its site, where it notes that users will have the option of scanning a QR code or copying and pasting its bitcoin wallet address to initiate the payment. It adds that trying to send any other form of cryptocurrency to its wallet means it “will not receive the transaction and it will likely result in a loss of funds for you.” According to Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/assets/pdf/btc_terms_and_conditions_en_US.pdf"&gt;bitcoin payment terms and conditions&lt;/a&gt;, its cars will continue to be priced in US dollars, and customers who choose to will pay the equivalent value in bitcoin. Tesla estimates that a $100 deposit paid today equals 0.00183659 BTC, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbuT8n"&gt;Tesla’s terms and conditions also caution that customers need to be careful when inputting both the bitcoin address and amount to be paid. It notes in all caps that “bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed” and “if you input the bitcoin address incorrectly, your bitcoin may be irretrievably lost or destroyed.” Customers are also responsible for directly paying all bitcoin transaction fees associated with their purchase, and Tesla warns that although bitcoin payments typically take less than an hour to complete, this can extend to up to “one day or more.” And because of bitcoin volatility, Tesla warns that the value of any refund made in bitcoin “might be significantly less” than the value of bitcoin relative to US dollars at the time of purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="56b3b3"&gt;Tesla announced its intention to start accepting bitcoin as payment &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;a little over a month ago&lt;/a&gt; in its annual 10-K report, when it said it would be adding the option in the “near future.” In the same filing, the company said it had also invested a total of $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency. The news sent the price of bitcoin up to over $43,000, an all-time high at the time. As of this writing, 1 bitcoin is now worth a little over $56,000.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card doesn’t actually discriminate against women, investigators say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eyajTf9Mg34jE82TN9RbZPYFaWc=/190x0:2227x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015404/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.46.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vH6eAT"&gt;Goldman Sachs’ credit card policies were called into question when Basecamp designer David Heinemeier Hansson and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak claimed that their female partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20958953/apple-credit-card-gender-discrimination-algorithms-black-box-investigation"&gt;received lower Apple Card credit limits&lt;/a&gt; simply for being women. But a recently concluded New York State Department of Financial Services &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392556/rpt_202103_apple_card_investigation.pdf"&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; has found Apple’s banking partner did not discriminate based on sex (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/goldman-didn-t-discriminate-with-apple-card-n-y-regulator-says"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1hOe2"&gt;NYSDFS investigators conducted a statistical analysis of almost 400,000 New York applicants that showed that the models and algorithms Goldman Sachs uses to filter applicants “did not consider prohibited characteristics of applicants and would not produce disparate impacts”. The regulator also stressed that the idea that spouses with shared finances would receive the same credit terms was a common misconception. Normal guidelines like credit history or unpaid debt were what determined whether or not a spouse received a higher limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zxrDDa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The same thing happened to us. I got 10x the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get to a human for a correction though. It's big tech in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Wozniak (@stevewoz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stevewoz/status/1193330241478901760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 10, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ESgPe"&gt;For each cardholder that complained, the NYSDFS was also able to acquire specific justifications from Goldman Sachs for each decision:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="EE5Szw"&gt;In each instance, the Bank was able to identify the factors that led to the credit decisions, such as credit score, indebtedness, income, credit utilization, missed payments, and other credit history elements. These decisions appeared to be consistent with the Bank’s credit policy, and none of the factors identified was an unlawful basis for a credit determination. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EBakWJ"&gt;Even without a case for sexual or marital discrimination, the NYSDFS was critical of Goldman Sachs’ response to its concerned customers. Technically, banks only have to disclose elements of their credit policy when they deny someone a line of credit, but the NYSDFS says that Goldman Sachs could have had a plan in place to deal with customer confusion and make it easier for them to appeal their credit limits. In the initial rush to launch the Apple Card, the bank had done neither. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm is reportedly developing a Switch-like Android gaming device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikfFenLqMUTOEmShlBnyFzRdLUo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69015226/acastro_180529_1777_qualcomm_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9h9d2E"&gt;Qualcomm is reportedly working on an Android-powered, handheld gaming console that’s similar to a Nintendo Switch, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/23/exclusive-qualcomm-is-planning-an-android-powered-nintendo-switch-knockoff/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374447139921686528?s=20"&gt;editor-in-chief Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;. The device would be powered by Qualcomm’s silicon, and could hit store shelves by next year — if it ends up being a real product at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWFYl7"&gt;According to the article, which cites images seen by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;, the device would feature detachable, Joy-Con-like controllers, an SD card slot, Android 12, and (of course) 5G. Also noted, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821"&gt;corroborated by Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, is a huge 6,000mAh battery. While the physical dimensions aren’t clear, Rahman tweeted that the screen could be 6.65-inches, with a resolution of at least 1080p (the Switch’s screen is 6.2-inches and runs at 720p). He also indicated that it could have a fan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueTznf"&gt;In other words, the device sounds like a big smartphone with attached controllers and active cooling, though that may not be a bad thing — the Switch kind of looks like a giant phone too. But it also has a library of great games that only it can play, which is its biggest draw. While there are plenty of good gaming experiences to be had on Android, from retro emulators to games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact, &lt;/em&gt;Qualcomm would have to give customers a reason why they should play those games on a separate device, rather than on their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered gaming phones&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;built-in buttons&lt;/a&gt; or controller accessories (or on their regular phones).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SD5rUT"&gt;Or at least, it will if it’s trying to sell the device to people — the &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; article indicates that Qualcomm does want it to be commercially available, potentially at carrier retail stores. It also says that the price target for the device is $300, the same as a full-sized Switch. Currently, the cheapest phone I found with Qualcomm’s flagship 888 processor, the Realme GT 5G, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22314043/realme-gt-5g-snapdragon-888-china-price-specs"&gt;costs roughly $430 (and is only sold in China).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0vi1Z"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1374448185377058821?s=20"&gt;Rahman notes&lt;/a&gt; that his source believed the product was closer to a reference design than something that would ever see store shelves. Chipmakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;including Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, often build sample devices to help other manufacturers design around their SOCs or radios. Sometimes, these reference products &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573577/intel-nuc-m15-laptop-news-specs-features-price"&gt;even end up being sold by other companies under different brands&lt;/a&gt;, known as whitelabeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="AfvwLA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s understandable why Qualcomm would be eying the handheld gaming market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg2LZl"&gt;It is worth noting that the disagreement between the sources could be due to uncertainty from Qualcomm itself — &lt;em&gt;AP &lt;/em&gt;believes this project is almost a year from being finished, so the company may not yet know for sure what it wants this to become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2F5l7"&gt;Whether the device ends up as a product or not (it could easily get canceled before it makes a public appearance), it seems like Qualcomm is actually designing and building a dedicated Android gaming device. It’s understandable why the company would be eying the handheld gaming market: it’s been heating up since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/31/4573596/nvidia-shield-review"&gt;Nvidia’s handheld Shield&lt;/a&gt; idea turned into the Nintendo Switch, with high-powered gaming phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Windows PCs with Switch-like form factors&lt;/a&gt;, and a variety of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;mods&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;classic handheld redesigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/1/18648304/playdate-hands-on-panic-keita-takahashi-bitsummit"&gt;novelty pocket gaming systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reveals flight zone for historic helicopter flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jHLT1Es8ZtTdVAwgoOit2wXA2zM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014614/ExLz6_3UcA8hKZB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jae2db"&gt;NASA has locked in a location on Mars for the first demo flight of its mini helicopter named Ingenuity, engineers announced on Tuesday. The four-pound rotorcraft is gearing up to attempt the first powered flight on another planet, demonstrating a new capability that could unlock access to hard-to-reach areas of other celestial bodies in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZxna8"&gt;Ingenuity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;arrived on Mars&lt;/a&gt; in February, clinging to the belly of the Perseverance rover, surviving a seven-month trek through deep space and an intense seven-minute landing sequence through Mars’ atmosphere. Within a few hours of Perseverance’s landing, engineers started analyzing orbital imagery to find a prime flight zone to drop off Ingenuity for its first flight — “an area where it is safe for the helicopter to take off, and also safe for the helicopter to land again after flight,” the craft’s chief pilot, Håvard Grip, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfMljm"&gt;The landing site, he said, needed to be flat and free of any large rocks that could threaten Ingenuity’s flight demos. But it also needed to have “texture” — distinct features on the ground that the helicopter’s AI-powered navigation camera can spot to track its whereabouts during flight. Soon after landing, “we began to realize that we might just have a really great airfield right in front of our noses,” Grip told reporters at a press briefing on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KipGjB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first flight is special — it’s by far the most important flight we plan to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d33fl0"&gt;Perseverance is in the middle of a days-long drive to the flight zone, just 196 feet away from the landing site. When it arrives, the craft will be lowered to the ground. Then Perseverance will spend roughly 25 hours driving about 330 feet away to a location NASA named the Van Zyl Overlook as a tribute to &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/418/jakob-van-zyl-1957-2020/"&gt;Jakob Van Zyl&lt;/a&gt;, a senior Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientist who died last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z9lpI"&gt;Dropping Ingenuity off in its flight zone is “a very prescribed and meticulous process,” said Farah Alibay, who leads Ingenuity’s integration with Perseverance. Ingenuity will need to be flipped from its current horizontal position on the rover to a vertical position before touching the ground, which will take “multiple days,” she said. “The most stressful day, at least for me, is gonna be that last day while we finally separate the helicopter and drop Ingenuity on the ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XPSO3ifiumfUyRTZYiWArJ0LPAk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392549/Mar_23_2021_16_55_33.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engineers test Ingenuity’s deployment from Perseverance using mock-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbH1Qt"&gt;Lockheed Martin designed the Mars Helicopter Delivery System that will help Ingenuity’s tiny landing legs set foot on the ground. Keeping that delivery system lightweight while secure was a huge challenge even for Lockheed, which has decades of experience designing space systems. “We had to toss all that heritage and knowledge aside and literally start from scratch with a new electrical connection design,” Jeremy Morrey, Lockheed’s top engineer for the deployment system, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWRDHL"&gt;Once on the ground, NASA engineers expect Ingenuity to conduct its first flight test no earlier than April 8th, give or take a few days depending on Mars’ weather. The helicopter’s flight zone is shaped like a mini running track, with a box-shaped takeoff and return area on one side of the zone. “The first flight is special — it’s by far the most important flight we plan to do,” Grip said, adding that a successful first flight will mean “complete mission success.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrfDeF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345034/nasa-mars-rover-perseverance-ingenuity-helicopter"&gt;For that debut flight&lt;/a&gt;, Ingenuity will climb nearly 10 feet (3 meters), hover in place for about 30 seconds, turn in midair, then descend for a landing. It will be fully autonomous, operating on commands sent by engineers back on Earth the day prior. A 0.5-megapixel navigation camera on Ingenuity’s underside will be snapping 30 photos per second of the ground to inform its movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtMkS"&gt;Ingenuity has another, more powerful camera with 13 megapixels facing the horizon. That will snap pictures in midair, while cameras aboard Perseverance will aim to capture the helicopter in flight. All of those pictures will eventually be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291412/nasa-perseverance-rover-first-images-landing-skycrane"&gt;transmitted&lt;/a&gt; back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ZOg_wFf3yrxP61DynM0XYdzf-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22392596/2_PIA23882_HelicopterBeautyShot2_120531___D2020_0129_RL2757.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The flight model of NASA’s Ingenuity Mars Helicopter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="haNlBC"&gt;Four more flight tests are planned in a month-long window after Ingenuity’s first 10-foot takeoff. What the helicopter does during those flight tests will largely depend on the results of the first one. “It could, in principle, go higher currently as designed,” Grip said. “There may be cases where, if everything goes well during our nominal flights, we might stretch things a little bit beyond the nominal flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDje3r"&gt;After that, Ingenuity’s test campaign will likely come to an end. It’s a demo mission, and Perseverance has other objectives to focus on, like collecting Martian soil samples for a future Mars mission to bring back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hjvQc"&gt;If successful, Ingenuity will mark the first powered flight on another world. A mission to Venus by the Soviet Union in the 1980s under its Vega program claimed the title for first off-world flight, with two balloon aerobots (not powered) flying into the clouds of Venus. Off-world helicopters like Ingenuity, if proven to be viable, could be used in future missions to trek places where wheeled rovers can’t reach, like caves, tunnels, or mountaintops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG7HTz"&gt;Even before Ingenuity’s first flight, engineers are already celebrating making it this far. Having a tiny, four-pound helicopter survive a trip from Earth to Mars is no easy task, said Morrey, the Lockheed engineer. “You have to survive launch on a rocket while carrying a carbon fiber feather. It’s never been done before,” he said of a mission like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge3CAH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1omnx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNFvyf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evJvNi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel invests $20 billion into new factories, will produce chips for other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbbYm9BW2d8T3Sci6WY-D-0rDNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014429/acastro_210120_1777_intel_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHsQSA"&gt;Intel has a new CEO, Pat Gelsinger, and he’s not wasting any time to make some big changes. At the company’s “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement today, Gelsinger announced plans to outsource more of Intel’s chip production to third-party foundries; a $20 billion investment into two new fabs in Arizona; and a new branch of the company called Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel’s foundries produce chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjyEy6"&gt;The announcements are part of a new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel’s design and manufacturing, which is made up of three parts. First, there’s Intel’s in-house manufacturing, which will continue to serve as a key part of Intel’s design and production of chips. Second, there’s an expanded use of external foundries, including TSMC, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, for production of “products at the core of Intel’s computing offerings” for both consumer and enterprise chips, starting in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nFYd5g"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A new “IDM 2.0” strategy for Intel&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WabTaD"&gt;And third, there’s the newly announced Intel Foundry Services, which will see Intel open its gates to handle manufacturing of chips for other commercial customers, led by &lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/biography/randhir-thakur/"&gt;Randhir Thakur&lt;/a&gt;. Intel Foundry Services is a “standalone foundry business unit,” and it will develop x86, Arm, and RISC-V core chips for external clients using Intel’s manufacturing technology. And crucially for government work, Intel’s foundries will be located in the US and Europe, a benefit that competitors like TSMC don’t have. Partners include IBM, Qualcomm, Microsoft, Google, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn23vc"&gt;The expansion of Intel’s manufacturing efforts — which include a $20 billion investment into new fabs in Arizona that will expand Intel’s existing Ocotillo campus — come at a critical time: the ongoing global semiconductor shortage means that demand for chips is at an all-time high. Adding Intel’s foundries (and its new Foundry Services business) could help open up new avenues for companies to source the chips that are essential for everything from new video game consoles to new pickup trucks. Gelsinger also teased that more foundries are in the works, promising additional announcements of expansions in the US, Europe, and elsewhere in the world later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff7Vt3"&gt;Intel also announced a new R&amp;amp;D collaboration with IBM “focused on creating next–generation logic and packaging technologies.” Details are slim at the moment, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFI1NR"&gt;Lastly, Intel announced plans to bring back a spiritual successor to its Intel Developer Forum conference with a new Intel Innovation event planned for October in San Francisco this fall as part of a new Intel On series of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fS24uV"&gt;Intel stands at a critical junction right now: the company faces increased competition from companies like AMD and Apple’s Arm-based M1 series of chips. At the same time, it’s seen major shifts in leadership and delays of generations of its chips, all while being outpaced by competitors like TSMC in terms of production techniques. Today’s announcements represent Gelsinger’s first big moves to try to right the ship. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon names former exec Adam Selipsky as the new head of AWS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At 2019 Dreamforce Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_fKTgOIGhVdxJVmh4mdEozBjQQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014323/1183490734.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ACSqlm"&gt;Amazon has named Salesforce executive Adam Selipsky as the replacement for Andy Jassy, the longtime chief of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the company’s next CEO when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;founder Jeff Bezos steps down later this year&lt;/a&gt;. Selipsky worked at AWS for more than 10 years, raising to the rank of vice president of sales and marketing, before running the startup Tableau, which is now part of Salesforce. Selipsky’s hiring was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/23/amazon-taps-former-executive-adam-selipsky-to-run-aws.html"&gt;first reported by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, which published a memo Jassy sent to Amazon employees on Wednesday announcing the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ra39a"&gt;“Adam brings strong judgment, customer obsession, team building, demand generation, and CEO experience to an already very strong AWS leadership team. And, having been in such a senior role at AWS for 11 years, he knows our culture and business well,” Jassy wrote in the memo. Selipsky joined Salesforce when the cloud computing giant acquired Tableau in a monstrous $15.7 billion deal in 2019. Selipsky has been part of Salesforce’s executive leadership team since as Tableau’s acting CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gjMCAD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meet Andy Jassy, Amazon’s next CEO","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="skUkn2"&gt;There was speculation as to whether Amazon would promote an existing AWS executive to take over Jassy’s role. Eyes were on Matt Garman, who was promoted to the top sales role last year, and Peter DeSantis, the general manager of AWS’s EC2 business, as potential candidates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqOguK"&gt;Ultimately, it looks like Jassy turned to a former colleague — and someone with a pretty stunning track record helping to push a midsized software company toward a $15 billion acquisition — as the top choice for his replacement to run AWS. Selipsky will rejoin Amazon in May, when he and Jassy will be “transitioning together” into their new roles in the lead-up to Bezos’ move to executive chairman of the board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJqZVZ"&gt;“With a $51B revenue run rate that’s growing 28% YoY (these were the Q4 2020 numbers we last publicly shared), it’s easy to forget that AWS is still in the very early stages of what’s possible,” Jassy wrote in the memo, referencing the less than 5 percent of global IT spend occurring in the cloud computing market. “We have a lot more to invent for customers, and we have a very strong leadership team and group of builders to go make it happen.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom now has an SDK for putting Zoom into other things</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user sits at a desk using a desktop computer. Emanating from the computer, connected with dotted lines, are a play icon, a picture of mountains, a map icon, and a weather icon." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hAQSsaUFWUR8yRl_RJOaV3sX_tk=/192x0:1629x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69014311/Video_SDK_Image.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjiSEC"&gt;Zoom has released a new SDK (software development kit) to help developers build Zoom into their software. According to the company, you can now build your own “video-based applications and websites” on top of Zoom’s platform and can more easily incorporate Zoom’s video and audio features directly into your apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxucl1"&gt;The company envisions developers utilizing Zoom’s chat functions in a number of different settings, from social media and gaming platforms to virtual retail apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8lnbH"&gt;“Using our Video SDK, developers can drive customer engagement and provide new opportunities for revenue without being tied to the Zoom Meetings user interface,” writes Zoom product marketing manager Natalie Mullin in a &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/bring-industry-leading-video-to-your-application-with-zooms-video-sdk/"&gt;company blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jw0h5J"&gt;The SDK is part of a broader push to get Zoom’s tools into developers’ hands. The company is also rolling out a &lt;a href="http://developers.zoom.us/"&gt;centralized portal&lt;/a&gt; where developers can learn about and access available developer tools. “We want to be able to have a single point where developers can go to learn about all of the tools and resources that are available for them in the Zoom platform for their work in development,” Zoom CTO Brendan Ittelson &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/22/zoom-introduces-new-sdk-to-help-developers-tap-into-video-services/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And there’s a new analytics dashboard where developers can monitor how their users are interacting with the new Zoom features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNHCf1"&gt;Zoom has had to significantly scale up its operations since COVID-19 led to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/2/21277006/zoom-q1-2021-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-work-from-home"&gt;increase in remote work&lt;/a&gt; and remote learning early last year. The company says it added an “unprecedented number of free participants” in the first few months of the pandemic alone. It’s consistently added new tools to keep pace with competitors like Google Meet, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300740/zoom-live-transcription-closed-captions-accessibility-free-accounts"&gt;expanded accessibility features&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273217/zoom-studio-special-effects-meeting-mustache-eyebrows-lips"&gt;facial effects&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570302/zoom-security-temporarily-shut-down-suspend-meetings-stop-zoombombers"&gt;security improvements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix will make you savor two of its reality shows with a weekly release schedule</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ei4fT0"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-circle-and-too-hot-to-handle-return-this-spring"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be experimenting with the release schedules of two reality TV shows, &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/circle-too-hot-to-handle-modified-release-netflix"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Instead of releasing all of the episodes at once, it will release them over the course of a month, with each show having a batch of episodes released on Wednesdays, then releasing the finale by itself at the end of the run. This means you won’t be able to binge all of the episodes in a single weekend... and that may be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mW3XY"&gt;These shows aren’t the first time Netflix has broken away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453220/netflix-arrested-development-return-television-landscape"&gt;the binge model it popularized&lt;/a&gt;, in which all of the episodes of a show are released at once. It has released episodes of cooking competition &lt;em&gt;The Great British Baking Show &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;music contest &lt;em&gt;Rhythm + Flow &lt;/em&gt;on a weekly basis. With&lt;em&gt; The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, though, Netflix is making a statement that it’s experimenting and trying to give people time to “dissect and dish” the events of the show. In other words, it’s giving people time to gossip about what happened and what could happen next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OXqKem"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dqaW6N"&gt;There is a benefit to having people talking about your show for a month, rather than only for a weekend. Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21039496/the-witchers-success-netflix-binge-watch-release-strategy-game-of-thrones-mandolorian-weekly"&gt;arguably ran into this problem with &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with the show’s writing seeming better suited to weekly viewing rather than an eight-hour marathon. That’s especially true for a reality show like &lt;em&gt;The Bachelor,&lt;/em&gt; with drama ratcheting up until a big finale. That’s the type of thing you’d want to keep people talking about — and maybe subscribing to your service to see what all the fuss is about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brcW0L"&gt;That’s the type of effect Netflix could be trying to replicate. Reality TV lends itself especially well to a slow burn, keeping the internet buzz alive. Imagine if &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; had been released over a month or two, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21203686/tiger-king-netflix-meme-tiktok-twitter-live-tv-coronavirus-viral"&gt;instead of all at once&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;em&gt;The Circle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt; probably won’t become cultural touchstones like &lt;em&gt;Tiger King &lt;/em&gt;did, there is a chance the release schedule will let them become bigger than they would’ve if we had all watched them over a weekend and then moved on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AymYXB"&gt;I’m not trying to say that Netflix will (or should) switch to the weekly release model for its future narrative shows. Yes, Disney was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188654/mandalorian-episodes-finale-release-time-spoilers-game-of-thrones"&gt;very successful using that model with&lt;em&gt; The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, but those shows also had a lot going for them, and Netflix has a history of successfully releasing narrative shows all at once: the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/2/21046412/netflix-witcher-henry-cavill-games-books-fandom-binge-ip-competitors"&gt;was still well-received&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;was an inescapable cultural force for a while there. It’s also worth noting that narrative shows and reality TV are very different formats, and it could make sense to have different release plans for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ukvslx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Circle &lt;/em&gt;is a game show about being isolated in an apartment and using only social media to connect with others (weirdly prescient for a show &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Circle_(British_TV_series)"&gt;that first aired in 2018&lt;/a&gt;), and it will start showing on April 14th, with the finale releasing on May 5th. It seems like Netflix is planning a similar release schedule for &lt;em&gt;Too Hot to Handle&lt;/em&gt;, a show where people try to date each other without any PDA, but the company hasn’t released exact details about it yet, other than a release window of “June.”&lt;/p&gt;
