    <title>The New York Times’ crossword can now haunt your living room in augmented reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A solved mini New York Times crossword overlaid on my couch, with a banner that says “Congrats! You solved the puzzle!” " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_p2lAuxKF5oT7D1Vy9eeSMO5M_w=/0x128:750x628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568928/NYTimes_Shattered_Crossword.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;I’ve done it.  | New York Times&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TBHXNe"&gt;A miniature &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; crossword can now float above your couch, courtesy of an augmented reality effect available on the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="http://instagram.com/nytimes/"&gt;Instagram page&lt;/a&gt;. Pull up the effect on your phone, and a prompt will appear saying, “The crossword has shattered into pieces!” A small crossword sits on whatever surface you’ve picked, while a cloud of letter shards hovers above it. As you move your camera around, the change in perspective will reveal the words that solve the puzzle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEJ1Xw"&gt;It uses the same principle of perspective, anamorphosis, that some artists play with to make  work that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/E-IXJkwics0"&gt;creates an optical illusion&lt;/a&gt; when viewed from a specific vantage point. It’s a neat concept, but it’s not exactly the same as actually solving a crossword. Fiddling with your phone camera doesn’t require quite as much intellectual rigor as the Sunday puzzle, but taking a guess at the word you need can help you hunt for the right shapes in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JTDe0E"&gt;The game is either fun or frustrating, depending on your tolerance for gimmicks. Some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff found it too finicky for their tastes. I, however, am a simple person of simple pleasures, and I derive satisfaction from watching little pieces click together and fall onto the crossword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qAbp19"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;please enjoy this clip of me desperately trying to find the right angle to arrange four letters &lt;a href="https://t.co/aQ7EMqjeDK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aQ7EMqjeDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— crisp distancing  (@crisp_red) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/crisp_red/status/1341483320086020096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFbror"&gt;It’s a gimmick that seems to hope the puzzler will be impressed with AR — which may not be the case for most crossword fans. But it did manage to pull me off the couch for a full minute (much to the confusion of my dog) while I tried to get the scattered fragments of the word “acts” to fall into place. You don’t &lt;em&gt;have to&lt;/em&gt; physically circle around — you can use two fingers to rotate the little cloud of shards and zoom in or out — but these days, I’ll use any excuse to stretch my legs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Apple refused a meeting to acquire Tesla </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beKsBOVlF4bEAhx7gzEvX7Zuzms=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568801/elon_musk_tesla_3225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9IUnSd"&gt;Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889"&gt;said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that he wanted to sell Tesla to Apple during the “darkest days” of the Model 3 rollout but that CEO Tim Cook “refused” to take the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDEJ8h"&gt;Musk dished about the proffer in response to a tweet about how Apple has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;reignited its desire to make and sell an electric, autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt;. He noted that Tesla was worth about one-tenth then what it is now, as the electric vehicle company rounds out a remarkable year where a meteoric stock price run turned it into the most valuable automaker on the planet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pq2LvF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;During the darkest days of the Model 3 program, I reached out to Tim Cook to discuss the possibility of Apple acquiring Tesla (for 1/10 of our current value). He refused to take the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1341485211209637889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L2NSEU"&gt;Musk has previously said that Tesla was “&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/elon-musk-tesla-death-bleeding-cash-a7928b06-3aae-43d7-bdde-5b9c41ef298f.html"&gt;single-digit weeks&lt;/a&gt;” away from collapse in 2017 as he directed all of the company’s resources toward ramping up production of the Model 3 sedan. Tesla ultimately survived, and has since gone on to roll out the Model Y SUV and announce new vehicles like the Cybertruck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpQq9K"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWr5h6"&gt;Apple has spent the last half-decade toying with an entry into the worlds of electric and self-driving cars, but up until this week was thought to be focused on developing software and other technologies that could be sold to other companies. But on Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194032/apple-car-self-driving-battery-tech"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the Silicon Valley giant has retrained its focus on making an electric, autonomous car for general consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4lMlA"&gt;One of the reasons Apple reportedly changed directions again is that it has made progress on a potential breakthrough with regards to the battery. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Apple has been developing a lithium iron phosphate battery that can be packaged more tightly in the car’s battery pack, cutting down on weight while increasing the potential energy density.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUokFl"&gt;Musk pointed out on Twitter on Tuesday that Tesla is already using iron phosphate batteries in some of the cars it’s making in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjfwqH"&gt;“Strange, if true,” he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4IuKM"&gt;Tesla and Apple have swapped a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of talent over the last decade. When rumors of an “Apple car” first emerged in 2015, Musk joked that Apple was a “Tesla graveyard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPidhK"&gt;“If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/8/9484379/elon-musk-blasts-apple-interview"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQ6B5"&gt;Musk said at the time that an electric car was “the next logical thing” for Cook and Apple to work on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0h7edm"&gt;“It’s good that Apple is moving and investing in this direction. But cars are very complex compared to phones or smartwatches,” Musk said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2u7sUN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this Wall Street Journal report on Amazon’s obsession with cloning and crushing its rivals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l0oVGcFWGbV_QhApKTPbeQ-Ta4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568770/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ex0Fvo"&gt;Amazon’s near-total e-commerce dominance is now the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;subject of regulatory scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-competition-shopify-wayfair-allbirds-antitrust-11608235127?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;new investigation from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;provides an excellent and exhaustive look at how far the tech giant has been willing to go to make its “everything store” live up to the name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viLIia"&gt;The story, “How Amazon Wins: By Steamrolling Rivals and Partners,” delves into Amazon’s various strategies for dealing with competitors and managing the Amazon Marketplace, its platform for third-party sellers that’s responsible for more than half of all its retail sales. Amazon Marketplace is now central to claims the company abuses its market power to squash rivals by cloning their inventory or features and using seller data to inform its own line of white-label products. Last month, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;European Union antitrust authority accused Amazon&lt;/a&gt; of unfairly competing with its own third-party sellers in Germany and France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPYWI5"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;story is a well-reported and accessibly explained highlight reel of Amazon’s more damning offenses, from its recent cloning of Silicon Valley darling Allbirds’ signature running shoe to the age-old and cutthroat tactics it deployed to dethrone Diapers.com owner Quidsi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZM5gd"&gt;The latter situation is a particularly telling story: Amazon slashed diaper prices to that point that it was losing as much as $7 on every box of diapers it sold, after which it reportedly approached one of Quidsi’s executives about a sale. The company sold itself to Amazon in 2010 for $500 million, and Amazon later shut down Diapers.com, signaling its complete domination of the online diaper-selling business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZTPHc"&gt;There’s a number of other anecdotes in the story about how Amazon would allegedly target sellers large and small that specialized in one or two popular items on the platform by labeling the competition as counterfeit. After demanding the seller provide info on their manufacturers to authenticate their account, Amazon would partner with those manufacturers to sell its own competing products.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmSjW9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s e-commerce dominance and treatment of online sellers has attracted antitrust scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Esco57"&gt;There are also anecdotes of companies fighting back and even winning, from Wayfair to West Elm-owner Williams Sonoma to Amazon’s fast-growing and most worrisome rival Shopify. In Shopify, a company that specializes in helping both online and offline merchants set up proper e-commerce operations, Amazon has apparently met its match, thanks in part to Shopify’s massive growth during the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEemNk"&gt;Shopify had aggregate sales of more than $5 billion on Black Friday, beating out Amazon Marketplace. That’s largely because of Shopify’s generously low fees for third-party sellers. Amazon has now reportedly created an internal team, as it has done to go after others, dedicated to replicating Shopify’s success, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewcUAr"&gt;More than anything, the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-competition-shopify-wayfair-allbirds-antitrust-11608235127?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, which anyone interested in Amazon’s rise and how it wields its market position should go read, is a helpful reminder that companies don’t become as big, powerful, and unprecedentedly wealthy as Amazon by accident or due to sheer momentum alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucd3a2"&gt;Oftentimes, key decisions from executives along the way help shape strategies that put other rival firms out of business or force those rivals to sell or face decline. In the case of Amazon Marketplace, those strategies may make the small businesses that rely on online platforms so dependent on one company’s services that they’re prevented from fleeing to a competitor. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will make Joe Biden’s @POTUS account start with zero followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President-Elect Biden Announces Climate And Energy Appointments" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4j0dv15QIpD4QXNU2d20VAqEFrk=/0x0:4461x2974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568163/1230220167.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joshua Roberts / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22XJ2G"&gt;President Biden is going to need some Twitter followers. Twitter plans to wipe out all followers from the @POTUS and @WhiteHouse accounts once Biden is sworn in on January 20th, rather than transferring the accounts’ existing followers over to the new administration, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Rob_Flaherty/status/1341406581901189120"&gt;according to Rob Flaherty&lt;/a&gt;, Biden’s digital director. The accounts for @FLOTUS and @PressSec are among around a dozen others that are set to be transferred to the new administration under the same policies, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-will-face-different-twitter-rules-when-he-leaves-office-11608642198?st=qipqi5w4hwb57f8&amp;amp;reflink=share_mobilewebshare"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4uztq"&gt;This is a reversal from what Twitter did in 2016 when the Trump administration took over accounts from the Obama administration. Back then, Twitter essentially duplicated the existing accounts, creating an archive of Obama-era tweets and followers and building a new set of accounts for the incoming administration that retained all of those followers without any of the tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CpbWbf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration will miss out on tens of millions of followers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Twitter hasn’t said why it’s changing the policy this time. Twitter told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it is “in ongoing discussions with the Biden transition team on a number of aspects related to White House account transfers.” Biden’s team seems to be unhappy about this change in policy, given the significant digital advantage they’ll be losing. Flaherty said the transition team “pushed back and we were told this was unequivocal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S903OI"&gt;While the president has plenty of pulpits to speak from, there’s no denying that Twitter is a major communications tool for the president after these last four years. Those accounts have significant followings to rebuild, too: @POTUS has 33 million followers, @WhiteHouse has 26 million, @FLOTUS has 16 million, and @PressSec has 6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhhCN0"&gt;Donald Trump’s @POTUS account will be renamed @POTUS45 and “frozen as-is,” the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. He’ll still be in control of @realDonaldTrump, albeit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21552606/trump-twitter-world-leader-public-interest-exception-ends-january-loss"&gt;with fewer protections&lt;/a&gt; than before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 has sold more than 13 million copies, despite launch disaster and refunds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFTk0dhUduWnc0_x91vMeU9sezI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68568159/Cyberpunk2077_Always_bring_a_gun_to_a_knife_fight_RGB_en.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vzOiIc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;has already sold more than 13 million copies since its launch two weeks ago, according to the parent company of developer CD Projekt Red. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZn0Zp"&gt;The sales milestone, revealed in an &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-67-2020/"&gt;investor note from CD Projekt S.A. on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, is a remarkable one considering it accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195420/gamestop-cyberpunk-2077-returns-even-if-opened"&gt;some digital and physical refunds&lt;/a&gt; resulting from the game’s messy launch. That metric is counting sales between the game’s release on December 10th through December 20th, the note says. It’s about half of the 12-month sales forecast analysts projected for the game shortly after launch but before digital storefronts said they would begin accepting refunds, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-22/cd-projekt-sells-net-13-million-cyberpunk-copies-after-refund?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9u00t0"&gt;Selling 13 million copies makes &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; one of the bestselling games of the year, though it still lags far behind the top 50 bestselling games of all time and CD Projekt Red’s last big hit, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&lt;/em&gt;, which has sold more than 28 million copies across all platforms. Still, few games ever sell more than 10 million copies, and to break into the top 50 of all time you need only sell more than 19 million copies (to beat out NES classic &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIAIW9"&gt;It’s likely &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; sales could soar far higher once the studio fixes more of its bugs and the game is rereleased on the PlayStation Store. Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled the game last week&lt;/a&gt; and began processing digital refunds for unsatisfied buyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlfeS3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;CD Projekt Red says that it has sold 13 million copies of Cyberpunk through digital and physical distribution channels as of December 20.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This number factors in refunds processed by this point at both retail / digital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The game had 8m pre-orders prior to launch. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZIg4j9nDeB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZIg4j9nDeB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Ahmad (@ZhugeEX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1341459372254359556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nIhu9P"&gt;The financial success of the roleplaying game stands in stark contrast with its public perception as a multifaceted failure, a fact that has only intensified criticism of CD Projekt Red and also raised the possibility of a class action lawsuit. That something can be that successful while also being considered a deeply compromised product is also a stunning indictment of the current video game industry and its marketing and preorder model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDiFdp"&gt;Because the studio promised the game would run well on current-generation consoles, it was able to accumulate more than 8 million preorders for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, effectively &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22170468/cyberpunk-2077-sales-revenue-cd-projekt"&gt;covering the costs&lt;/a&gt; of the game’s nearly decade-long development cycle in single-day sales. Meanwhile, the studio took efforts to allegedly hide the performance of the game on those systems from media outlets ahead of time, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/19/style/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-disaster.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciTPFv"&gt;Unlike other forms of media, which can often be easily assessed in a standardized format, video games require extensive first-hand experience on a variety of platforms for the full extent of a product’s overall quality to become clear. Without that knowledge ahead of time, millions of people purchased &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, only to discover its flaws later once players began posting clips online and assessing the game’s various bugs and performance issues on message boards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIFtBo"&gt;Hence the refund campaign, which was its own whirlwind of controversy after CD Projekt Red revealed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176279/cyberpunk-2077-performance-issues-refunds-microsoft-sony-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had not hammered out formal refund agreements&lt;/a&gt; with its retail partners before advising customers ask for their money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEF3WY"&gt;But if there’s any silver lining here, it’s that a project as huge and ambitious and, ultimately, over-hyped as &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;is now a teachable moment for customers and developers alike about treating major game releases with more skepticism and requiring more transparency around the quality of a product before placing a preorder. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook offered to license its network and code to avoid antitrust action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elpqpBnAy8HXGF3XTYLl5PhDsVU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567988/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hLrADP"&gt;In the wake of the groundbreaking Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/22/facebook-antitrust-lobbying-settlement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting&lt;/a&gt; new details of the company’s negotiations with regulators in the run-up to the case, including an unusual offer to license its code and network to competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIP75"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting, Facebook was willing to significantly alter its business practices in order to avoid litigation, including one measure “allow[ing] another firm or developer to license access to its powerful code — and its users’ intricate web of relationships — so that they could more easily create their own version of a social network.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIY6dX"&gt;Ultimately, the FTC declined Facebook’s offer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;filing an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; against the company on December 9th. The lawsuit alleges that Facebook used its platform power to stifle competitors, and it seeks to unwind the acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gxeDd"&gt;It’s not clear what a platform-licensing arrangement would look like in practice, but it’s a tantalizing proposition for some tech reformers, particularly thinkers like &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/assets/uploads/documents/Case_for_the_Digital_Platform_Act_Harold_Feld_2019.pdf"&gt;Harold Feld&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/08/tim-wu-interview-internet-classic-party-went-sour-attention-merchants"&gt;Tim Wu&lt;/a&gt; who have looked for ways to make it easier for users to switch platforms. This kind of licensing deal would allow upstarts like TikTok to buy access to many of Facebook’s most powerful tools — but it’s unclear whether it would produce meaningful competition for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YFOd9n"&gt;Facebook is also facing new scrutiny over an alleged deal with Google to coordinate ad networks. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-facebook-agreed-to-team-up-against-possible-antitrust-action-draft-lawsuit-says-11608612219"&gt;A new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday night expanded on details of an ad network arrangement between the two companies, as detailed in a case brought against Google by the Texas attorney general. According to the complaint, the arrangement guaranteed Facebook would win a particular percentage of bids on the company’s auction site, potentially constituting collusion between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49kqbU"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting, the deal was explicitly promoted by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg who told CEO Mark Zuckerberg the arrangement was “a big deal strategically.” Facebook executives were also given detailed and explicit instructions on how to avoid antitrust infractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tC0xlr"&gt;Both companies deny the allegation, although much of the state’s evidence has yet to be presented. “AG Paxton’s ad tech claims are inaccurate,” a Google representative told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We don’t manipulate the auction and Facebook’s participation in Open Bidding doesn’t prevent the company from participating in header bidding or any other similar auction.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Nicolas Cage shout expletives in History of Swear Words trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nicolas Cage reading a book about swearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEnD7reXexsS7Q87iF-FZ2oEwss=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567053/AAAABYWdj2lusZ4ZYb3V7kXS9jUgMKPh5ukTVTxnLgepEjDsv83xu1bkHhJ_lhD1C_2wymfEFHvL5j_7MN_x4bFGPglr7JA6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePzJM3"&gt;If you’ve ever wondered how profanity actually became profane, Nicolas Cage is here to help you out. The actor is &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zySHepF04c&amp;amp;t=45s"&gt;no stranger to swearing&lt;/a&gt;, but in Netflix’s upcoming show &lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words &lt;/em&gt;he’ll be doing it in a more educational way. Though, if the trailer’s indicative of what the show is going to be like, it’ll still be&lt;em&gt; very&lt;/em&gt; entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzUPZv"&gt;It opens with Cage standing up and just screaming “fuck,” likely a reference to him doing pretty much &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ve88BGz0nPc"&gt;the exact same thing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Deadfall&lt;/em&gt;. It only gets better from there, explaining the myth that the expletive is an acronym (standing for Fornication Under Consent of the King), and delving into how swear words are understood by the people using and hearing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N7g8Fg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The show will include celebrity interviews and, of course, a lot of swearing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLyUKd"&gt;As someone who’s always been interested in how regular words came to be (TED-Ed has a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWbu2Kh1S6Q&amp;amp;list=PLJicmE8fK0EjR_iVOzgiJfvRuDPqKlPQt"&gt;great series called &lt;em&gt;Mysteries of Vernacular&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;if that’s an interest you share), it’s exciting to see a bigger production that goes into the etymology and social implications of swearing. Especially since it seems like it will also be going into the backlash to swearing — the trailer includes a part talking about those Parental Advisory stickers from back when CDs were a thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyj8tl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only production Nicolas Cage has been involved with recently — if you can think back to the beginning of this decade-long year, you may remember Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;taking the internet by storm&lt;/a&gt;. Well, there’s going to be a scripted dramatized adaptation of it coming to Amazon, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amazon-lands-nicolas-cage-led-joe-exotic-drama"&gt;of course Cage will be playing Joe Exotic&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, it’s unclear when that will be coming out, but I don’t think it’s the kind of show that will fly under the radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4sZMN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;History of Swear Words&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;though&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; is coming to Netflix on January 5th. It &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/nicolas-cage-history-of-swear-words-netflix-1234849387/"&gt;will be six episodes long&lt;/a&gt; and include Cage interviewing various celebrities and etymologists (people who study words), including Open Mike Eagle, Nick Offerman, and Sarah Silverman. It will also, of course, include a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vk1zsl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original version of this story claimed that the trailer implied the word “fuck” is an acronym, when the scene is in fact debunking the myth. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘felony streaming’ measure is aimed at piracy services, not Twitch streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-HEARING-BANKING" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1NHKOnCEC6e4pejDMhXKMi2j7Y=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567803/1229890894.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by AL DRAGO/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gXrIH"&gt;Yes, Congress approved a new bill Monday that would classify illegal streaming as a felony offense, but the feds won’t be going after your favorite Twitch streamers, YouTubers, or their subscribers. They’re more interested in services dedicated to streaming pirated content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ir5jYQ"&gt;Monday night, Congress approved &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;an over $2 trillion government&lt;/a&gt; spending and coronavirus relief package that included a handful of controversial copyright and trademark measures. A felony streaming bill, authored by Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), was included as part of that massive package. The news circulated all across the internet; in a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/the-covid-19-stimulus-bill-would-make-illegal-streaming-a-felony"&gt;poorly headlined &lt;em&gt;Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;article, tweets, and YouTube videos. Quickly, content creators and their fans grew increasingly concerned that the bill could threaten their livelihoods or their favorite means of entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEn8JQ"&gt;But according to a press release from Tillis’ office and statements made by tech advocacy groups like Public Knowledge, streamers and their fans have no cause for alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79Uq7E"&gt;“As a general matter, we do not see the need for further criminal penalties for copyright infringement,” Meredith Rose, senior policy counsel at Public Knowledge, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/press-release/public-knowledge-responds-to-senator-tillis-felony-streaming-copyright-proposal/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. “However, this bill is narrowly tailored and avoids criminalizing users, who may do nothing more than click on a link, or upload a file. It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfmXR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It also does not criminalize streamers who may include unlicensed works as part of their streams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CafsyX"&gt;The text of the bill affirms this reading. On its fourth page, &lt;a href="https://www.tillis.senate.gov/2020/12/bipartisan-legislation-led-by-tillis-and-leahy-to-fight-illegal-streaming-by-criminal-organizations-to-be-signed-into-law"&gt;the bill outlines&lt;/a&gt; what would qualify as felony behavior under the law. Currently, streaming unlicensed content is a misdemeanor offense. Previously, organizations like the NFL would sue sites like NFLBite that recast games, but if approved, the Tillis measures would open the door for the FBI to pursue those website owners under threat of prison time. But while the penalties and enforcement are both stepping up, the bill wouldn’t change what’s legal and what’s not. More importantly, there’s nothing in the text of the bill that suggests platforms’ moderation of everyday copyright violations would need to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjiikh"&gt;Here’s &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/covid-relief-bill-still-includes-felony-streaming-act-1845929782"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from Tillis’ office describing the purpose of the legislation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FghP3u"&gt;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act will apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="fqIRyY"&gt;Still, it’s totally understandable that YouTubers and streamers would freak out about a bill whose final text was released only days before it was approved. Social video platforms haven’t done the best job in the past with copyright, Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) claims, and strikes. YouTube’s algorithm frequently flags content as violating copyright even when it doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/26/21037763/youtube-copyright-claim-studios-update-automatic-trim-tool-studios"&gt;For a long time&lt;/a&gt;, copyright owners like Universal were able to claim videos without expressly stating where the copyrighted material appeared in the content. Copyright is messy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iog8Af"&gt;On December 16th, Twitch addressed this proposal in its town hall, saying that the company did not expect the bill to affect its platform or its users. YouTube did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qy95f"&gt;That doesn’t mean copyright activists can rest easy. The multitrillion-dollar package did include a copyright measure that civil liberties activists fear could have dramatic consequences. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Tot32uXo3a?amp=1"&gt;The CASE Act&lt;/a&gt; was also approved in the package and would create a quasi-judicial copyright claims court within the Copyright Office. Copyright holders could be awarded up to $30,000 in damages if they find their creative work being shared online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um2tAb"&gt;There’s also more bad copyright news coming from Sen. Tillis in the next congressional term. The senator is planning to offer up additional copyright changes next year that have already spooked the tech and creative industries. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanBordelon/status/1341399864287096839?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday that Tillis has been circulating a draft proposal of a bill that would completely reform the DMCA. The bill would include a “&lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/01/notice-and-stay-down-really-filter-everything"&gt;notice-and-staydown&lt;/a&gt;” provision that could make copyright bots, like YouTube’s Content ID, stricter. &lt;em&gt;National Journal&lt;/em&gt; said that Tillis’ office would limit this provision to “complete or near-complete works” and would focus on larger enterprises rather than small platforms or creators. Still, current copyright-striking tech has been hit-or-miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlX3NZ"&gt;“This proposal [the incoming DMCA reform] would result in massive legal uncertainties for small businesses, startups and new creators; hurt competition and consumer choice for the next generation of platforms like TikTok and Parler; and lead to significant overblocking of everyday content on the platforms that Americans use every day to work, communicate and have fun,” said Joshua Lamel, executive director of the Re:Create Coalition, in a &lt;a href="https://www.recreatecoalition.org/press_release/recreate-statement-on-proposal-to-undo-the-dmca-would-fundamentally-end-online-creativity-as-we-know-it/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tuPIb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvCTCb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The stimulus bill will phase out ‘super’ greenhouse gases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker on a rooftop installing air conditioning at a hotel on Ocean Drive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PPF-Ih0B-K_JRFMOZMrCVA-zFM8=/0x0:3800x2533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68567675/814536358.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUnlYb"&gt;Congress’s $900 billion stimulus bill includes some unexpected climate provisions, including new restrictions that will change the way Americans cool their homes and refrigerate their groceries. The new measures will phase out hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) used in air conditioning and refrigeration, “super” greenhouse gases that are thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide in their climate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5wpg9"&gt;The goal of the provision is to cut the production and import of HFCs by 85 percent by 2035. Under the new provision, that goal will be federal policy and the EPA will have the power to implement new restrictions on manufacturers and importers in order to meet it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPpCXC"&gt;Those measures will bring the US in line with an important climate agreement that it had previously refused to ratify, the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol. With the US on board, the phasing out of HFCs is expected to help the world avoid an additional half a degree Celsius of warming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="L9qBBn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One of the most significant pieces of climate legislation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bN3IOu"&gt;Preventing half a degree of warming makes a huge difference for the planet’s future. The world has heated up by just over one degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, which has already led to more devastating &lt;a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/"&gt;hurricanes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2912/satellite-data-record-shows-climate-changes-impact-on-fires/"&gt;wildfires&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/climateandhealth/pubs/climatechangeandextremeheatevents.pdf"&gt;heat waves&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why policymakers and environmental groups have praised the relief package as one of the most important steps the US has taken to date in combating climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qihqj4"&gt;“This is one of the most significant pieces of climate legislation that Congress has passed in its history,” Andrew Steer, president and CEO of the nonprofit World Resources Institute, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.wri.org/news/2020/12/statement-congress-passes-major-stimulus-package-significant-provisions-climate-change"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Much more needs to be done, but this legislation should put wind in the sails of the incoming Biden-Harris administration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YpdhO"&gt;Rising temperatures have created a conundrum for city planners concerned about climate change. Recent urban development has happened alongside hotter weather, especially in the Global South — and that’s created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16290934/india-air-conditioner-cooler-design-climate-change-cept-symphony"&gt;greater reliance on air conditioning&lt;/a&gt;. More air conditioning has come with more planet-heating HFCs that add to the climate crisis. It’s a vicious cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtjFy4"&gt;“The need for more energy efficient air conditioning is so vital to the future of both emissions [and] the reality of what we’re building,” says Ian Hamilton, an associate professor at the University College London, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178481/buildings-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-united-nations-report"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;. “Those lovely, great big glassy towers in hot parts of the world rely so heavily on air conditioning for them to be comfortable, livable.” Hamilton was the lead coordinating author of a recently published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178481/buildings-greenhouse-gas-emissions-climate-change-united-nations-report"&gt;UN report&lt;/a&gt; that showed that emissions from buildings reached a record high in 2019, in part because of air conditioning units that suck up a lot of power and leak HFCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lmzp7x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a big deal for our economy and our planet.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HMBFQ"&gt;Luckily, there are &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/f-gas/alternatives_en"&gt;alternatives&lt;/a&gt; to HFCs that aren’t as bad for the planet. The industries that make these alternatives already employ 593,000 US workers, according to Senator Tom Carper (D-DE). The new mandate to phase out HFCs could create 150,000 more jobs in the US and increase American manufacturing by $39 billion over seven years, his office says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uv4gyr"&gt;“This is a big deal for our economy and our planet,” Carper said in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXjQFp"&gt;The relief package also includes about $35 billion for clean energy, including $4 billion in research and development funding for wind, solar, geothermal, and hydropower. There’s also $6 billion earmarked for emerging technologies that can draw down carbon dioxide emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KBmY4"&gt;Additionally, the bill will extend important tax credits for renewables and carbon capture technologies, including a tax credit for power plants and other polluting facilities that find ways to capture and store their planet-heating emissions. There’s similarly an extension of production and investment tax credits for solar and wind. President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill today.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Volvo’s first EV is an impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity and electric performance&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4rUWG8"&gt;There’s been an avalanche of new electric vehicles announced in the past year and a half, ranging from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429319/lucid-motors-air-electric-sedan-price-specs-range-reveal"&gt;luxurious&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502032/volkswagen-id4-electric-suv-first-drive-vw"&gt;practical&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;garish&lt;/a&gt;. So you’d be forgiven if you forgot about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20915841/volvo-xc40-recharge-electric-suv-specs-miles-range-reveal"&gt;Volvo XC40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, a great compact SUV with a terrible name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vizyM6"&gt;I won’t judge Volvo too harshly for its name choice. The Swedish automaker wanted to convey the simple message that this was a familiar vehicle with a new powertrain. And “XC40 Recharge” certainly gets that point across. That said, it’s an uninspiring name for what is arguably a fantastic EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rBLTxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;an uninspiring name for what is arguably a fantastic EV&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k0fzF4"&gt;I got a chance to drive Volvo’s first all-electric vehicle around northwestern New Jersey for around two hours on a recent Friday. The roads were freshly plowed, the sky was a cloudless blue, and the XC40 Recharge was an able and attractive partner for my jaunt through the snowy woods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8t3jfK"&gt;I already had an inkling of what to expect with the XC40 Recharge, having driven its sister EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;the Polestar 2&lt;/a&gt;, earlier in the year. Like the Polestar 2, the XC40 Recharge is built on Volvo’s Compact Modular Architecture (CMA), an advanced vehicle platform co-developed within the Geely Group, Volvo’s parent company, which already powers the plug-in hybrid version of the XC40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLK4EK"&gt;The XC40 Recharge also comes with Android Automotive, the native version of Google’s Android Auto operating system. This voice-activated system can control everything from navigation (“Hey Google, take me home”) to music (“Hey Google, play some Swedish death metal”) to heating and air conditioning (“Hey Google, turn on my seat warmer”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM0UczG6kXBbHHJvuKfz8WefiBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189074/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Q8E1sVY4FcdwuQorla8FoFVZdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189077/ahawkins_201221_4352_6480.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pm8wKL"&gt;Having already driven the Polestar 2, I was familiar with Android Automotive. But it was no less revelatory than the first time. There’s something immensely satisfying about using my voice to control all the in-car minutiae rather than fumble around on a touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIRKnF"&gt;It’s also uniquely tailored to running the infotainment system in an electric vehicle. When you ask Google to navigate you to a certain location, the Android-powered operating system will take into account your battery levels and incorporate charging stations that are available along the way. That should go a long way toward quelling any range anxiety you may have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="J7bCU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s something immensely satisfying about using my voice to control all the in-car minutiae&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9tg6bB"&gt;From the outside, the XC40 Recharge looks (surprise!) exactly like the gas-powered XC40, but with a smooth grille and no tailpipes. There are familiar touches, like the “Thor’s hammer” front headlights that are common across Volvo’s lineup. But the XC40 Recharge is delightfully nondescript. It looks like a typical Volvo with a few futuristic flourishes. I received no second glances from passersby and was able to blend into my environment, which typically isn’t the case with a new EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MM0Tz2"&gt;The XC40 Recharge has a key — a chunky-looking fob that fortunately is immediately made irrelevant because this is a car that can be turned on using only your phone. Once seated, you only need to close the door, press the brake pedal, and click the gear shift to the desired direction in order to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSVQfv"&gt;The 400-volt battery, made by South Korea’s LG Chem and located in the floor of the vehicle, has the capacity of 78kWh (75kWh of which is usable) — on par with other electric crossovers like the Tesla Model Y and the Volkswagen ID 4. But the XC40 Recharge will only get a little more than 200 miles of range per charge, which is significantly less than those other compact SUV EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhDPcX"&gt;I didn’t have enough time with the car to test out the range nor the charging experience, but Volvo says drivers can expect to get a lot of power pumped back into the battery thanks to the XC40 Recharge’s regenerative brakes, especially while using one-pedal driving. The battery charges to 80 percent of its capacity in 40 minutes on a DC fast-charger system, the automaker claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p9w564eEFNYSTiO75nBgXdsZcbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189079/ahawkins_201221_4352_6489.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r8-H4VurqgRLRYRDOHG87VHYqG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189078/ahawkins_201221_4352_6484.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hJlohv"&gt;It’s surprisingly sporty for a compact SUV. The two 150kW motors in the front and rear axle put out 402 horsepower, 486 foot-pounds, and 330 Newton-meters of torque, giving the XC40 Recharge that familiar zippiness down any straightaway. It will do 0 to 60mph in 4.7 seconds, a couple of tenths slower than the Polestar 2. I actually found the acceleration to be more impressive than the 333 hp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175017/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-first-drive-specs-review"&gt;Ford Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;, which I had the chance to drive only a few days prior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrwumH"&gt;What a world to live in, where an electric Volvo somehow feels more powerful than an EV named after Ford’s iconic pony car!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0cR43"&gt;Unlike the Mach-E, though, Volvo only has one driving mode, which speaks to the commitment to simplicity. If one-pedal driving isn’t to your liking, you can toggle through a couple of screens to turn it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xfUyfA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What a world to live in, where an electric Volvo somehow feels more powerful than an EV named after Ford’s iconic pony car!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd6YbT"&gt;Inside, the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster behind the steering wheel comes in three modes, including a minimalist “calm” mode with only crucial information, “navi” for full-screen maps and navigation, and “car centric” for help using the car’s driver assist function. The ability to view full-screen maps in the “navi” setting is a definite upgrade over previous Volvo vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UJzvMr"&gt;I appreciated Volvo’s decision to eschew the oversized main touchscreen in favor of a more modest 9.3-inch display. The screen is divided into four quadrants, or “tiles,” which is similar to other Volvos running the automaker’s Sensus operating system. The difference here is the XC40 Recharge’s display is powered internally by Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6BIgf"&gt;Again, shouts to Volvo for having the prescience to team up with Google for its first electric vehicles. The inclusion of Android Automotive gives the XC40 Recharge a definite advantage over other electric crossovers in its price range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D46pVKE1aNNTbAr4tMHTpc0lcXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22189082/ahawkins_201221_4352_6522.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orIXST"&gt;Not only is it easy to use, but it should reduce driver distraction as well. Being able to toggle between the directions, temperature, and Spotify while keeping my eyes on a road made me a better driver and reduced the likelihood that I’d swerve or let my attention wander. Smartphones and digital infotainment systems that invite a lot of scrolling or tapping are obvious distractions, and tech companies need to come up with better ways to mitigate that problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YMaiPC"&gt;It’s also demonstrably better than non-native Android Auto, which just mirrors your smartphone’s display on the main infotainment screen. &lt;a href="https://www.iamroadsmart.com/campaign-pages/end-customer-campaigns/infotainment"&gt;A recent study&lt;/a&gt; found that despite their simplified controls, drivers who are using Android Auto to select music are more distracted than drivers under the influence of marijuana or alcohol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eqtgl7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s an extension of Volvo’s reputation for safety&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vbySg"&gt;It’s an extension of Volvo’s reputation for safety, which encompasses other aspects of the XC40 Recharge’s design. The battery pack, for example, is encased in a neon orange aluminum case that Volvo is calling “a safety cage.” Embedded in the middle of the car’s body, the safety cage creates a built-in crumple zone around the battery. Leave it to Volvo to put as much thought into keeping passengers safe as it does its drivetrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymwEfe"&gt;Volvo kicked off production of the XC40 Recharge in October, almost a full year after the vehicle was first introduced, and customers will start taking delivery before the end of the year. Volvo’s suggested price is $53,990 (not including the $7,500 federal tax credit), which isn’t cheap, but feels right for the XC40 Recharge’s impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. &lt;/p&gt;
