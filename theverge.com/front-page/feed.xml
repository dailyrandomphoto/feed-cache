    <title>Twitter says it will fix disappearing tweets issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNHmZj9l6VBPYeh-5vdejuWCb2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895591/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KoYj7l"&gt;Twitter is planning to make some changes that could prevent tweets from disappearing while you are reading them, the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;on its support account Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB3MIx"&gt;Here’s what you might have run into. If you were looking at a tweet on your timeline, and at the same time someone else you follow replied to it, or the original tweeter threaded it, the app would suddenly refresh, while the tweet disappeared from view. That’s obviously not ideal, so Twitter plans to make changes over the next two months to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0rUwN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The background: a Tweet would move up the timeline as replies were added to the ongoing convo. Since some convos can evolve quickly, this made it so you didn't see the same Tweet repeated in the TL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our changes will keep your TL fresh and keep Tweets from disappearing mid-read.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766159486214159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyYRtn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440786174235213827"&gt;In a tweet replying to a user&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter put what it’s trying to fix more simply: “We want you to be able to stop and read a Tweet without it disappearing from view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0bgQo"&gt;The two-month timeline means that a fix won’t be in place immediately, though, so you might still run into the issue before Twitter makes the necessary changes. And while it’s not clear exactly what changes Twitter plans to make, the fixes could be welcome for people who have been affected by the disappearing tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdQHG9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s new G50 is a $300 5G phone with a big battery and two years of OS upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KxYIa3RB9oWPphcH1iu4V4w3Ic=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895204/Nokia_G50___Beauty_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a triple rear camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nokia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK3V8q"&gt;Nokia has a new midrange phone coming to the US and a number of global markets. The new G50 costs $299 and has all the ingredients to be competitive as a midrange phone, with a 6.82-inch HD+ display, big battery, audio jack and 18W fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOnRac"&gt;This G-series phone is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; that was announced back in April 2021, but the G50 has a bigger screen and battery and comes in a version specifically designed for the North American market (AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). Unsurprisingly, it supports the slower 5G Sub 6, which means this phone will work on T-Mobile’s 5G network, but not on Verizon’s mmWave network, and will only get 4G reception on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9lJF9"&gt;Like other 5G phones in the $300 range, the Nokia G50 is powered by the modest Snapdragon 480 chip, so don’t expect the fastest performance or smoothest gaming experience on this phone. It has 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot in case you need to backup your photos or sideload an app. Compared to Motorola’s identically named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;G50&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia has a slightly bigger HD+ 6.82-inch display that is capable of 450 nits of brightness and has a v-shaped notch around its front 8-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xulu-7vTpb5_FiBSErLXKOC0beI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870595/Nokia_G50_Emotional_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nokia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G50 comes in two colors, a blue and a pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2WTe5"&gt;On the back of the Nokia G50 is a triple-camera array, arranged in a circle. You’ll probably use the 48-megapixel standard camera the most, while the 5-megapixel Ultrawide and 2-megapixel depth sensor cameras can bring some fun perspectives to your shots but will likely be of noticeably lower quality. Its front selfie camera also offers video stabilization to help sharpen your blurry Tik Tok videos and a Night Selfie mode to brighten your low-light selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJBrqy"&gt;According to HMD Global, the maker of Nokia phones, the Nokia G50 will ship with Android 11 and receive two years of OS upgrades and three years of monthly security updates. In other words, this budget phone won’t turn into a brick in a few years, which is good for the environment and for consumers who want to get more use out of their phones before upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32jfJ0"&gt;The Nokia G50 is preloaded with Spotify and a 30-day trial of ExpressVPN and is available in Ocean Blue or Midnight Sun. It’s available for preorder starting today, September 22nd, at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FNokia.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F22%2F22687760%2Fnokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt; and will ship on September 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon collaborates with Billie Eilish on an Echo Studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Jy2s61mlmnaq0ia2idExoWds0o=/0x240:5760x4080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895066/Billie_Eilish_Limited_Edition_Echo_Studio_Lifestyle_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has revealed its new collaboration with singer Billie Eilish: a limited-edition Echo Studio speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cN4AmS"&gt;If you were in a tizzy about what to get the devoted Billie Eilish fan in your family for the holidays, Amazon might have just solved your problem — assuming you’re prepared to drop $230 on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ANSZ"&gt;Announced today, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Billie-Eilish-Limited-High-fidelity-speaker/dp/B0939S1B5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is available for pre-order and features the melancholy-voiced singer pasted on the side of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;highest-end Echo speaker, the Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the album cover art from Eilish’s new album “Happier Than Ever” has been printed onto a new beige-hued fabric and wrapped around the Echo Studio. It creates a slightly eerie-looking product that supposedly someone, somewhere, will want to put in their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSHR1"&gt;This is Amazon’s first foray into celebrity skins; previous attempts to dress up its bulbous smart speakers have focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;pandas and tigers&lt;/a&gt; designed for children’s rooms. The collaboration between Billie and the bassiest Echo seems like a direct play for the tweenager room — an assumption bolstered by the frilly boudoir featured in promotional pix for the collab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="637pvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Studio review: finally, an Echo that sounds great","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yXFeRb"&gt;The commercialism of this move may be a sad day for many Billie fans, who flock to the singer’s genre-defying music in part because of her ability to challenge the expectations that surround most young, female popstars. The songwriter is quoted in an Amazon&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-and-billie-eilish-announce-limited-edition-echo-studio"&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the device as saying, “I can’t wait for my cutie fans to be able to listen to my new album &lt;em&gt;Happier Than Ever&lt;/em&gt; in spatial audio, available on Amazon Music Unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klPBqXXWWcyW6wr2jN7DgwdT54g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870572/Billie_Eilish_Limited_Edition_Echo_Studio_Lifestyle_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Billie Eilish Echo Studio comes in a beige color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zjA9Xn"&gt;As a limited-edition device, the Billie Studio comes with a $30 price bump over the non-Billie version, which goes for $199. You do get six months of Amazon Music bundled with it — and that applies to existing subscribers as well — so you can listen happily to “Happier Than Ever” in spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgt3CG"&gt;There are no extra Billie features here, though, and no option to have her dulcet tones be your new Alexa voice. Amazon says that special Billie Eilish alarms are coming soon — although those will come to all Echo speakers, whether they have the singer’s face on them or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCe8Xx"&gt;Avid Echo Studio fans may have been hoping for an actual upgrade to the aging speaker. Despite being the only Echo that can output high-quality audio formats like HD or Ultra HD and spatial audio formats like Dolby Atmos, the Studio hasn’t seen a spec bump since its release in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcwpRp"&gt;For now, all we’re getting is a new look. We’ll have to wait and see if this is the start of a slew of celebrity-themed skins for Echo devices or a one-off collaboration. Top of our list would be Roy Kent wrapped around the soccer-ball-shaped Echo, complete with the rascally Brit as a celebrity voice for Alexa. Although, sadly, Siri probably has dibs on the likeness of the Ted Lasso star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15CKNx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jPxGX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:49PM ET September 22nd 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that all Echo devices will be able to use the special Billie Eilish alarms when they’re released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook names a new CTO with a major focus on hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfZdFmFSrLeIx_lh_Iaca21WOuo=/24x48:1200x832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895096/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Incoming CTO Andrew Bosworth wearing Facebook’s new smart glasses with Ray-Ban. | Photo: Facebook / Andrew Bosworth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqkdYE"&gt;Facebook is serious about being a long-term player in hardware. On Wednesday, the company promoted Andrew Bosworth, the current head of its hardware division that makes Oculus and other consumer devices, to the role of chief technology officer, replacing outgoing CTO Mike Schroepfer when he becomes a senior fellow next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O10AU3"&gt;In his new role, Bosworth, who goes by Boz, will continue to lead the hardware group, called Facebook Reality Labs, while also assuming responsibility for Facebook’s broader software engineering organization and artificial intelligence efforts. He’ll report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has taken a keen interest in developing AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;and the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dc2mPI"&gt;Facebook is still a relative newcomer to selling consumer hardware, and it faces steep skepticism from potential customers given its long litany of privacy scandals. Even still, the company has significantly ramped up its hardware efforts in recent years under Bosworth’s watch. His Reality Labs team already has over 10,000 employees, making it the largest after the engineering organization he’s subsuming that supports Facebook’s suite of apps and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ki0pHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSQ6Te"&gt;“As our next CTO, Boz will continue leading Facebook Reality Labs and overseeing our work in augmented reality, virtual reality and more, and as part of this transition, a few other groups will join Boz’s team as well,” Zuckerberg said &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/note-from-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I’m excited about the future of this work under Boz’s leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1VoHu"&gt;Schroepfer, who has been CTO since 2013, said in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/schrep/posts/10159715842464443"&gt;a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; that he plans to stay “deeply connected to the company, working on key initiatives including recruiting and developing technical talent.” He said stepping down next year will let him “dedicate more time to my family and my personal philanthropic efforts.” He notified Facebook that he was resigning on September 20th, according to a filing with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFjbmN"&gt;Facebook’s current hardware products include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684447/facebook-releases-portal-go-plus-video-calling-devices"&gt;Portal video chat device lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and its new camera-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;smart glasses with Ray-Ban&lt;/a&gt;. The company is, in addition, developing AR glasses with displays in them, which Zuckerberg thinks will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. A smartwatch with a detachable display and two cameras is also in the works for as soon as next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;I recently reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ7bJi"&gt;Bosworth is one of Facebook’s longest-serving executives, having joined the company over 15 years ago. Before running Reality Labs, he led its ads division and worked on the first versions of key Facebook features like the News Feed, Messenger, and Groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2cAIj"&gt;He’s an unusually public-facing Facebook executive who often engages with critics directly on Twitter. A close confidant of Zuckerberg, he has been met with blowback over the years for controversial comments, such as &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data#.upw3jdyR8"&gt;a 2016 internal memo&lt;/a&gt; that bluntly said connecting people was worth the cost, even if it led to someone dying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 15 builds in better customer support for in-app purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uzJIk2RCj3x6B9wJ7HInOt-S7a8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895058/acastro_210831_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqNtaO"&gt;As part of this week’s launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15, iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;, Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=1mmydqta&amp;amp;1632329842"&gt;also introduced StoreKit 2&lt;/a&gt;, a set of APIs for in-app purchases and subscriptions. The new Swift-based tools could help developers better track and support the purchases their users make instead of relying on third-party solutions like RevenueCat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlDZfh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/storekit/"&gt;The kit introduces new APIs&lt;/a&gt; to “determine product entitlements and eligibility for offers, quickly get a user’s history of in-app purchases, find out the latest status of a subscription with one simple check,” and most importantly, offer a way for users to manage subscriptions and request refunds in-app. Apple is also updating the App Store server API and App Store server notifications so developers can know when a user’s subscription expires in real time and possibly offer a free extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2ba86u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Better customer support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMVmx3"&gt;As RevenueCat notes in &lt;a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/blog/meet-storekit-2"&gt;a blog post breaking down Apple’s changes&lt;/a&gt;, StoreKit 2’s features only work when on devices running newer software like iOS 15. Apps that still support older versions of Apple’s OS — and most of them will for quite a while — &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/682105"&gt;are encouraged to use the original StoreKit&lt;/a&gt;. This divide could grow over time: Apple is allowing users &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;to stay on iOS 14 and just receive security updates&lt;/a&gt;, and given how long the company’s products last, there’s likely a lot of old iPads and iPhones kicking around. Luckily, StoreKit 2 and StoreKit are interoperable, “purchases made with the original StoreKit API will still be accessible through the new StoreKit 2 transaction and renewal info APIs,” Apple writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfvAi8"&gt;These changes could make it a lot easier to offer traditional customer support for the purchases made inside apps. For Apple, they’re another small enticement for developers to provide some kind of in-app purchase or subscription, which financially benefits the company thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;increasingly contentious 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC resurrects a decade-old rule as a guardrail on the health app explosion  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah7DKZLGQnkx4vNYbS3j7QRqBLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895010/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9XNotX"&gt;Health apps have to tell their users about any data breaches or risk a hefty fine, the Federal Trade Commission clarified in a &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1596364/statement_of_the_commission_on_breaches_by_health_apps_and_other_connected_devices.pdf"&gt;policy statement last week&lt;/a&gt;. The rule that requires that transparency is a decade old, but it hasn’t been enforced before. The new guidance serves as a warning to the many companies elbowing into the health app space: the FTC is taking issues around health data privacy seriously — even if it won’t be able to tackle all the privacy gaps on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxyBqy"&gt;The FTC’s Health Breach Notification Rule covers all organizations that aren’t subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which covers things like doctors and insurance companies. HIPAA requires those groups to disclose any time they have a data breach. The FTC rule covers any other group that deals in health information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhg4u5"&gt;Health apps often haven’t had strong data privacy protections, FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1596360/remarks_of_chair_lina_m_khan_regarding_health_breach_notification_rule_policy_statement.pdf"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; about the rule. Apps often have poor data protection systems, or &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/study-finds-serious-problems-with-privacy-in-mobile-health-apps/"&gt;violate their own&lt;/a&gt; privacy policies by sharing data with outside groups without telling users. These apps weren’t a piece of the digital health picture when the rule was first written. But since then, there’s been an explosion in health apps — &lt;a href="https://www.mobihealthnews.com/news/digital-health-apps-balloon-more-350000-available-market-according-iqvia-report"&gt;tens of thousands&lt;/a&gt; are released each year, and &lt;a href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252494669/Covid-19-has-led-to-a-25-increase-in-health-app-downloads-research-shows"&gt;downloads increased&lt;/a&gt; during the COVID-19 pandemic. More and more people are trusting their health information to these products. The new guidance clarifies that the Health Breach Notification Rule applies to these platforms as well, even if they didn’t think it covered them before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl6BIY"&gt;The breaches that could trigger a report don’t just include hacks or attacks. These organizations would have to disclose any information shared without users’ permission. That might apply to situations like the recent privacy breach by period tracking app Flo, which was sharing data to Facebook, Google, and marketing companies without users’ knowledge. The FTC didn’t cite Flo for breaking the Health Breach Notification Rule — it focused on &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/flo_health_complaint.pdf"&gt;false statements&lt;/a&gt; made by the company about its privacy policies — but two FTC members argued that &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1586018/20210112_final_joint_rcrks_statement_on_flo.pdf"&gt;it should have&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOr36E"&gt;The FTC’s new focus on making sure companies follow the rule could trigger internal changes at health apps, says David Simon, a research fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology, and Bioethics at Harvard Law School. “It’s going to force them to at least put systems in place, if they’re not already in place, to figure out when these breaches occur and then notify people,” Simon says. The rule says that groups have to report any data breaches that they &lt;em&gt;should have&lt;/em&gt; known about, not just that they &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know about — so they have to have ways to monitor data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cmoJjg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s in your best interest if you’re an app developer or a vendor of a connected platform that you pay attention to this rule”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wh9BaB"&gt;The penalties for breaking the rule are fairly significant: $43,792 per violation per day. “That can add up very quickly,” says Jennifer Wagner, an assistant professor of law, policy, and engineering at Pennsylvania State University. “I think they’re trying to signal that, ‘look, it’s in your best interest if you’re an app developer or a vendor of a connected platform that you pay attention to this rule, and that you have some kind of response mechanism in place.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CY0G0Z"&gt;The FTC’s rule will let users know when there’s a data breach, but it can’t solve all the data privacy issues around health apps. It doesn’t limit what companies are able to do with users’ data; it just says that they have to tell the users what they’re doing. “It’s a transparency kind of thing, but that has limitations,” Simon says. Some experts argue that users should have more active control over the ways apps can use and share data in the first place. The FTC doesn’t have the power to make those changes, though. “I don’t think it has the tools to do everything it would like to do,” Simon says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYtKc6"&gt;The FTC’s rule is also limited to digital health products that deal with health information. Lately, though, it’s been clear that platforms not specifically designed for health can actually be used for that purpose: a Facebook support group for breast cancer survivors, for example, might not be considered a health record, but it’s collecting information that could be used to learn about members’ health, Wagner says. If there was a data breach on that platform, it wouldn’t necessarily be subject to the rule. “What the FTC can do with the terminology is somewhat limited, although they’re certainly trying to do everything they can,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBX3wC"&gt;Despite the limitations, the guidance also comes as the larger landscape around data protection is shifting to give people more control around their information. There’s increasing attention from Congress, states, and attorneys general on data privacy, Wagner says. Companies are paying attention to all of it, and the FTC decision is a new piece of that puzzle. “They need to think about the steps they can take that are required, and to think ahead, because this regulatory space is not going to go away,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq14Un"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available in store at Best Buy tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/abKiM9j2UTrDrncw0JACGLW-WDs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894944/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZNp0N"&gt;For the most part, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have been sold exclusively online since their launch in late 2020, but that’s changing, at least a little bit, starting tomorrow. Best Buy will stock the next-gen consoles — specifically, the disc-based PS5, PS5 Digital Edition, and Xbox Series X — in several of its US stores, and getting one will be similar to the process the retailer uses for selling graphics cards in person. You’ll need to show up early and form a queue, then, at 7:30AM local time, Best Buy employees will hand out one ticket per customer for as many consoles as each store has in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aCLt3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fclp-video-games%2Fnext-gen-consoles-event%2Fpcmcat1632156747229.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1632156747229&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check Best Buy’s list of participating retailers to see if you should consider lining up early&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’re in the queue, you’ll be able to tell the folks at Best Buy which console you want to buy, and you’ll get a ticket for that specific console. Note that it’s one ticket per customer, and you’ll only be able to walk out with one console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6FCIW"&gt;Regardless of whether this kicks off more in-store opportunities to pick up a console or if it’s just one of the few chances you’ll have this year, this could be your moment to finally get one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas sued over terrible social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Former President Trump Joins TX Gov. Abbott At Unfinished Border Wall" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PcvxqLrVRuc_X1yKM6mLVtga5HA=/0x156:3578x2541/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894841/1326334178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wxsz2P"&gt;NetChoice and the Computer &amp;amp; Communications Industry Association (CCIA) have sued to stop Texas from enforcing HB 20, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661626/texas-social-media-law-hb-20-signed-greg-abbott"&gt;a new law barring large social media companies&lt;/a&gt; from banning users or removing content based on the “viewpoint” of the user. The tech industry groups’ suit comes two weeks after Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill, and it follows a lawsuit that successfully &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457200/ccia-netchoice-lawsuit-florida-social-media-law-unconstitutional"&gt;blocked a similar rule&lt;/a&gt; in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeViTa"&gt;HB 20 is one of multiple state-level efforts to make companies like Facebook and Twitter leery of moderating the accounts of conservative users. Texas lawmakers have positioned the bill as an anti-censorship provision, but NetChoice and the CCIA argue that it — like the Florida law before it — violates companies’ First Amendment rights to choose what speech they host.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2FB0J"&gt;“At bottom, HB 20 imposes impermissible content- and viewpoint-based classifications to compel a select few platforms to publish speech and speakers that violate the platforms’ policies — and to present that speech the same way the platforms present other speech that does not violate their policies,” &lt;a href="https://www.ccianet.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/CCIANetChoiceTexasSocialMediaLawsuit.pdf"&gt;the complaint says&lt;/a&gt;. “At a minimum, HB 20 would unconstitutionally require platforms like YouTube and Facebook to disseminate, for example, pro-Nazi speech, terrorist propaganda, foreign government disinformation, and medical misinformation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IVLM92"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The suit says HB 20 would make sites host ‘pro-Nazi speech, terrorist propaganda, ... and medical misinformation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BNwLyQ"&gt;The complaint objects to transparency provisions that would, in its words, require companies to “document in excruciating detail how they exercise their editorial discretion over potentially billions of pieces of content.” It argues that as a whole, the law infringes on web services’ right to free expression. It also calls the bill unconstitutionally vague, saying that terms like “viewpoint” could “encompass essentially all expression,” the ban on “censoring” content includes elements that could “encompass even the basic functions that Plaintiffs’ members use to present content,” and its definition of “social media platform” could cover services like the shopping site eBay or the gaming and “metaverse” platform &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6QekEi"&gt;Like other states’ laws, HB 20 may also be preempted by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a federal rule that would override conflicting state-level policies. Section 230 says that web services can’t be treated as the publisher or speaker of third-party content, and they generally can’t be prosecuted for removing “objectionable” content from their services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXyETV"&gt;In a call with reporters, NetChoice president and CEO Steve DelBianco clarified that the plaintiffs aren’t immediately challenging a portion of the rule barring “censorship” on email services because they’re targeting what they see as the most immediately vulnerable sections of the law. But CCIA president Matt Schruers says they will go after that provision if necessary. “The Texas legislature is trying to legislate more spam into your inbox, and I don’t see the value of that,” says Schruers. “Nobody wants any more spam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7eNwh"&gt;A federal judge was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;highly unsympathetic&lt;/a&gt; to Florida’s social media law earlier this year, awarding NetChoice and the CCIA a preliminary injunction against it and calling it likely unconstitutional. The Texas law won’t raise all the same issues as the Florida one — for instance, it doesn’t include Florida’s infamous exception for companies with theme parks. But the two rules have a lot in common, and &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/attorney-general-paxton-leads-10-state-coalition-regulate-big-tech-censorship"&gt;Texas (alongside nine other states) submitted&lt;/a&gt; a brief supporting Florida in its case, saying an unfavorable ruling could potentially “imperil” similar laws like HB 20.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord starts testing YouTube integration weeks after Google shuts down music bots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FRhV_mehDPmQbIRM8S0SwOau7Yw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894750/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9XiKy"&gt;Discord is starting to test YouTube integration, just weeks after Google-owned YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;forced two popular Discord music bots offline&lt;/a&gt;. YouTube integration has started appearing in a small number of Discord servers today as part of what appears to be a new test of a collaboration between Discord and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EhvSS"&gt;The feature is called Watch Together, and as the name implies, it allows Discord members to watch YouTube videos together. A test of a similar Discord feature &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/jtnso2/social_party_games_on_discord/"&gt;started 10 months ago&lt;/a&gt; before disappearing and resurfacing as Watch Together today, and we understand the company has re-prioritized this particular feature due to the recent music bot shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MayWlMVw-gKQplzfV_ifr2UAej4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869385/discordwatchtogether.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new Watch Together feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SGfKJu"&gt;Watch Together is very similar to the experience of someone broadcasting their screen in Discord, and the button to launch it even appears alongside the video and screen sharing options. It’s designed specifically with YouTube in mind, allowing Discord server members to create a playlist of YouTube videos by searching or pasting in YouTube links. You can even toggle a remote button that lets other Discord server members share the ability to control playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi2Pa4"&gt;While it’s not identical to the popular Rythm and Groovy Discord music bots, you can use Watch Together to listen to music through YouTube in Discord. You may end up hearing or seeing ads, though. Discord warns, when you first use the Watch Together feature, that “you may see ads during YouTube videos.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfAIIX3CAO2vnVHBRy3cZYO373k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870709/discordyoutube.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s YouTube ads warning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R6i2t9"&gt;The addition of ads and potential revenue opportunity for Google-owned YouTube comes just weeks after YouTube began aggressively shutting down Discord music bots. The Google-owned company sent a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"&gt;legal cease and desist letter to Groovy Bot&lt;/a&gt; last month, forcing the popular service offline within days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22669502/youtube-discord-rythm-music-bot-closure"&gt;YouTube then turned its attention to the most popular Discord music bot&lt;/a&gt;, Rythm, and it ceased working earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxnRQH"&gt;We understand that this is only rolling out to Discord friends and family servers today, followed by a wider beta to small servers and then broader availability in the next few weeks. Discord is tentatively aiming to launch it to all users by the end of October. If you’re interested in testing the feature, it’s currently live in &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/discordgameslab"&gt;Discord’s Game Labs server&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIpVm5"&gt;We reached out to both Discord and Google to comment on the new YouTube integration, but Discord declined to comment. Google did not respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkthpV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 22nd 4:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with information about the ads experience in Watch Together.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests video downloads for your desktop browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6P8Gezby4-eqIFQ2P1mRl5h1O2U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69894383/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lsg7EP"&gt;YouTube is testing an official way to download videos on your desktop web browser (&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/09/22/youtube-gets-official-video-downloads-on-the-web-saving-you-from-using-some-very-sketchy-sites/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you want to see if you’re eligible for the test, which runs through October 19th, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;check out YouTube’s experimental features page&lt;/a&gt;, which lists tests available for Premium subscribers. I was able to opt in to the test, but a colleague of mine wasn’t, which seems to indicate that not everyone is able to try the feature just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy3wOj"&gt;If you’re opted-in and on a supported browser (“the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, or Opera,” according to Google), when you’re watching a video, you should see an option to download the video under the player. When you click it, YouTube will download the video, which you can then watch from the Downloads section that’s accessible from the hamburger menu on the left side of the screen. I can’t find a way to download videos and watch them outside of my browser — this seems to be more of a way to watch YouTube videos offline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
