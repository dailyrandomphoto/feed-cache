    <title>Public transportation can save the world — if we let it</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUnrldP51S4k4kr2It-A5k2g3nU=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073720/kmcclellan_211008_4786_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n9fCQq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIpttW"&gt;Caleb Spronk, 35, has a lot of great memories — and some not-so-great ones, too — of riding public transportation in Minneapolis. There were the random conversations with strangers, late-night rides after last call at the bar, and those raucous times packed onto a Metro Transit train with dozens of other Twins fans after a big win at Target Field. Even the time he was slapped in the face by a teenager who didn’t take kindly to Spronk’s request to stop holding the doors open wasn’t enough to taint the overall experience of riding transit in the Twin Cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V7Xz4"&gt;Then Covid hit, and Spronk, like many people, stopped using the train. As a software developer, he was privileged to be able to work from home. But when he eventually returns to the office — which he assumes he will at some point — Spronk said he may just end up walking rather than using public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Alp6"&gt;“​​I’m not afraid,” he said, “I regretfully just don’t need to use it anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADNtBw"&gt;Spronk isn’t alone. Nationally, &lt;a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/APTA-COVID-19-Funding-Impact-2021-01-27.pdf"&gt;transit ridership fell by 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. Those numbers have improved but are still below pre-pandemic levels, despite the widespread availability of vaccines and the loosening of state restrictions. There is a growing fear in the transit community: what if riders don’t come back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChRA9O"&gt;With government budgets strained as a result of the pandemic, experts worry that transit could be on the chopping block based on the historical reasoning that fewer riders means fewer dollars will be needed. That could create something called a “death spiral” — a cycle of terrible service leading to even fewer riders, leading to even more terrible service, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="UVnWhf"&gt;There’s more at stake than good buses and trains. The recent report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that a hotter, wetter, more inhospitable future is all but certain. The transportation sector is responsible for nearly a third of greenhouse gases, most of which come from tailpipe emissions. High-quality mass transit can do a lot to fight climate change, but only if people are willing to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqTrGV"&gt;Cleaner air, a cooler Earth, more vibrant and diverse cities — these are the things that reliable public transportation can give us. The question is not whether public transportation can survive Covid; it’s whether we can survive without public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYNsia"&gt;The emergence of the Delta variant has cast a shadow over transit’s planned comeback. Bus ridership has recovered to 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, while rail ridership has recovered to only 40 percent. As hospital beds filled up in some states over the summer, many employers delayed their office re-openings until 2022. Experts predict it may take many months, if not years, for ridership to return to normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwUEan"&gt;There is a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Congress approved $70 billion in funding for public transportation as part of the two emergency stimulus packages, more than 300 percent of transit’s average annual federal appropriations. Public transit agencies could get even more funding, depending on how the precarious negotiations over President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan shake out. That plan includes $39 billion for public transit systems through 2026, a historic infusion of cash will help many transit systems stay afloat, maybe even expand and improve, but it’s not a permanent solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5siaii"&gt;There will always be people who use transit because of its convenience, it’s affordability, and its reliability. But what happens when transit loses riders like Spronk, a rider by choice, who prior to the pandemic was a daily user? Now, Spronk says he’s left with his memories, some of which include using superior train systems in Europe and Asia while traveling abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTqF3z"&gt;“I just know we’re going to get further and further away from that type of system,” Spronk said, “if we don’t start prioritizing mass transit systems more than we currently do.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="cC1LSe"&gt;As Andy Byford, former president of the New York City Transit Authority, current president of Transport for London, and the man affectionately called “Train Daddy” by his fans (yes, a transit administrator has honest-to-god fans), likes to say, “running a transit system is like Groundhog Day; each day is the same, but it should be better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuLwn8"&gt;The pandemic has upended that ethos. Each day, transit leaders are waking up to new headaches. Right now, they are facing the impossible task of keeping revenues afloat in the face of historic rider shortages while also maintaining service for the riders who never left and trying to convince those who did that it’s safe to come back. Tomorrow, the challenge will be how to protect against rising sea levels, deadly heat waves, and other climate change-related disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bBN3u"&gt;In interviews with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, transit leaders tried to sound optimistic in the face of these compounding challenges. Delta already scrambled a lot of comeback plans, but a lot depends on where you live. Texas is being hit harder than California, for example, which is why Bob Powers, general manager of the Bay Area Rapid Transit, said the numbers he was seeing regarding ridership were “encouraging,” while Thomas Lambert, who runs Houston’s Metro system, was less cheerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul0v8L"&gt;“I don’t know the answer, to be very candid with you,” Lambert said when asked how the pandemic will affect Houston’s ridership long-term. “We were on a different path, probably a couple of months ago, when we saw a decline in the number of positive [Covid] cases. In the last couple of months, we’ve seen those numbers go up a lot,” he said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03S20Q"&gt;“There was a plan, probably going back to May and June, that we were going to see more employers bringing employees back in September,” he continued. “Now we’re seeing them rethink that. So I’m not really sure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWm2UV"&gt;Case numbers are decreasing across the country, and there is hope that we’re already through the worst of the pandemic, but the virus isn’t done with us yet. And there are questions of what will happen as the weather gets colder and people start to let their guard down again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGSJoK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="gMH344"&gt;Lambert and other agency leaders expressed bewilderment as to what will come next. They want to lay more track, improve bus routes, and introduce innovations, like tap-to-pay fare payments and other high-tech ideas. But they also need to cover their operating expenses and make up for the drop in revenue at the farebox. If there is indeed a once-in-a-generation opportunity to be seized, there is also confusion as to how to go about the actual seizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1prqGr"&gt;Transit leaders will also need to resist the urge to outsource services to tech startups promising salvation, experts say. For the past decade, tech companies have been aggressively lobbying local governments looking for subsidies or relaxed rules for services that seek to compete with or undermine transit. Ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft, autonomous vehicle companies, and even air taxi startups will publicly say they want to compliment and improve transit, but what they really want is more people using single-occupancy vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNxDfp"&gt;Buzzy projects like “mobility-as-a-service” (MaaS) are gaining traction in a few cities. Pittsburgh, which has long been a hub for autonomous vehicle testing thanks to Carnegie Mellon University, has recently embarked on an experiment to integrate multiple transportation services, like public transportation, car share, electric scooters, and ride-hailing, into a single smartphone app in the hopes of making it easier for users to get around without a car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPAWKs"&gt;“We’re making it super intuitive to open up a single app, with everything in one place,” Karina Ricks, director of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/pittsburgh-borrows-a-mobility-concept-from-finland"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CityLab &lt;/em&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxVrC8"&gt;It’s still early days for MaaS. It won’t be clear whether it’s working in Pittsburgh for at least a decade, as city officials have said their goal is to halve tailpipe emissions and vehicle miles traveled by 2030. The key to their success? Frequent, reliable public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf9KTR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="VwxuwN"&gt;Bigger questions remain about how public transportation needs to work in order to meet current and future demands, with experts and academics arguing that the whole design is out-of-whack and needs to be rethought. Most public transportation is built around a hub-and-spoke model, bringing people who live in the suburbs into the city for work or shopping. That system has waned in relevance over several decades as suburban office parks cropped up, business districts decentralized, and sprawl pushed people further away where density and land use patterns didn’t support transit. The pandemic has only underscored the irrelevance of the hub-and-spoke model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFCD14"&gt;Bob Powers, who runs San Francisco’s BART system, said the morning and evening rush has declined since the pandemic. “The morning peak and the PM peak, you know, kind of come down a little bit, and they’re not so peaky,” he said. “I think it’s a little bit difficult to predict, but I certainly think there’s going to be a change in the rigor of commute hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22zvdH"&gt;Powers said the emergency funding from Congress has helped provide breathing room so BART can think about how it needs to adapt to this new style of remote work while also providing service for women, youth, and low-income workers — “folks that are not 9-to-5 typical commuters” as Powers describes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d347FS"&gt;Rather than mourn the death of peak service, transit experts are dancing on its grave. “The decline of the peak is probably one of the most positive stories out of this,” said Jarrett Walker, a transit consultant from Portland, OR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWphxq"&gt;Transportation systems are made for rush hour. Its why highways are so wide and mass transit systems run more frequently during the morning and evening hours. If transit agencies can pivot to a more reliable all-around service, Walker said there’s no end to the positive change that can occur. “Suddenly, there will no longer be any excuse to widen roads because of rush hour,” he said. “A whole bunch of arguments for things will go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDduZD"&gt;If, after the pandemic, white-collar workers continue to stay away from morning and evening rush hour and instead work from home while using transit as needed, such as to come into the office a couple times a week, then rush hour will continue to stay flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvaJ78"&gt;Running better all-of-the-time service would also do a lot to help lure people out of their cars and reduce carbon emissions. Recent studies have revealed that a single person who switches from a 20-mile commute by car to a bus or train ride can reduce their annual CO2 emissions by 20 pounds per day, or more than 48,000 pounds in a year. That’s equal to a 10 percent reduction in all greenhouse gases produced by a typical two-adult, two-car household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="vdRWMr"&gt;If people can use mass transit to pick their kids up from school or run errands, they are less likely to be dependent on their vehicles. This is also an issue of racial and economic equity. Lower-income people are less likely to be rush hour commuters and more likely to need transit all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1I7Uo"&gt;Transit leaders often point to their experiments with microtransit or outsourcing those services to tech companies like Uber, Lyft, and Via, as proof they are thinking creatively about the future of public transportation. But the humble bus, with its ability to change routes easily, is often neglected in the face of these shinier options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS0v3P"&gt;“A lot of times, we focus on the rail system,” said Zabe Brent, director of design at the National Association of City Transportation Officials. “But we also saw during the pandemic that the bus systems were both more flexible to the changes that needed to be made, as well as more comfortable for a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp5MXk"&gt;A bus with more frequent and reliable service is worth more than anything that has emerged from Silicon Valley, especially if so-called “essential workers” take the spotlight away from white-collar workers as the primary users of transit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcBrCE"&gt;Not only is installing a bus rapid transit system orders of magnitude cheaper than most rail projects, but buses are also scrappy fighters of inequality. Surveys show that the majority of people who use rail are white and well-off, while buses tend to support lower-income riders and people of color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZONq7z"&gt;“How do we redesign our networks in a way that is more considerate of the vast amount of needs of residents instead of just a select few,” said Charles Brown, founder and CEO of Equitable Cities, a transportation consultancy focused on inequality. “Rail is much more difficult because it’s on this fixed track from node to node. Whereas the bus, you have an opportunity to be more flexible and more creative in terms of getting people to places beyond their job.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;11:05 AM on October 8th, 2021 at Glen Park Bart Station, San Francisco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="Y1dl0b"&gt;Before the pandemic, only 5 percent of Americans used transit to commute to work. Ridership was already dropping before Covid even appeared on these shores. The distinctly American habit of driving alone to work, rather than carpooling or using mass transit, has clogged our roads, dirtied our skies, and made traffic fatalities a leading cause of death for many age groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjjpkV"&gt;Those fatality numbers worsened during the pandemic, despite fewer cars on the road overall. Road deaths jumped 7.2 percent in 2020 from the year before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518496/2020-traffic-crash-death-nhtsa-pandemic-driving"&gt;hitting a 13-year high&lt;/a&gt;, even though lockdown orders forced many people off the roads. And as society reopened — and our streets were once again flooded with cars — &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-09/Early-Estimate-Motor-Vehicle-Traffic-Fatalities-Q1-2021.pdf"&gt;US traffic fatalities jumped 10.5 percent in the first quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmc4bg"&gt;Elected officials always say that they believe transit is essential for our cities to thrive in a future that’s healthier, safer, and more equitable. But the way they spend taxpayer money indicates a clear bias towards car drivers, with four out of every five dollars spent on surface transportation going to highway programs. As long as public transportation is “under the boot” of these policymakers, as Transportation for America’s Beth Osborne says, there is little hope that mass transit systems can be redesigned to meet the needs of the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK8mdG"&gt;“Across the board, we fall victim to the notion that transportation is the point,” she said. “Transportation is the point of nothing. It’s where you’re going that is the point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSngTM"&gt;One problem is the restrictions that Congress places on the money. Agencies cannot use funding from the surface transportation reauthorization for day-to-day operating expenses, such as paying salaries and buying fuel. Instead, much of that money is dedicated to building new rail lines, even when agencies do not have the funds to operate existing lines. Federal transit policy is designed for politicians who love ribbon-cuttings as opposed to actual riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="clKCkZ"&gt;As the infrastructure deal nears the finish line, transit advocates are scrambling to secure as much money for transit as possible. Biden’s push to electrify vehicles will help fight climate change, but a clean traffic jam is still just a traffic jam. High-quality transit is the only real solution to our vast, seemingly intractable problems with climate change, inequality, land use, and housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggLG4S"&gt;It can seem daunting, Osborne said, with the virus still raging throughout the country and a sense that the political winds are shifting against those who believe that transit can save us. But huge challenges often beget huge opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MAh8"&gt;“On one hand, it’s like, ‘Oh no, we have to go through a whole other layer of reconsideration and change, and that’s scary,’” Osborne said. “But on the other hand, how exciting! We get to go out and experiment, try things in a totally different way, and service people in a different way that could save them money, save lives, and reduce emissions. That sounds really cool to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smartphone, circa 2031</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0uSK-jagKFFbl4vRhVW99It9YI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073692/acastro_futurePhones_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Small improvements can go in surprising and strange directions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4jZPAe"&gt;What will the smartphone look like in 10 years? The most likely answer, I’m afraid, is one of two options: it’s either completely unknowable or disappointingly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27vqaP"&gt;The story of the smartphone thus far began with technological breakthroughs paired with ingenuity (Camera + Data = Instagram) but eventually evolved into a yearly cadence of iterative improvements (better camera). Ten years from now, when we gaze upon the devices in our hands (or, less likely, consider the implant in our spinal columns), I expect we’re going to be telling one of those two stories again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeSxP5"&gt;The most likely story, as always, is iteration. Absent some breakthrough, we’ll likely have much more impressive versions of the things we can buy today. Nearly every time somebody says that there will be a massive breakthrough in five to 10 years — be it self-driving cars or augmented reality — the safest bet is that they’ll be making the same prediction five years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc4Hyk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36BPI7"&gt;Even with iterative updates, smartphones will be radically better than they are today, and they’ll be different in some ways, too. The screens will be brighter and fold in different ways, the cameras will be so advanced that they’ll threaten to obviate even higher-end SLRs, and the digital assistants inside them will be smarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaFnCJ"&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be. Would Instagram have been born if the original iPhone camera hadn’t been kind of junky? Would it still exist if that camera hadn’t become so good it has destroyed entire categories of products? OLED is just a new way of displaying pixels, but it can flex and uses very little power, so now our phones fold in half, and we take calls on our wrist computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO93Vi"&gt;A simple, incremental advancement in a component can simply make our phones faster — or it can surprise everybody by catalyzing a shift in culture. More of those changes are in our future, and many of them will be emergent behaviors catalyzed by some seemingly insignificant spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Yv9zz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — but that doesn’t mean phones will become less important or impactful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RVhTLB"&gt;Take ultra wideband, for example. It’s the chip in top-end phones that allows them to locate other devices in space and also transmit small bits of data — to unlock a door, for example. Right now, it’s used to locate gadgets in the couch cushions, and there’s a promise it’ll unlock your car door soon. But just as we didn’t initially realize that GPS + Data = Uber, we don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know yet what else UWB could unlock (pardon the pun). I could guess, but such guesses often end up looking like the naive predictions of overly optimistic futurists. UWB could come to naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1dB3Z"&gt;Whatever happens, the iterative path for smartphones will inevitably mean each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — a trend we’re already familiar with today. But that doesn’t mean that phones will become less important or impactful. Instead, they’ll become more familiar and (forgive another pun) part of the fabric of our culture. We’ll begin to more clearly see that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;phones function as a kind of fashion&lt;/a&gt;. That they will follow yearly trends that will be a lot more about style than function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPGhgH"&gt;With any luck, we’ll also have a deeper and more self-conscious awareness of the smartphone’s place in our culture, just as we have with fashion. My hope is that phones will be ever-present without being all-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5b0wV"&gt;I hate to start on a down note about the future of technological progress, but it’s important to stay a little grounded in reality. I could spin a tale about phones that project their displays into mid-air between your fingers. I could predict that we won’t have phones at all but, instead, high-bandwidth jacks plugged right into our brains, connecting us into a 6 or 7G network of wordless, emotive communication. But getting from here to there requires more leaps than can responsibly be made, both ethically and imaginatively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D7DSEA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KR6o3"&gt;Fourteen years ago, Palm founder Jeff Hawkins unveiled his last big idea for tech. He had beat the tech giants in PDA with the PalmPilot and created the Treo smartphone well ahead of the iPhone or Android. His third and final act was to be a different kind of computer, a dummy terminal that simply acted as a window into your phone, where all your real data lived. It was called the Foleo, and it never launched — Palm had more immediate worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD2vIE"&gt;Today, the Foleo seems naive. We don’t need to store our lives in our phones — all that data can live in the cloud. And the phones themselves would become more engaging in and of themselves than Hawkins could have predicted. They’re the engines of content creation and consumption that drive an ouroboros economy worth billions, if not trillions of dollars. Instead of the Foleo, we have Chromebooks and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbhGxQ"&gt;None of those developments had happened in 2007, and few of them would have been predictable. That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd3mR"&gt;We can try to guess what some of those advancements might actually be. Certainly, there are some promising directions like AR glasses, folding displays, the chance that modularity will finally work, and even that our phones will stop consolidating into a single device and instead explode out into a mesh network of tinier, more bespoke gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnyDUC"&gt;We can’t say what phones &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; look like in 10 years. But here are some guesses of what they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; look like. –Dieter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dPJtjB"&gt;Foldables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6WcXfG"&gt;Wouldn’t it be better if our phones could shape-shift into a size fit for the task at hand? That’s the promise behind foldables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0T9d1"&gt;Before foldable devices really take off, a couple of things need to be figured out, starting with the issue of cost. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 takes folding phones a little closer to the mainstream with a $999 price tag, but that’s still out of reach for many people, and the bigger foldables like the Fold 3 remain closer to $2,000. Manufacturers will need to be able to make those folding components more efficiently at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTC58SUgGZxWe47wxCYdS451C7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967707/acastro_211028_0002.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DCK6yF"&gt;Durability is another major concern — foldables require more delicate screens, along with hinges and moving parts that are much more difficult to seal against dust and water than the components of a standard candy bar-shaped phone. Samsung has gotten creative to make its folding phones more durable (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;when in doubt, inject it with cure-in-place goo!&lt;/a&gt;), but many more solutions will be needed for screens that roll and flex. It doesn’t help that we’re all conditioned to expect a certain level of durability from our devices that phones of the future will need to meet. –Allison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itMC2U"&gt;Modular&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RgiF7k"&gt;The smartphone industry has dabbled in modular phones over the years, teasing a future filled with devices that can morph and upgrade as needed, adding on better cameras, different sensors, and surprising new capabilities. But time and again, the idea has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZEXRO"&gt;There was LG’s G5, which let you slide out its bottom section to add on a hi-fi DAC or a camera attachment with a dedicated shutter button. But LG gave up on the entire concept by the next year. Then Motorola gave it a go with its Moto Z lineup, creating a system where accessories could magnetically attach to the back of the phone. There were battery packs, a JBL speaker, a Hasselblad camera, and even a competent movie projector, and they worked across several generations of devices. But sales figures didn’t measure up, and eventually, the modular push fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3oda8GG_rOloHvewsc59p2TgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967721/acastro_211028_0001.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPaRZj"&gt;By comparison to those efforts, Google’s Project Ara seemed like the true modular dream. As the company pitched it, you’d someday be able to swap out individual components of a phone — processor, camera sensor / lenses, battery, and even the display — and keep your original device up to date with the latest hardware advancements by regularly replacing its guts. But the company threw in the towel on Project Ara and its LEGO-style upgrades before ever shipping hardware to developers. It’s a damn shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLE7A0"&gt;There’s certainly a technical challenge to pulling off our sci-fi modular phone fantasies. Google had to pull back on its ambitions with Ara and ended up integrating the CPU and display into the device’s frame, meaning they wouldn’t be replaceable. And perhaps the biggest reason that piecemeal smartphones would never work is profit margin. When Samsung, Apple, and other companies can charge $1,000 for fresh devices every year, what’s the incentive for them to adopt a modular approach that allows consumers to spend less money and upgrade their phones with the latest groundbreaking tech? Maintaining compatibility with a modular system over years could also slow companies from trying to push forward with more inventive, futuristic designs. It’s hard to look at something like the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and see how there’d be an easy way to swap out its components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbVmXA"&gt;But in 10 years, maybe the mobile industry will have evolved to a point where modular phones make a comeback. That, or the right to repair initiative could win so big that companies will make it so much easier to repair our gadgets that it almost feels like they’re modular. We can dream, right? –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Bi61Bf"&gt;Smart glasses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iHmNjZ"&gt;The most tempting prediction to make is that in 10 years’ time, the handheld smartphone as we know it will be replaced — or at least relegated to our pockets more often than not — by smart eyeglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKpYf8"&gt;We’re already on the path, though early attempts like Google Glass were too rudimentary, creepy, and strange-looking. More recent tries from companies like Focal still depend on the phone for too much of their functionality. Meta, the newly rebranded company behind Facebook, is continuing to explore the concept, and Apple’s oft-rumored mixed reality glasses remain in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="phwHeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The main obstacle is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUJBCM"&gt;But it doesn’t take much to imagine a sleek future pair of fully independent smart glasses with lenses that double as private displays for things like our notifications, real-time AR directions, and video streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUDbQn"&gt;The main obstacle between existing and more capable smart glasses is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear in public. Display technology also isn’t quite where it needs to be just yet. Some past smart glasses have projected their UI onto the lens glass, but that’s where things get bulky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfEDH"&gt;The other fundamental challenge is coming up with an interface that makes sense and feels like the right fit between your eyes and the outside world. Eye tracking would have to play some part in that. Think of how often you check your phone throughout the day. No one would want to be constantly futzing with swipe and tap gestures on their glasses that frequently. Voice dictation also needs to evolve beyond its current performance on mobile devices if we’re going to be comfortable leaving our foldable phones or slabs at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtDR8F"&gt;Even if this is all figured out, the tried and true smartphone won’t be history in 10 years — productivity and other tasks simply lend themselves better to a device with a screen and keyboard.  –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YGtT7L"&gt;Ambient computing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="q3kBcs"&gt;In the most sci-fi-fueled visions of the next 10 years, a phone isn’t something we carry around with us — it’s everywhere. Every room in your home has a smart speaker, a screen, a lamp, and who knows what, that’s connected to the network and ready to do whatever you would have asked of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkZoBO"&gt;Outside of the home is more of the same. We don’t carry a personal device with us — it’s in our cars, at our bus stops, in every public trashcan and streetlight. Rather than face the onerous task of taking a phone out of your pocket, unlocking it, opening the right app, and typing words on its little screen, the world around us will simply be equipped to do the tedious stuff for us. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCaPnUdkLnCrjrU7GmTJvS6hfnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967701/acastro_211028_0003.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="509FI2"&gt;Need to send a message to your mom asking how she’s feeling after her bionic limb replacement? Your bathroom mirror was two steps ahead of you and sent the message this morning. Running into the store for last-minute dinner ingredients? Your shopping cart already talked to your refrigerator and knows what you need to buy, which aisle it’s on, and how to pay for it all once you’re done. We’ll outsource the personal bits from personal computing, freed from the confines of little glowing screens and just moving through the world like Sims. It’ll be great. Or awful! Probably awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q89t9K"&gt;There are very obvious and serious ethical problems with this scenario. Equipping the world around us to anticipate and solve our needs requires us to surrender an incredible amount of information about ourselves. And what happens when the almighty algorithm decides that we’re acting suspiciously by analyzing our sleep patterns, purchases, and oral hygiene habits? Just take a look through the last 70 years of sci-fi movies and literature if you want to know how &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; works out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MbIKP4"&gt;Maybe a fully ambient computing life isn’t in our future, but it’s not a stretch to imagine that aspects of this vision could come to life. –Allison&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_VXhIGLvG3iVkIChH6CQbQ6HH0=/0x469:1080x1189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073681/VRG_ILLO_4846_10_Year_social_media.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Social media companies are increasingly super apps that encompass more of what we do online, for better or worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WqWboc"&gt;Say you want to see Japanese Breakfast play in Sacramento next week with a couple of friends. The process of going requires jumping between at least a few apps — you might coordinate plans on WhatsApp, buy your tickets from Ticketmaster, book a ride through Uber, and pay each other back for drinks over Venmo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBAdmO"&gt;But what if all that activity happened in one app on your phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bfgb7"&gt;Over the next several years, I predict that the biggest social media companies around the world will become super apps, acting as gatekeepers to a wider array of things people do online. While they started as ways to mainly keep in contact with friends and family or be entertained, these social networks — Facebook, Snap, and TikTok, for example — will become increasingly important ways people shop, bank, and entertain themselves. Some of these firms that started in the US, such as Snapchat, are already starting to resemble super apps, even though they’re still primarily thought of as social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eM72El"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Western social media firms are playing catch-up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yjPwuZ"&gt;The idea of the super app first gained popularity in China with WeChat, the messaging app that essentially acts as a platform for facilitating life online in the world’s most populous country. WeChat doesn’t just let you message your friends and see their updates in a feed; it can also be used to take out a loan to buy your next car. Commerce done through mini-apps that WeChat lets other developers build on its platform reached a staggering $240 billion last year alone, more than double from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPWqBp"&gt;In the Western world, social media firms are playing catch-up. They’re morphing from single or dual-use case apps — messaging friends or browsing feeds of content — to encompass more and more of what people do online. Last year, Facebook started adding shopping features that keep users from needing to complete purchases elsewhere. The head of Instagram, which is part of Facebook’s family of apps, recently made headlines when he said the app was no longer primarily about sharing photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JomzGl"&gt;WhatsApp, which is also part of Facebook, recently added a directory in South America to let users find local businesses, and in India, it’s trialing banking products like loans. Twitter started as an SMS, text-based service, but now, it lets users natively host audio rooms and newsletters and put their tweets behind a paywall. TikTok recently added an in-app shopping experience and introduced a platform for developers to build their own app experiences into its main video feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VW0dJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Becoming a super app is mainly about becoming more integrated into people’s lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GsMsjw"&gt;Out of all the big social media firms not from China, Snapchat is perhaps the furthest along towards becoming a super app. A few years ago, it introduced mini-apps by other developers that let people do things like play games together, mediate, or book movie tickets — all without leaving the app. There are now more than two-dozen mini-apps in Snapchat, though the company hasn’t disclosed overall usage of them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0IhnA"&gt;In a crowded landscape of apps, becoming a super app is mainly about becoming more integrated into people’s lives and maintaining a grip on their attention, whether it be an endless feed of short videos or an easy way to find clothes to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLekjg"&gt;“Any company that has an app, you’re really focused on getting to the point of being a Home Screen app,” said Nicole Quinn, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who has backed the mental health app Calm and Cameo, an app that lets you book shoutouts from celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6T_Tg-Rvn_zUOMvSaGDpteSoWiE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963901/VRG_ILLO_4850_10Year_Speech_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="numy4G"&gt;A tectonic shift in how the ad-supported app economy works is also driving the rise of super apps. Social media companies that largely thrived from tracking users across different sites can no longer be sure that their ads will lead to someone buying something elsewhere. That data sharing has historically let apps easily track users as they move around the internet, in turn giving advertisers a strong signal about the kinds of ads specific people will respond to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZeMbb"&gt;Apple recently made it harder for third-party iOS apps to share data with other companies for advertising purposes, thanks to a new prompt that’s now shown to users. Google is planning a similar approach for Android and has already announced the end of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Regulators around the world, particularly in the European Union, are in addition contemplating laws that would further restrict the sharing of user data between different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fWj2nH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rise of “content fortresses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HzR0u3"&gt;Simply put, if ad-driven platforms like Facebook can’t track how people interact with other apps, they’ll work more to keep people in their apps as much as possible, especially for activities that involve money like shopping. Eric Seufert, an influential ads industry analyst and consultant, calls this phenomenon the rise of “content fortresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdMJzJ"&gt;Since these changes by Apple and regulators largely don’t restrict how apps collect data about their own users, that first-party data is now more valuable. If a Facebook user makes a purchase without leaving to complete it in another app or website, Facebook can provide that information to the advertiser who paid for the ad that led to the purchase. Advertisers, in turn, pay more money when they know their ads work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NBTeF"&gt;WeChat, by contrast, has been decidedly slow to build an ads business, instead opting to take a cut of transactions done through its app and native payments service. Its parent company Tencent makes most of its money from other areas, such as its many gaming divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="yqFMXm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest risk to super apps is the increasing scrutiny of the tech industry’s power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9AE6db"&gt;Also helping this trend of super apps is pressure being put on Apple — which controls the most lucrative and second-largest mobile app platform — to loosen its grip on what apps are allowed to do on iOS devices. Apple’s rules currently forbid third-party developers from hosting app stores within their apps, and they’re, for the most part, not allowed to accept purchases in their apps without paying Apple 30 percent. Thanks to legal pressure, that’s starting to change. And if Apple’s rule that bans app stores within third-party iOS apps is ever undone, social networks like Facebook could be freed to host app stores themselves, letting people more easily discover mini-apps or web games within their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWDsDJ"&gt;The biggest risk to companies with super apps — or ambitions to become a super app — is the increasing scrutiny of the tech industry’s power. Regulators in the US and Europe are increasingly more critical of the biggest internet platforms. Even China has, in recent weeks, started forcing WeChat and other local firms to open up their platforms to rivals. It’s a sign that the country where super apps first rose to prominence now sees them as having too much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tthP1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are betting on the whole ecosystem becoming big.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VOXyRo"&gt;For now, the biggest super apps are still in China, and they are well ahead in terms of developer activity. There are about three million mini-apps in WeChat and about 1 million in Alipay, the second most popular super app in China. Users in China and other non-western countries have flocked to super apps over the past several years, but it remains to be seen if the concept will take hold with people elsewhere who are already accustomed to downloading lots of apps for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSdE9Y"&gt;The main contenders for super apps are apps that integrate payments, according to Kaniyet Rayev, the CEO of a new startup called Appboxo that builds tools to easily let companies create mini-app platforms inside their apps. He started the company after taking a trip to China several years ago with his cofounder Nursultan Keneshbekov, where they observed how much time locals spent using WeChat. Appboxo is now working with companies in southwest Asia, India, Japan, and other parts of the world to help them build developer platforms inside their apps, said Rayev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TUw0L5"&gt;“We are betting on the whole ecosystem becoming big.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CU5C28"&gt;

    <title>Power Shift</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9YjaO0EWSjpaOANglWyXpujUh2Q=/0x1:2039x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073660/awhite_211010_4785_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVsqK3"&gt;The sun was still shining when Marcia McWilliams lost power in her New Orleans East home. She had been cooking steaks on her stovetop on Sunday, August 29th, just before Hurricane Ida would tear through the city, and was planning to hunker down in her two-story house with her husband, elderly uncle, and granddaughter. But the blackout had arrived early. Up and down the block, neighbors ventured outside to check in with each other. “We’re all looking at each other like, ‘What’s going on?’ The sun was shining!” McWilliams says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIsZu0"&gt;An aging network of power lines connects McWilliams’ home and her neighbors’ to energy sources outside of the city. Ida’s hurricane-force winds started severing those connections soon after the storm made landfall in Port Fourchon, about 60 miles south of New Orleans. When the storm reached McWilliams’ home, it brought damage to accompany the darkness. Part of the ceiling — weighed down by water — collapsed on her husband as he tried to put out bins beneath the leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qobcPY"&gt;When skies were clear again, the blackout on McWilliams’ block lingered. McWilliams hung out on her front porch where she could catch a breeze despite the summer heat and listened to local news on her uncle’s battery-powered radio. “It was just total chaos. We’re listening to everything, and I’m just getting angrier and angrier,” she says. “That was not supposed to happen. We should not have lost electricity when we just built this power plant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYrQbl"&gt;“This power plant” was the brand new gas plant built less than six miles away from McWilliams house. She had fought against the plant’s construction for years prior, worried about higher utility bills and pollution that it would bring to the neighborhood. But in Ida’s wake, she expected the plant to fulfill a promise that had convinced New Orleans’ previous city council to approve its construction in the first place: that it could quickly restore electric service if a major storm ever wiped out power across the entire city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WS9D4h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DRtVL8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K73FYZXlpCucAO-Wwff63eEcMvg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958407/awhite_211017_4785_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marcia McWilliams poses for a portrait in front of her home in New Orleans East, where she stayed during Hurricane Ida. As the president of her homeowner’s association, she fielded calls from residents who had evacuated to warn them of ongoing power outages after the storm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="gaf3br"&gt;The New Orleans Power Station is what’s known as a peaker plant, designed as a backup source of electricity whenever there’s a power shortage. The city gets nearly all of its electricity from gas, coal, and nuclear power plants outside of its borders. If a disastrous storm cuts New Orleans off from those outside power sources, the peaker plant could provide some locally generated electricity to tide residents over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyZE82"&gt;Crucially, the New Orleans Power Station was designed to be able to perform a “black start” — meaning it can start up on its own without needing a jolt from the grid. Ida had devastated the electricity grid, taking out all eight transmission lines that bring power into the city, creating exactly the type of scenario for the gas-fired plant to prove that it was worth its $210 million price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBGGyK"&gt;It never performed a black start. Residents sat for days without power during scorching heat and stifling humidity. Widespread outages lingered across New Orleans until September 9th, 11 days after Ida. Without power, most people couldn’t find relief with air conditioning, fans, or ice. More &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/new-orleans-hurricane-ida-heat.html"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; died in New Orleans from the heat that followed Ida than perished during the height of the storm’s wrath. Outside of the city, residents in more rural areas were left in the dark for more than a &lt;a href="https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/entergy-provides-update-on-hurricane-ida/"&gt;week longer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LFwhm"&gt;Now, New Orleans faces tough decisions ahead as Louisiana continues to recover after Ida. What should the wrecked grid look like in the future? Can it be safeguarded from another storm? Who gets to call the shots?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXupQZ"&gt;For McWilliams and some of her neighbors who came together to try to stop the peaker plant from being built, the answers were clear long before Ida hit. They want a shift in power: from dirty fossil fuels to clean energy and from top-down decision making to bottom-up solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clT4j0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWUC8X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OZkIjj"&gt;
&lt;p id="MfnPAT"&gt;Louisiana has long prided itself as an energy state, although that’s historically been oil and gas. The colors of New Orleans’ beloved Saints football team are black and gold after oil, “black gold,” that made the team’s first owner rich. New Orleans East similarly got its moniker from oil-rich tycoons based in Dallas who founded the development firm New Orleans East Inc, Sarah M. Broom writes in her memoir, &lt;em&gt;The Yellow House&lt;/em&gt;. In the late 1950s, the firm set out to tame more than 30,000 acres of swampy, mostly undeveloped land and turn it into a suburban arm of the city &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02665430801906372?journalCode=rppe20"&gt;designed primarily for white, affluent residents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz9nz6"&gt;By the 1970s, refugees arrived from Vietnam and found a new home in New Orleans East. A Catholic charity helped people escaping war resettle in low-income, subsidized apartments. Refugees coming from fishing villages in Vietnam found work in the region’s commercial fishing industry. They planted gardens ripe with vegetables and herbs common in Southeast Asia: taro, bitter melon, lemongrass, and more. The community blossomed to become one of the most concentrated populations of Vietnamese people outside of Vietnam.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWQjFo"&gt;Green space and bigger homes attracted families like Beverly Wright’s when she was a young girl. “Christmas time came, all of my relatives from in the city who lived in shotgun doubles on raggedy streets saw coming to our house as a place of a reprieve,” says Wright, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Deep South Center for Environmental Justice. “We thought it was the most beautiful place in the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RF94ek"&gt;The area remained a stronghold for middle class Black families and the Vietnamese American community in the city even after an oil bust in the 1980s and subsequent white flight to nearby suburbs. Its diverse neighborhoods span an area that now makes up the largest part of New Orleans and still contains much of the city’s natural wetlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A home rendered uninhabitable by Hurricane Ida on the Irish Bayou.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="Oflpgz"&gt;Dawn Hebert bought her home, a stately two-story brick house framed by four pillars out front, across the street from Wright in the 1990s. But the neighborhood hasn’t really been the same since levees failed to hold back Hurricane Katrina’s floodwaters in 2005. Driving through New Orleans East, Hebert can rattle off the names of businesses lining the road that never came back after the storm. Off the I-10, there’s the dusty abandoned lot where Lake Forest Plaza used to stand, once the biggest shopping center in the state. What was once a Six Flags amusement park is now overgrown, empty ruins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVW2mB"&gt;“I have been a big advocate, honestly, since Katrina,” says Hebert, who is now president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission. “Never in my wildest dreams did I think I would be in the position I’m in right now,” Hebert says of her work holding the city accountable for how it treats New Orleans East. She and other residents have grown used to having to stand up for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbPdiR"&gt;Adding insult to injury after the floodwaters receded, city officials &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_0f67669e-3c7b-5211-b16c-7fc6f18ee91d.html"&gt;proposed a plan&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild the city without including much of New Orleans East — instead shrinking the city’s footprint and allowing wetlands to reclaim areas deemed too flood-prone to revive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2efWG5"&gt;Public outrage ultimately kept New Orleans East on the map. But the community soon became a sort of sacrifice zone for the rest of the city’s recovery. The remains of thousands of destroyed homes and buildings needed to be buried. The city picked New Orleans East to be the final resting place. A freshly dug landfill — which lacked a clay liner to prevent nasty leaks — took in about 150,000 tons of garbage in four months before residents in the nearby Vietnamese American community successfully &lt;a href="http://avillagecalledversailles.com/"&gt;rallied to shut it down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZOXp5"&gt;About a decade later, many of the same residents found themselves defending their neighborhoods yet again from another new source of pollution: the gas-burning New Orleans Power Station, to be operated by the local energy utility Entergy. It would be built at the site of retired generators that were even more polluting. “They try to put everything bad out here for our community that is environmentally unsafe,” Hebert says. After getting calls about the power plant proposal from her neighbor Wright and other advocates, Hebert set up a meeting between the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission, and other groups to let the community know about the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxqUdeQ1gVJHVbrnKHiuLcW9pDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942484/awhite_211010_4785_0020.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beverly Wright, who lives in New Orleans East, founded the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice to tackle environmental and health inequities across the Gulf Coast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="dD5QJx"&gt;It was the beginning of yet another standoff over the future of New Orleans East. “Oh my God, that was a whirlwind,” Hebert recalls. At city council meetings, Hebert and her friends faced apparent supporters of the power plant who showed up wearing matching orange shirts and carrying signs with phrases like, “We need power in the city.” Some were actually actors, hired to promote the plant. One of Entergy’s subcontractors had paid them &lt;a href="https://thelensnola.org/2018/05/04/actors-were-paid-to-support-entergys-power-plant-at-new-orleans-city-council-meetings/"&gt;between $60 to $200&lt;/a&gt; each, &lt;em&gt;The Lens&lt;/em&gt; reported, and the city ultimately fined Entergy &lt;a href="https://thelensnola.org/2019/02/21/entergy-fined-5-million-can-move-forward-with-new-power-plant/"&gt;$5 million&lt;/a&gt; for the fiasco. Now, attendees who want to give public comment at city council meetings have to check a box at the bottom of a speaker card to identify if they are “a paid representative or receiving any type of compensation or thing of value in exhange [sic] for speaking or attending today.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHSHYx"&gt;Hebert and McWilliams had a crew of their own standing up for New Orleans East. “You had environmental injustice, you know, building these plants around African Americans, Vietnamese Americans,” says McWilliams. “We were out there fighting the fight, fighting for them, fighting for us. We don’t want this; we don’t need this. Go with more renewable energy: wind and solar!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nie4GO"&gt;Renewable energy would carry a few benefits for the area: it would improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that fuel stronger storms. On top of that, critics of the plant believed there were better ways to strengthen the existing power grid than building a new fossil-fueled power plant. Aging power lines, which Entergy was previously fined for poorly maintaining, are an especially easy target for storms. So if the city really wanted to harden the grid, it ought to upgrade and fortify those lines, experts said. But the way utility regulation works in the US generally incentivizes companies to spend more money on new capital investments in things like new power plants rather than on maintenance costs for upgrading old power lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFQeQm"&gt;“Basically, we did not need the plant. And why are you paying for something that we don’t need? It’s just crazy,” says Hebert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c922FI"&gt;This time, she and other New Orleans East advocates lost the battle. Entergy successfully sold the plant as a way to make the grid more dependable in times of crisis. “It will provide a reliable local source of power generation in Orleans Parish to help stabilize the grid and keep the lights on,” then-president and CEO of Entergy New Orleans Charles Rice wrote in an opinion arguing for the new plant on &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/opinions/article_29db9f5e-8ebd-5b3c-966b-f10f01a454fc.html"&gt;Nola.com&lt;/a&gt; in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9R916b"&gt;City council approved the plant in 2018, and it came online last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zN3iUF"&gt;Sitting in the second row of city council chambers on September 22nd, Entergy New Orleans CEO Deanna Rodriguez spoke softly with colleagues. “I’m scared,” she told one as she sat in the audience waiting for her turn to come forward before the city council.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYKt4M"&gt;Had she seen the latest investigation by ProPublica, the colleague asked her. “Is it on us? Propaganda?” Rodriguez responded, before telling him she didn’t want to know more about it until after taking the stand. The &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/entergy-resisted-upgrading-new-orleans-power-grid-when-ida-hit-residents-paid-the-price"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;, written in partnership with &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;, had published that morning with the headline, “Entergy Resisted Upgrading New Orleans’ Power Grid. When Ida Hit, Residents Paid the Price.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugFUu5"&gt;The storm took out every transmission line the city relies on to bring in electricity. During the ensuing power outages, temperatures soared into the nineties while lingering humidity made things even more stifling. With nearly all of Southeast Louisiana without power, many residents couldn’t find air conditioning. The Orleans Parish coroner’s office attributed &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/us/new-orleans-hurricane-ida-heat.html"&gt;nine of the 14 casualties&lt;/a&gt; tied to Ida to “&lt;a href="https://ldh.la.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/6308"&gt;Excessive heat during an extended power outage&lt;/a&gt;.” That included 73-year-old Iley Joseph, who was found dead in his sweltering home four days after the storm’s landfall. Sixty-five-year-old Laura Bergerol was similarly found dead inside her home by a neighbor a full seven days after the storm had passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44JSQH"&gt;“Please stop acting like you’re the victim. You are the goliath. You are a powerful Fortune 500 company with all the resources in the world, with record profits last year of $1.4 billion,” councilwoman Helena Morena said to Entergy officials as she opened up a meeting of the city council’s Utility, Cable, Telecommunications, and Technology Committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBO7DK"&gt;Most utilities are regulated at the state level; New Orleans is the only city in the US where the city council is responsible for regulating an investor-owned energy utility while there is already another energy regulator at the state level. The council oversees Entergy New Orleans, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, which provides power across Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas. It gives the council unique power to be responsive to residents’ needs, although the council has been criticized in the past for being ill-equipped to regulate Entergy. With elections coming up, members seeking reelection would soon have to answer to voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd0G5q"&gt;That day, the city council would vote on measures that would launch investigations into the outages, conduct a management audit of Entergy, and commission a study on potentially ending Entergy’s monopoly in the city’s energy market. Entergy had been pressuring them to let up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdT1kA"&gt;The day before the meeting, Entergy New Orleans released a &lt;a href="https://www.entergynewsroom.com/news/entergy-corporation-proposes-potential-pathways-forward-for-entergy-new-orleans/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; with suggestions for the city’s energy future if it no longer wanted the subsidiary to provide everyone’s power: Entergy New Orleans could merge with Entergy Louisiana, sell the utility, or spin off the business to create a standalone company. Or the city could create a municipally-run utility instead. It was a move that some people in the energy business described as a dare or a temper tantrum in response to city council’s scrutiny. Councilwoman Moreno called it a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HelenaMorenoLA/status/1440358247907561473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1440358247907561473%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wdsu.com%2Farticle%2Fentergy-proposes-four-options-to-new-orleans-council-for-future-operations%2F37679244"&gt;ploy&lt;/a&gt;” for the utility to slip through city council’s fingers and find a friendlier regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZaRI8"&gt;“If you hear my voice shake just a little bit, it’s because I’m nervous,” Rodriguez said before she started her testimony before city council. Many of the questions she faced drilled down to one thing: what exactly did the $210 million power station actually do after Ida? Residents are paying for the cost of the new plant with higher utility bills, even if it didn’t do what they thought it would do in a catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jMwYQDU05lOIi015-CK7dKZE8OM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942493/awhite_211017_4785_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“They try to put everything bad out here for our community that is environmentally unsafe,” says Dawn Hebert, president of the East New Orleans Neighborhood Advisory Commission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="GOI4iF"&gt;Rather than perform a black start at the power station, the quicker and safer way to restore power was to get one of the transmission lines back online, Rodriguez said. With a jolt of power from the transmission line, the plant then fired up and helped distribute some electricity throughout the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqAROp"&gt;The power plant hadn’t prevented extended blackouts, though. Some people — including Dawn Hebert — got power back within two days, while others waited 10 or more days. Even after firing up, the plant wasn’t able to get electricity to places where distribution lines were still down. The power station wasn’t designed to generate enough power for the entire city. Instead, it had capacity to meet just under 12 percent of the city’s needs, and the power first flowed to critical infrastructure like hospitals after Ida passed through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7Vbsq"&gt;“New Orleans Power Station did what it was designed to do during and following the storm,” Entergy said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. The utility company referred to residents’ expectation that the plant would prevent outages as “an unfortunate misunderstanding influenced by inaccurate reporting.” Power plants are designed to shut down when lines connecting them to customers are damaged or destroyed, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpwzNY"&gt;Even as power started to come back on, Entergy’s outage maps had glitches. They showed that power was restored in McWilliams’ area even though it wasn’t — seeing the alerts, some residents planned to check out of hotels where they had taken shelter and return. McWilliams spent the days afterward fielding calls from neighbors who had evacuated, telling them it still wasn’t safe to come back. “No, we do not have electricity, do not come back yet,” McWilliams told them. She didn’t get electricity back in her home until a week after the storm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8IUtI"&gt;Rodriguez carefully answered questions from council members, prefacing by saying that a &lt;a href="https://www.wdsu.com/article/class-action-lawsuit-filed-against-entergy-following-hurricane-ida/37667529"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed against the utility by customers limited how much she could share. When city council finished asking questions, it was time for public comment. As the first speaker took to the podium, Rodriguez and other representatives from Entergy got up from their hot seats in the front of the chambers and walked out of the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zJ3WKy"&gt;The majority of comments were made online, which city council began accepting during the COVID-19 pandemic. There were too many to get through, so a designated speaker read as many as they could in 20 minutes. One woman described riding out the outages with her four-year-old child. “I tried my best to be cheerful and positive for my first real experience with a hurricane, being eight and a half months pregnant made it nearly impossible to maintain good cheer in the unmitigated late summer heat,” she shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5801m"&gt;When it was her turn, Hebert stepped up to the podium in a sky blue blouse over white pants and addressed the elephant that was not in the room. “I got to say, the fact that all of them [from Entergy] left means I don’t think they care too much,” Hebert said. “Entergy New Orleans should be held accountable, and changes that should be made are in your control,” she said to the council members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J68mT3"&gt;City council members, responding to Hebert and other speakers, decided to call Entergy representatives back into the room. They returned about 45 minutes after leaving, claiming to have been watching from outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="AmES0O"&gt;
&lt;p id="YTz6BH"&gt;In New Orleans East, just seven miles of backroads and highway separate the post-Katrina landfill, gas plant, and the potential beginnings of a clean energy future. Several months after the gas peaker plant came online in New Orleans, Entergy opened a new solar farm just down the street. It’s at NASA’s Michoud Assembly Facility, which the agency calls “America’s Rocket Factory.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxCNOO"&gt;Also nearby is the nation’s only private testing facility for cutting-edge offshore wind turbine blade technology, according to the regional economic development organization Greater New Orleans, Inc. The Biden Administration recently moved to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725234/biden-offshore-wind-boost-united-states-coastlines"&gt;open up the Gulf of Mexico&lt;/a&gt; to offshore wind, which some Louisiana business leaders and lawmakers see as a big moneymaker for the state in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2KcIz"&gt;Policymakers have begun to accept a difficult truth. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;supercharging the weather&lt;/a&gt;. Hurricanes pack bigger punches than they did in the past. Heatwaves are becoming more unbearable, too. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;rising sea levels&lt;/a&gt; are eating up the state’s coastlines. Together, these disasters will deal repeated, worsening blows to residents and the electricity grid. The only way to stop or even slow that trend is to tackle climate change, which requires slashing the pollution that comes from coal, oil, and gas. And if Louisiana wants to stay an “energy state,” it will have to find cleaner sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fisherman’s Castle on the Irish Bayou in New Orleans was built in 1981 in preparation for the 1984 Louisiana world exposition. It’s now used as a private hunting and fishing camp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="4zTvem"&gt;Governor John Bel Edwards signed an executive order last year setting a goal for the state to cut or cancel out all of its planet-heating greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In May, the New Orleans City Council passed a new energy standard that pushes Entergy to get all its electricity from “clean” sources by the same date. Entergy says it wants to increase its reliance on renewable energy to meet a company goal of reaching net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 — keeping it in line with the state’s targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKGuw6"&gt;It might sound like a short timeline for an energy state to kick its fossil fuel habit, but the deadline falls in line with what &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has found is necessary globally to keep temperatures from rising to a point at which human civilization would struggle to adapt. The Biden administration is similarly trying to set the US on course to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. On the way there, Biden envisions a “100 percent” clean power grid by 2035. So what plays out in New Orleans is a microcosm for the energy transition that’s ahead for other oil and gas towns and the US as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVfeeS"&gt;Slowing down climate change is a global problem. But adapting to changes that are already here — like stronger storms — will require local solutions. That’s especially true for electricity grids like New Orleans’, prone to climate-fueled disasters. Nearly all of the city’s electricity comes from somewhere else, some of it sourced from generators as far away as Mississippi and Arkansas. That’s typical of how electricity grids work today. Giant fossil-fueled power plants and nuclear reactors generate enough power for expansive areas. Electricity from the plants zips along transmission lines, which transport power across long distances at high voltages. The electricity makes a pit stop at a substation near its final destination, sometimes hundreds of miles from the power plant, where the voltage is tamped down so that it’s safer to move through neighborhoods via local distribution lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7rAfRl"&gt;Each of those points — power plant, transmission line, substation, distribution line — could be vulnerable to a disaster like Ida. A storm only needs to take out one link in the chain to cut off power to many communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laPBaf"&gt;Shrinking down the grid and generating power locally is one way to minimize those vulnerabilities. In fact, there’s already a blueprint for how that could work. In 2017, the Department of Energy’s Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratories worked with the City to come up with a plan for how it could make the energy system more resilient to future hurricanes. That &lt;a href="https://newsreleases.sandia.gov/nola_microgrids/"&gt;research identified advanced microgrids&lt;/a&gt; as one potential solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlXpCR"&gt;“We cannot be thinking about the electric system in that linear way anymore,” says Logan Atkinson Burke, executive director of the local consumer advocacy group Alliance for Affordable Energy. “Think about the whole of the system, rather than thinking about the way the system was built 120 years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGDbeg"&gt;Here’s how advanced microgrids might work: First of all, energy is generated locally. That can bypass one potential weak point — transmission lines that bring power in from faraway places. Solar panels, in particular, are easy to spread around the city and still tie together so that they can work in tandem. They could be clustered together in a solar farm, like the one at the NASA facility. Or they could be spread across homes and buildings throughout the city. More than 90 percent of rooftops in the city of New Orleans are well-suited for solar generation, according to one Google &lt;a href="https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/data-explorer/place/ChIJZYIRslSkIIYRtNMiXuhbBts/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUH42x"&gt;There was already a boom in residential solar after Katrina, thanks to post-storm tax incentives. The city &lt;a href="https://environmentamerica.org/feature/ame/shining-cities-2020"&gt;ranked&lt;/a&gt; 14th in the nation for the most solar capacity installed per capita in 2020, ahead of sunny Los Angeles. But to be helpful in a crisis, panels will also need to be paired with batteries that can store extra juice for a rainy day. And local distribution lines will also need to be sturdy enough to keep all those solar panels and batteries connected to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oba78d"&gt;If disaster strikes, especially if it knocks out other parts of the larger grid, an advanced microgrid can automatically cut itself off and act as a sort of energy island. Outfitted with an advanced microgrid, New Orleans East would be one area that’s particularly well-suited to act as a “resilience node,” according to the Sandia analysis. That’s where a relatively small amount of backup generation could power a high concentration of critical infrastructure serving a large population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CtvTlT"&gt;“We’ve been urging Entergy to look at things like microgrids,” Burke says. “Instead, all the money that Entergy has been spending is on their gas infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8JXDr"&gt;Entergy tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it spent $3.9 billion on its transmission and distribution systems between 2016 and 2020. “It is important to invest in generation, transmission, and distribution, and Entergy has no financial incentive to prefer one over another,” Entergy said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “Physics dictates how we invest to keep the system reliable and keep the lights on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7HfoD"&gt;On an even smaller scale, solar power and batteries can benefit individual homes. That’s how Devin De Wulf’s &lt;a href="https://www.nola.com/news/environment/article_3cf5e99e-11af-11ec-a7b0-1f16a8fc2f09.html?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=159746450&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8Z9vQxW-L7oXCVExYyMjYzGZXixSbQFKtoWPHhnHGK0XI8kl0hjgXw4rA_tmWo33a4Cmr3mAOmt5mFD_GvBZS0MON2aCkPee3LlKlmwojTBDRk-H4&amp;amp;utm_content=159746450&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;household kept the lights on&lt;/a&gt; during and after Ida. His family weathered the blackout with his refrigerator, ice machine, and fans. He avoided using the central air conditioning because that would have taken up too much power, but he’s since bought a small window AC unit that he can plug in and power on with the batteries the next time a storm knocks power out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_opVzoUmipzP6yb3e8lKA3mZ8_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958662/awhite_211017_4785_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devin De Wulf founded the organizations Feed the Second Line and Krewe of Red Beans, which have supported artists and essential workers throughout the pandemic. Now he’s working to to get solar panels and batteries to restaurants around the city.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="vDTTYs"&gt;DeWulf, who founded nonprofit organizations that bring food to essential workers, musicians, and artists during the pandemic, helped out his neighbors with his solar system. He set out a power strip on his porch so that others could charge their phones or other devices. And he ran an extension cord to a neighbor two doors down so that he could run his oxygen machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmROFk"&gt;“Nobody cares about us, but us,” DeWulf tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have to be the first responders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoBBs0"&gt;DeWulf’s next project is an &lt;a href="https://www.feedthesecondline.org/getlitstaylit"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to get solar and batteries to restaurants around the city so that they can do the same thing for their communities.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHP7M1"&gt;In the absence of a disaster, microgrids can still function as part of the larger grid system that connects the rest of Louisiana and nearby states. When the larger grid is up and running, a household can sell its excess solar power back to the utility to lower its bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzOQqT"&gt;That bi-directional flow of power is crucial for any future grid that’s built on more renewable energy. It’s another reason why Burke and other advocates have called for more investment in upgraded transmission lines. Sunshine and wind gusts are intermittent sources of energy — they’re renewable, but they can only be tapped at certain times. Luckily, they can also fill in for each other. When the sun is shining brightly on the Gulf Coast, the region can send its solar energy up to the colder midwest. Midwestern states and Texas, where a lot of wind energy is generated, can, in turn, send their renewable energy down in exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S3OQX"&gt;Instead of the linear grid system where electricity flows in one direction from polluting generators, it’s a system built on two-way communication. And even though utility scale wind and solar farms (paired with batteries and other power sources like hydroelectricity) will be needed to meet everyone’s electricity needs, a single home solar system can still contribute when its power is needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCGjuo"&gt;Grids in other climate-stressed places are already evolving with the help of renewable energy. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403271/virtual-power-plants-california-apartment-buildings-solar-energy"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;, where more intense wildfire seasons have sparked blackouts, solar panels and batteries spread across apartment buildings work together as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523976/virtual-power-plants-solar-energy-grid-resilience-climate-change"&gt;virtual power plant&lt;/a&gt;. There are similar projects in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835786/sonnen-solar-vpp-battery-power-renewable-energy-utah"&gt;Utah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/energy/2017/10/15/2-900-solar-energy-homes-battery-backups-planned-prescott-valley/762241001/"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt;. Even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451642/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-energy-grid-battery-day-elon-musk"&gt;batteries in electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; could one day be tied together to provide backup power in disaster scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The streets of Dawn Hebert’s neighborhood in New Orleans, LA are cluttered with trash and debris over a month and a half after Hurricane Ida. Garbage collection was delayed as the city faced a shortage of sanitation workers and trucks. October 9th, 2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="HRalHQ"&gt;Dawn Hebert left New Orleans before Hurricane Ida hit, 16 years to the day Hurricane Katrina made landfall. If her home got as much damage from Ida as it did during Katrina, she wasn’t going back, she told herself. Hebert had evacuated then, too, and came back to find that her home had flooded with six feet of water. “The furniture must have just been flowing from room to room,” she says. Even the refrigerator and heavy china cabinet were knocked over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJXBth"&gt;“That’s why I don’t even have a living room setting anymore,” she says. “Because it’s like — what’s the point?” She has two plush chairs facing each other next to a large window looking out onto the front yard. There’s a crib and play mat for a grandson she babysits during the day now that she’s retired from working at the post office. But the room is relatively sparse when it comes to furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20nJTw"&gt;Thankfully, after coming home to New Orleans East after riding out the storm in Mississippi, Hebert saw little damage to her house in comparison to the destruction during Katrina. While levees failed catastrophically during Katrina, they held up this time. It was a testament to how preparing infrastructure for a more brutal future can prevent a lot of pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7Ddr9"&gt;There’s still pain that’s tangible in the community. “New Orleans East is this place that has this very palpable complex trauma that’s alive because of the environmental racism,” says Jacqueline Thanh, executive director of VAYLA-NO, a nonprofit born out of a Vietnamese American community-led campaign to stop the landfill post-Katrina. Residents have seen their homes flooded, nearly wiped off New Orleans’ map, saddled with garbage and pollution, and then left in the dark after Ida. For refugees, all of that came after being pushed from their homes in Vietnam by war. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okN4ob"&gt;“Looking at New Orleans, I worry about its survival for people of color,” Wright tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;a couple weeks after Ida. “I don’t worry about its survival for rich white people. This will always be their playground. But I worry about the indigenous population and people of color and whether or not we could weather the storm.” Just before Ida hit, Wright had finally been able to finish repairing damage hurricane Katrina had inflicted on her mother’s house. Luckily, the home was mostly spared from Ida’s wrath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BXaYH"&gt;Whenever top-down systems and infrastructure failed them, New Orleans East residents found ways to persist. There’s certainly talk, especially among younger residents, of picking up and leaving. But community advocates see a future worth fighting for. “Imagine the future for New Orleans East where young people can thrive — not just survive it and leave it,” Thanh says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuFj6T"&gt;Structures that have failed in the past can be strengthened so that it isn’t vulnerable communities’ resilience that’s so harshly tested when the next disaster hits. Instead of a gas-fired power plant in their neighborhood, McWilliams and other advocates want to see more solar panels. And after decades of being treated as an afterthought or a dumping ground, they see New Orleans East leading the way to a more sustainable future.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6bOxq"&gt;As the days lingered on without power after Ida, McWilliams coped with the heat with the help of an ice pack that her granddaughter, a nurse, was eventually able to bring to her. “Nana, we just need to move away,” McWilliams recalls her granddaughter once saying to her. “I said, ‘Well baby, it’s not as simple as that. You can’t run from Mother Nature.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OoyTynB7B2hfRiygczt4dBBmtEs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073641/Future_Packed_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iX6fn9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has been committed to longform journalism since our very first day. We launched with a story called “Condo at the End of the World,” and we’ve been publishing deeply reported stories about the world technology has created ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RECnzK"&gt;As part of our look back at the last 10 years of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we wanted to highlight (and, in some cases, remaster) a number of those stories we’re particularly proud of — pieces that had an outsized impact, exposed wrongdoing, or simply brought to life the complicated world behind our screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFcUbo"&gt;Making this list was both a delight — we have published a lot of terrific feature journalism in the past decade, and reading it all again brought back a flood of memories — and incredibly difficult, as we had to actually choose stories to put on the list. But as we looked back, it was striking to see how early we were to ideas that would go on to remake the world: the dilemma of social media moderation; online fandoms; politicians taking to platforms; the inner workings of our minds; the complicated relationship between our cameras and the social justice movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMcyoF"&gt;And, of course, Foxconn in Wisconsin. (It has been 934 days since Foxconn promised an update or correction to our story about its buildings in Wisconsin being empty, but we’re not counting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyYYh5"&gt;Below, we’ve asked some of the people who worked on these stories to talk about them: where they came from, why they chased them down, the ideas that brought them to life. We’re more inspired than ever to produce even more of this work in the future and to continue finding the big stories hiding just behind the obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="FgpxjQ"&gt;It’s 2021, and the world hasn’t ended (yet), but I’m pleased to report that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is still going strong 10 years after its launch. From the very beginning, we were thinking &lt;em&gt;big.&lt;/em&gt; We wanted to tell big stories and make a big splash, which I think is exemplified by my feature “Condo at the End of the World.” This look at doomsday bunker salespeople and other apocalyptic capitalists took me from the center of Ohio to the center of Kansas — two places I had never desired to visit — where I looked down into a 200-foot Atlas missile silo and asked myself, “Would I want to spend the rest of my life &lt;em&gt;down there&lt;/em&gt;?” Of course I didn’t. But the trip was well worth it. The story introduced readers to some far-out characters and presaged the very bizarre turn that American life would take with QAnon and COVID-19 a few short years later. I’ve been on that beat ever since, and I have to thank &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for giving me the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="EXhCUB"&gt;I’ve been at Vox Media for almost 10 years, and to this day, this feature remains one of my favorite pieces of work I’ve done for this company. I don’t remember much about the process of putting it together, but I do remember one of the earliest meetings we had about it. It was January 2014, and James Chae and I were in Las Vegas supporting &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at CES. Shortly before returning home, we met in the lobby of the hotel to discuss ideas for this feature with Josh Topolsky and a few other folks from the editorial team. At one point, James suggested having some sort of toggle so readers could choose the design they wanted, and I said, “What if, instead of a toggle, we do it automatically based on their OS, and more importantly, we don’t tell anyone and let them figure it out in the comments?” I remember Josh’s eyes immediately lit up and he was like, “Yes!” The next few weeks were a blur as James and I worked to put it together. I remember almost none of it, but I’ll never forget how good it felt to see such a positive reaction to it, starting with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; editorial team that day in Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="CaNu6t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/25/5431382/the-internet-is-fucked"&gt;The Internet is Fucked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I987k0"&gt;&lt;small&gt;By &lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/nilay-patel"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt; Feb 25, 2014&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQQWFr"&gt;I wrote “The Internet is Fucked” in a single burst after reading yet another judge’s opinion about net neutrality that seemed utterly divorced from reality — more concerned with reciting magic legal phrases than the fact that most people didn’t have real choices for internet access, allowing their ISPs to do all kinds of icky shit without any threat their customers would leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9goK1"&gt;So I just wrote down the obvious things and said they were obvious. The piece blew up. It was one of the first &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; stories to get serious attention from policymakers on both sides of the aisle. The famous John Oliver segment came out a few months later, hitting many of the same notes. For a moment, net neutrality — broadband policy — was an actual political winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxnCkX"&gt;Lately, it’s become fashionable to say that the net neutrality debate came to nothing — that the worst predictions of what broadband providers would do never came to pass after Trump FCC Chairman Ajit Pai rolled back net neutrality rules in a shady process that he almost certainly lied to Congress about. This take ignores the various state net neutrality laws on the books, most notably in California, and the lawsuits still underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGXOlh"&gt;But another big part of the reason the ISPs aren’t trying harder to break the internet is because they know that people &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; the idea of tiered internet pricing, and they know it because stories like “The Internet is Fucked” exploded. And when there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; competition for internet access, it quickly leads to a situation that looks a lot like net neutrality: providers start giving certain services preferential treatment, then compete to add more and more preferred services, quickly arriving at the end state of giving &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; service the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; treatment. The market works, when there’s a market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="McUbuS"&gt;&lt;small&gt;By &lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/users/K.Ananse"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Kwame Opam&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt; | March 14th, 2016&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OU8y8p"&gt;It was around the time of CES 2016 that I got tapped to write &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Michelle Obama feature. I forget when exactly the discussions with her team in Washington started, but I distinctly remember sitting in that trailer in Las Vegas, going over what we could do, what we should do, how fast we needed to get it done, and how big of a deal it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v29gV7"&gt;If you can recall anything about 2016 other than &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;election, you’ll remember that Vine was in full flower at that point. The former First Lady had made a splash on it — something about turnips — and her team was trying to attract youthful eyes to her initiatives. It was certainly a bit fluffy, but it mattered. After all, here was someone in the public eye trying to meet young people where they were and do some good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWZ90B"&gt;We were going to blow the doors off the thing. I’d leave Vegas early and fly to DC to meet with her team. A week later, Nilay would interview her for the site’s first 360-degree interview. James Bareham would conduct a photo shoot right there in the White House. It was all incredibly ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeUOvX"&gt;And I was not ready. Like, hilariously unready. I’d never written a 3,000-word feature before. Picture me standing in the East Wing in wide-eyed terror meeting functionaries of the Obama administration, not even Mrs. Obama herself. And when we did finally meet, my awestruck brain could only think, “Wow. She’s really tall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J8Rq2"&gt;That line made it into an early draft of the piece. Nilay’s note was something to the effect of, “Cut this. It’s bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ED73Ty"&gt;We got the thing where it needed to be. (Thank you, Nilay and Michael Zelenko, my editor at the time.) There were long, coffee-drenched weekends. Late nights. A few panicked texts and phone calls. By the time we hit publish two months later, I was at South by Southwest, an entirely different event. I don’t think I ever slept quite as well as when it finally went live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rflc5"&gt;In the end, I’m proud to have my name on such a huge project. Up to that point, it was the hardest thing I’d ever attempted. It made me a better journalist. But honestly? Rest in peace, Vine. We didn’t deserve you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3vBRAk"&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Catherine Buni &amp;amp; Soraya Chemaly | April 16th, 2016&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mgUDq"&gt;Over the past five years, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has established a great track record of platform moderation stories. These narratives often take us inside places like Cognizant, where we get a sense of what it’s like to spend all day sanitizing the most rancid corners of platforms like Facebook and YouTube in the modern era. But when Catherine Buni and Soraya Chemaly — two journalists I’ve always admired — approached me with the pitch that would become “Secret Rules of the Internet,” they proposed something I hadn’t yet read: a vivid description of the very earliest days of the content moderation industry. We’re talking untrained college grads in the mid-2000s, improvising rules as they saw fit, and who, through trial and error, would set the foundation for platform moderation as we know it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqnDNf"&gt;The story took more than a year to come together, but the result is one of my favorite pieces I commissioned for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s jarring to read it now and see how so many of the challenges of the moderation industry — as well as the inhumane and harrowing working conditions of those doing the job — were baked in from the very start, back when YouTube was still run out of a small office above a pizza shop in San Mateo, California. I remember being concerned that the morose subject matter might turn off readers, but just the opposite — the story did well, and Catherine and Soraya won a Mirror Award to boot. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Sjab1p"&gt;I didn’t really mean to write “Diary of a Concussion” at first. I just wanted to find something that would tell me what to expect; I’d seen a lot of clinical language about concussion symptoms — totally useless. I already knew what my symptoms were. I wanted to know &lt;em&gt;what recovery was like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKsatV"&gt;Medicine does not rely on first-person reports, but if you are experiencing something, the first-person report is vital — it can also give you a guide to what to expect and how to understand your own experience. I found nothing. If you are a journalist, you know the sinking feeling: &lt;em&gt;this story does not exist and therefore I guess I have to write it.&lt;/em&gt; But it was worse than that, because in order to write it, I was going to have to figure out how to write for more than 15 minutes without giving myself a headache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7f7uY6"&gt;Four years later, I have almost no lingering effects from the brain injury, except for one. My relationship with sound appears to have permanently changed. I listen to a lot less music and am still sensitive to loud noises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ukOIcS"&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Sarah Jeong | Aug 28, 2018&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svAlRL"&gt;I originally wrote &lt;em&gt;The Internet of Garbage &lt;/em&gt;in 2015, when the issue of online content moderation was still a niche topic. The book is written mostly with an eye toward online harassment, since that was what the conversation around moderation and censorship was mostly centered around at the time. In a semi-ironic twist, when I was hired by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, some people (i.e., Fox News) &lt;a href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZM8rBYv59/"&gt;became very mad&lt;/a&gt; about some old tweets of mine (i.e., about white people). I ended up receiving an onslaught of social media abuse, some fairly horrific emails, a lot of creepy calls to a phone number I promptly got rid of, and a few really weird messages from &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/cesar-sayoc-jr-alleged-mail-bomber-threatened-democrats-on-twitter"&gt;a guy who would later go on to mail bombs&lt;/a&gt; to Hillary Clinton, George Soros, and CNN. In the middle of all of this, my beloved colleagues at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; repackaged and republished &lt;em&gt;The Internet of Garbage&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isePDw"&gt;In many ways, 2015 was already a bygone era at the time, and even more so now. But to my regret, the book continues to be relevant. Although many things have changed — from the increasing prominence of fascism in American political life, to specific changes in the law such as the passage of SESTA-FOSTA in 2018 — the issues I tackle in the book have gone from niche to mainstream. My colleagues understood that — possibly because they themselves understood that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, as a “tech” publication, had also gone from niche to mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="47K58h"&gt;“The Trauma Floor” started with a direct message on Twitter: A Facebook content moderator working for Cognizant in Phoenix asked if we could talk about some of the issues they had seen in the workplace. When we got on the phone, they told me about awful working conditions, the incredible difficulty of applying Facebook’s ever-changing rules, and the long-term effects the work was having on their mental health. A few weeks later, I was in Phoenix meeting with a handful of moderators, huddled in my hotel room, piecing together what would come to feel like the most important story I covered at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nzuNb"&gt;Two years later, Facebook reached a tentative $52 million settlement with its American content moderators. A similar settlement seems likely in Europe. Cognizant has gotten out of the content moderation business altogether. From far enough away, it looks like progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LdK9a"&gt;But despite some improvements to working conditions, the underlying issues remain the same. Repeated long-term exposure to violence, child exploitation, and other harmful content can lead to long-term mental health problems, including post-traumatic stress disorder. The moderators I wrote about in Phoenix have moved on with their lives. But I still hear from moderators working for various platforms all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNTU6T"&gt;“The whole 2 year period was really traumatic,” a former Facebook moderator who worked for a vendor in Greece wrote to me in August. She said that she had gone on anti-anxiety medication while on the job. “I’m really happy that I don’t work for Facebook any longer. But I still feel sorry for those people who are stuck in that dreadful workplace!” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="blTrlX"&gt;Ramsey Orta was waiting to get dinner with his friend Eric Garner when the police approached. Orta took out his cellphone and hit record. In the video, which has been seen by millions and sparked outrage across the country, Orta narrates what we see. We can hear his voice move from frustration to anger to fear as he realizes the gravity of what he is recording. As Garner tells his killers that he can’t breathe, Orta also whispers this from behind the camera — “He can’t breathe” — as it becomes clearer that what he’s recording is the death of his friend. Shortly after the release of the video, Orta was routinely harassed by police and later incarcerated. The video did not secure swift and meaningful justice for the Garner family as Orta believed it would. Did he regret recording it? I wanted to ask him this question, and I wanted to know who he was and how his life had led him to this decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilNq2q"&gt;I spent a year visiting Orta in various upstate carceral facilities in order to learn his story and the result is this piece. I was very fortunate that the team at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; saw the value of this story immediately and supported my work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IzrdPO"&gt;&lt;small&gt;By Verge Staff | Aug 31, 2020&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93OpBD"&gt;After the tragic death of George Floyd, I was really struck by what happened to Darnella Frazier, the 17-year-old girl who filmed his traffic death on her cellphone. Not only was Frazier deeply traumatized and bothered by witnessing Floyd’s death, but she later expressed that she was getting a lot of backlash for documenting the incident. As I followed her story, I kept going back to the central question we’re asking in this piece: what compels someone to record police violence and what are the consequences for doing so?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g08Lu"&gt;As I had these conversations at work with other colleagues, it became clear that a lot of us were trying to reckon with the complex role of technology in police interactions. Our executive editor, TC Sottek, sent an all-staff message asking us to really think about what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s platform and resources mean in moments like this. It was a compelling call to action that created one of our most ambitious and wide-reaching projects: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355121/new-civil-rights-movement-police-brutality-protests-film-videos-black-lives-matter"&gt;Capturing the Police&lt;/a&gt;, a multimedia project that explores the documentation of police violence — what happens when you film the police; both the activism and trauma that result from videos of police brutality; and what police body cameras don’t show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnIqQF"&gt;It is a powerful thing to hit record at this moment in history, but it’s also a powerful time to share what you’re seeing online. Yes, this project is about those who choose to record police violence, but it’s impossible to have a voice when you are siloed. So while many of these videos are from particular individuals, it took a community to amplify and share these stories for them to be seen. When you decide to share a video online, you are participating in shaping culture with the click of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udFVii"&gt;We published this project in 2020 and while, for many reasons, it feels like ages ago, so much of what we documented and began to unpack in the project are areas that continue to evolve and raise new questions in the aftermath of a global reckoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZKrol"&gt;In the spring of 2019, I drove around Wisconsin trying to figure out what Foxconn was doing in the state. It was immediately clear what it was not doing: building the fantastic factory it and President Trump had promised. But it was also not doing nothing. It had bought real buildings and put up signs. It had an office downtown, and after climbing a nearby parking garage, I saw there were actual people in it. What they were doing there remained an enigma. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95UxPm"&gt;That changed about a year later, when employees reached out to me to say that not even they knew what Foxconn was doing. Many were just sitting around, hired for jobs that didn’t exist. Others were assigned wild boondoggles — self-driving golf carts, fish farming, glass orb data centers — then berated for pursuing them. They described a Potemkin village so chaotically mismanaged that those in charge often didn’t seem clear on what the illusion was supposed to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nutpqx"&gt;A year later, Wisconsin has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393679/wisconsin-foxconn-contract-amendment-shrink"&gt;radically scaled down&lt;/a&gt; its contract with the company, slashing the subsidies for which Foxconn is eligible. But other damage is harder to undo. The employees I spoke to look back on their time at the company as a surreal, sometimes nightmarish detour in their careers. Many of the people who lived near the project are still furious about the way the city council pushed through the deal and forced people from their homes to clear space for a factory that the residents believed — and now they know, correctly — was never going to happen. Millions were spent to prepare the way for a factory that isn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo46vr"&gt;Foxconn still announces new plans, and they still fail to materialize. The latest was electric cars. Few people I speak to take them seriously. It did finish work on the orb, which stands alone in an empty field. No one is quite sure what it’s for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Our favorite gadgets of the last 10 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOO1VDrov1idyHXHmGAjvnHM2Hw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073627/Fav_Gadgets_Hero_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjuJua"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; launched on November 1st, 2011,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple/2011/10/12/2484524/iphone-4s-review"&gt; the iPhone 4S&lt;/a&gt; was Apple’s newest phone.&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568348/galaxy-nexus-review"&gt; The Galaxy Nexus was imminent&lt;/a&gt;. The&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/17/2568457/playstation-3-five-year-anniversary"&gt; PlayStation 3&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/gaming/2011/11/11/2553265/2011-xbox-360-dashboard-update-beta-rolling-out-now"&gt; Xbox 360&lt;/a&gt; were modern game consoles. The original Amazon Echo&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7167793/amazon-echo-speaker-announced"&gt; was three years away&lt;/a&gt;. The first Apple Watch was&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt; more than four&lt;/a&gt; years away. So many gadgets that we take for granted nowadays looked a lot different 10 years ago or just didn’t exist at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2UYuz"&gt;But ever since day one of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve diligently covered all of the gadgets we could possibly get our hands on. And over the course of the site’s life, some have wormed their way into our hearts (and in one case, a finger), so we wanted to write about them. We’re celebrating a lot for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; 10th anniversary, but this story is our place to nerd out about the gadgets we’ve loved. These are not the best or most important gadgets, necessarily, but the ones that stuck with us.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jv-azSZtOtIMOPt8Kjy6vQYYBtw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972162/iPhone_5___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lAIqO2"&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dibODp"&gt;I’ve owned a lot of iPhones in the last 10 years, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/21/3363238/iphone-5-review"&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/a&gt; was the first. Not only was it my first iPhone, it was the first phone that I went out and voluntarily spent money on, period. Until then, I subsisted on carrier-subsidized Razr flip phones and inherited, indestructible Nokia candy bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTcfF9"&gt;The iPhone 5 isn’t even that notable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/9/14211558/iphone-10-year-anniversary-in-pictures"&gt;in the history of the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, offering a marginally taller display from the 3.5-inch panel previous iPhone models had offered. There wasn’t any big jump in processor, hardware design, or display density (as with the iPhone 4) or new software features like Siri (on the iPhone 4S). Touch ID wouldn’t arrive until the iPhone 5S a year later, and the truly big screen sizes of modern iPhones wouldn’t come until the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus two years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0STh7"&gt;Sure, it had LTE, but given that it was also the first phone I owned with data (that I would quickly blow through browsing Twitter on buses between classes), I didn’t really notice a jump in speed. After years of owning iPod touch models that were only useful near Wi-Fi, any kind of cellular data was a major improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QYq23"&gt;I’ve since moved on to bigger and better phones, and swap devices far more frequently than I did back in 2012. But the iPhone 5 still stands out to me after all these years since it was the first phone that was really mine, and the first “real” phone I ever had. &lt;em&gt;—Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vaybQt"&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpgmmt"&gt;Like Chaim, the iPhone 5 is my favorite gadget from the past 10 years, not because it’s the best, but because it was my first smartphone. I’d owned the likes of Blackberries, but nothing quite like a phone with features I was used to only computers boasting — and with a camera to boot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCyEnB"&gt;That iPhone stands out even more to me because it literally opened up a whole new world when I was going through a rough time. I didn’t have a car or reliable public transportation, so the easy access to ridesharing apps it offered was a lifesaver. Plus, the easy-to-use camera produced such high-quality images, I found myself constantly stopping to take pictures, awakening my creativity. It sounds funny, but that also ended up helping me learn about and embrace the concept of mindfulness. The camera literally made me stop and stare to appreciate the beauty in things I previously thought of as mundane or never noticed — like flowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSv6XI"&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am by no means anywhere close to being a professional photographer these days. I am, however, a far more peaceful, mindful person. I think the iPhone 5 helped me become that way.  &lt;em&gt;—Sheena Vasani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTGiDtBPhHbt3-vDvymzQaLlG08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972163/Valve_s_Steam_Controller___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="UDj70b"&gt;Valve’s Steam Controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="trDoye"&gt;I love Valve’s weird, innovative Steam Controller. It went against well-established design norms, but it’s stuck with me through the years because it lets me fine-tune controls in a way no other gamepad does. Valve crammed in a pair of puzzling, circular touchpads that offer an overwhelming amount of customization, rear paddles for extra inputs, and gyroscopic motion support for aiming. Instead of rumble motors, it had haptic actuators that emulated vibration in games.&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuFeSa9xNkI"&gt; (They could even be programmed to play songs with surprising accuracy.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5jd4Zz"&gt;After the controller was introduced in 2015, Valve rolled out a feature allowing people to contribute custom control schemes on a per-game basis — which meant the gaming community sometimes made better control schemes than game developers themselves. You can even switch to a completely different control scheme while you’re playing a game with the press of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyfZrP"&gt;I don’t think I’ll ever come close to taking full advantage of the Steam Controller, but it helped me achieve success in games that I felt hopeless playing before. For instance, I bounced off &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; on PC numerous times, but I felt much more dialed-in while using the Steam Controller’s touchpad to control the camera. I ended up beating the game with it. It’s also my preferred gamepad for &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhhbDm"&gt;It’s easy to think of the Steam Controller as a failure because, well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;it isn’t available for purchase anymore&lt;/a&gt;. And even if you weren’t a fan of the divisive controller, it had a huge impact on the platform. Valve’s efforts drastically improved support for gamepads on PC, period, and the company proved that some of its weird ideas worked. The upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck handheld PC&lt;/a&gt; basically has a Steam Controller built into it — weird touchpads and all. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NchHoF9jVjrne-LXjAVmx1uWkoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972164/VanMoof_X3___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="7t9ey6"&gt;VanMoof X3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UY2O7W"&gt;Electric bikes weren’t invented during my 10 years at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but there certainly wasn’t anything like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22162936/vanmoof-x3-long-term-review"&gt;the VanMoof X3&lt;/a&gt; available in 2011. An impulse purchase I made in the early stages of the pandemic, back when riding the subway felt like life-threatening behavior, turned out to be my most impactful new possession of the past decade. I don’t worry too much about taking public transport these days — but why would I ever want to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe88kV"&gt;An e-bike like the X3 completely alters your relationship with the city you live in. A steep hill gets flattened out by the press of a boost button. Meeting friends at night turns into an opportunity to travel down miles of streets and alleys you’ve never seen before. A dreaded trip to the supermarket in 98-degree heat and 100 percent humidity becomes a literal breeze. I ride my X3 in almost every situation where it’s practical, and never regret doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFq3dE"&gt;The X3 is a gadget as much as it’s a bike, from the Bluetooth unlocking system to the LED matrix display on the frame, but I mostly went with VanMoof because they have a store and service center near me. In general, I think the rise of e-bikes is the most positive tech trend of the past few years. I’m as interested in new consumer electronics as just about anyone on the planet, but it’s rare that I’d say a product markedly improves my life. The VanMoof X3 absolutely has done that, and I know I’ll never be without an e-bike again. &lt;em&gt;—Sam Byford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7R5Hk5iY_27KGntA-9mO7eyUt9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972165/Asus_Chromebook_Flip_C100PA___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hXy5lU"&gt;Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vTdBwN"&gt;Back in the mid-2010s, when really lightweight laptops were either hard to find or hard to afford, I needed to get myself a small, not-too-heavy computer that I could take with me to meetings and trade shows — specifically, to CES, the huge tech trade show in Las Vegas. As someone with not a lot of upper-body strength who was going to spend whole days wandering around immense show floors, then trekking to various hotels for evening product meetings, I knew putting a six-or-more-pound laptop in my backpack would have me in pain by lunchtime and useless by dinner. There were some really nice lightweights available, but definitely not in my price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="665nN5"&gt;I ended up with the&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-C100PA-DB01-Chromebook-Touchscreen-Laptop/dp/B00YY3X678?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Asus Chromebook Flip C100PA&lt;/a&gt;, a 10-inch Chromebook that weighed just under two pounds and cost me about $250. It wasn’t an ideal computer — the small keyboard wasn’t the most comfortable to type on, and Chromebooks at the time had less access to the type of business apps that might have proved helpful. But it was a joy to carry around, hooked up to whatever Wi-Fi connection was available with no trouble, held a charge through a busy day (its just-in-case power cord added very little additional weight), and allowed me to get my articles written, my day-to-day editing done, and my emails taken care of. And I didn’t have to constantly worry about dropping or losing it — it was a pretty sturdy little Chromebook, and if I did leave it in the press room or have it swiped during a party, I’d be out about $250 instead of $1,250. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvCt0F"&gt;If it weren’t for Google’s unfortunate policy of phasing out Chromebooks (it can no longer get software updates, dammit), I might be carrying it around with me yet. &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g78_cHhCB6_e_l48nyu-xufuPB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972166/iPhone_6s___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="VADtKA"&gt;The iPhone 6S&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CWV421"&gt;Like Chaim and Sheena with the iPhone 5, my nostalgia for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/22/9368415/apple-iphone-6s-iphone-6s-plus-review"&gt;iPhone 6S&lt;/a&gt; probably stems from the fact that it was the first phone I bought with my own money. (Largely because I was working at Apple and got a hefty employee discount, but let’s not talk about that). But it also sticks with me because it was the end of an era — Apple’s last phone to include both Touch ID and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Njouk"&gt;I don’t think I need to belabor the point of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22561092/apple-bring-back-ipods-2021-music-services"&gt;why wired headphones are still awesome&lt;/a&gt; any further, but there really are times that I miss the fingerprint sensor, too. The version included in the 6S was faster than the one that launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/20/4752296/apple-iphone-5s-review"&gt;with the iPhone 5S in 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and while facial recognition systems like Windows Hello and Apple’s own Face ID have largely overshadowed Touch ID in 2021, it was the gold standard for unlocking your phone for a long time. Even now, people will talk about how Face ID doesn’t “just work” the first time like Touch ID often did (which is doubly true in the age of masks). Plus, it’s still kicking on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple’s M1-powered Macs&lt;/a&gt;, even if you could argue they should really use Face ID instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCckiV"&gt;I don’t think I’m alone in loving the 6S. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523351/ios-15-iphone-6s-plus-se-compatibility"&gt;&lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; getting the latest updates from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, though I can’t imagine that’ll last much longer. It’ll be a sad day when the updates stop coming — it was the last iPhone that I could look at without feeling like something was missing. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SPlDfGcKkudCUsxawMGlsxw4oZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972167/Switch___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="vUGyvs"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dw8ZnK"&gt;When it became obvious that my husband and I were never going to return my friend’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, we bought it from him instead. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; had become an addiction for us, even though we didn’t get around to playing it until a year or so after the heaps of positive reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSQp8A"&gt;There was a bit of a learning curve from &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;, which I spent many hours in my teens playing. But &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; brought back everything I loved about &lt;em&gt;Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt; and amplified it to the point I couldn’t quit — even when some cursed glitch between our TV and the Switch dock eventually brought the console to its knees and made it inoperable, we sent it in to Nintendo support, had it “repaired” (they sent us a different, un-cursed unit), and played through the whole game all over again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uukFh5"&gt;This was in the early days of lockdown, and when we beat &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; a second time, we were more ready to move on to other games. (There was quite literally nothing else to do.) So we played through &lt;em&gt;Inside&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Firewatch&lt;/em&gt;. I farmed scorpions in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; when you could still do that. We acquired a PS4 from another friend, and our renewed gaming enthusiasm spread to a whole new platform through hours of &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo 3&lt;/em&gt;, which we’re still playing now (my barbarian build is &lt;em&gt;lit&lt;/em&gt;, y’all). But it was the Switch and &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; that brought me back to gaming after so many years. I wouldn’t even be too upset if we lost our save data and had to play it all over again. —&lt;em&gt;Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2cgPUB"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FVgubR"&gt;There aren’t many gadgets I can say I use every few hours, every single day, transforming my home. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/19/7548059/amazon-echo-review-speaker"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; is exactly that. It sits patiently in my living room, or my hallway, listening for me to shout commands at it. I’ve been using it every day for the past five years to control my lights, set reminders to feed my dog, even turn on my TV and switch channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4In9iK"&gt;While Alexa is not always great at answering general questions, the automations and routines make sure I don’t leave any lights on overnight, or when I leave the house. My original Amazon Echo does exactly what I need, reliably, and it has survived five years of updates without any issues. There aren’t enough gadgets like that these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VBi1G"&gt;Amazon seems to be creeping toward cameras on every Echo device now, and I’m not a fan.  I’m only just about comfortable with a microphone that listens for commands. But as long as the Echo keeps reliably controlling my devices, I’ll be happy in my little smart home. —&lt;em&gt;Tom Warren&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3bvB2j"&gt;Sonos One&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zY1olV"&gt;The first-gen Amazon Echo was a defining device of the 2010s. It represented a sea change for the smart home, and ushered in a wave of Alexa-compatible devices, from speakers to wall outlets to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/21/18103123/amazonbasics-amazon-microwave-alexa-voice-commands-review-features"&gt; connected microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. To be honest, though, I never had much interest in Amazon’s uber-popular virtual assistant — until Sonos threw it into a speaker that actually sounded good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27ATPk"&gt;For me, no product in the past 10 years has gotten more use than the&lt;a href="http://theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/18/16490866/sonos-one-speaker-review-alexa"&gt; Sonos One&lt;/a&gt;. The excellent smart speaker has sat on my desk since I purchased it upon its release in 2017, allowing me to control my lighting, quickly set alarms, and take advantage of a host of Amazon skills that range from clever to borderline bizarre (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447608/bethesda-e3-2018-skyrim-alexa-key"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyrim Very Special Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, anyone?). More importantly, however, is that the speaker is just as capable at kicking out the weather forecast and NPR-friendly podcasts as the searing guitar solos of Adam Granduciel and The War on Drugs, all while maintaining the company’s penchant for rich, balanced sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sSQou"&gt;It’s only become more versatile with time, too. When the One first launched, it offered stereo pairing and seamless integration with the rest of the Sonos lineup. The company also touted future support for Spotify, AirPlay 2, and Google Assistant down the line via a series of software updates. What seemed like little more than promises at the time actually came to fruition, bettering a speaker that was already good enough to begin with. &lt;em&gt;—Brandon Widder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JtXAkC"&gt;Most of the other people contributing to this story are writing about cool gadgets: gaming on the Switch, a particularly memorable phone, an envy-inducing e-bike. So yes, I am deeply embarrassed to be writing about a vacuum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSINDQ"&gt;But you have to understand — the vacuum is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. There are no hard feelings with this vacuum. The range of improvement from old vacuum to this vacuum is just so immense, it brings me joy every time I pick it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CZyZq"&gt;The vacuum is light. It’s small. It’s battery-powered. I can pick it up, vacuum for 30 seconds, and be done with it. It turns what used to feel like a chore (and I mean simply &lt;em&gt;setting up&lt;/em&gt; a vacuum) into something quick and just a little exciting. In an instant, I can suck up a giant pillow of cat hair. Just as quickly, I can stash the vacuum away. There’s no pulling a lumbering appliance out of a closet, no constant shuffling a plug between power outlets, no wondering why the power cord is bizarrely thick and won’t wrap up properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVBdgd"&gt;Why does this device stand out to me so much? Is it because I’m over 30 now? Is it because I got a cat? I don’t know. But I never expected to have any positive feelings toward a vacuum, and that delta stands out every time I use the Dyson. &lt;em&gt;—Jake Kastrenakes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ILLTyw"&gt;Moto X (2013)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fTPg55"&gt;I miss my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/5/4588922/moto-x-review"&gt;Moto X&lt;/a&gt;. In a world of ever-expanding rectangular slabs, it was a one-handed phone with a silky soft-touch curved back and a perfectly placed divot to rest my index finger. I could easily stretch my thumb across its 4.7-inch screen without feeling like I’d lose my grip. It was also &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt; in a way no phones have been before or since: I chose a Kevlar patterned back and shiny blue power and volume buttons — thanks to Motorola’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNchwJRrv90"&gt;groundbreaking Moto Maker website&lt;/a&gt; that let you mix and match component colors to create your own personal combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt9rtJ"&gt;It had seriously useful one-handed features, too: I’d whip it out of my pocket and twist it left and right to launch the camera, mimic a chopping action to fire up the flashlight, and say “Okay, Google Now” to launch the voice assistant. Oh, did I forget to mention that as the first major release from then-Google-owned Motorola, it was also the first to come with a proto-Google Assistant? Near-stock Android, too. Forget Google’s Nexus phones — the 2013 Moto X was the Pixel before the Pixel, and both were overseen by now-Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7w5z2"&gt;Unfortunately, the Moto X was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/3/4491756/moto-x-everything-you-need-to-know"&gt;also an ill-fated attempt at US gadget manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; and a phone with lackluster midrange components, and few ever saw the wonder I did. Motorola was forced to offer deep discounts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/6/5786442/motorola-promo-lets-you-try-moto-x-for-14-days"&gt;even let people try one for a penny&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/30/5764836/motorola-shutting-down-us-assembly-plant"&gt;close its Texas factory&lt;/a&gt; and ditch its made-in-America dream. In 2014, it launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/8/6121143/motorola-moto-x-2014-new-review"&gt;second-gen Moto X&lt;/a&gt;, which we briefly called “The best Android smartphone ever made,” but the magic was gone for me. The newer 5.2-inch handset felt far too big. Today, I’m rocking an iPhone 13 Mini. It’s within a tenth of an inch of the original Moto X in height and width, and it’s thinner. I just wish it had a nice divot and a faster way to summon the camera. &lt;em&gt;—Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="dRIfOM"&gt;Nest Learning Thermostat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pzAtfp"&gt;I’m crazy about climate control. What sparked this love affair? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/14/2559567/tony-fadell-nest-learning-thermostat"&gt;The Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt;. No, not the dinky plastic thing Google is pushing now, but the original, gloriously spinny, solid metal marvel that is the Nest Learning Thermostat. I purchased two in 2013 when I moved into a 1960s ranch house in steamy South Carolina. We had a new heating and air conditioning unit installed, and the technician looked at me like I was bonkers when I handed him the gadgets. But considering he was going to charge me $400 for a couple of dinky plastic analog thermostats, the Nest was a relative bargain at $250 a pop. In the decade since, I always return to the Nest. I test smart thermostats for a living, so I’ve installed approximately two dozen since the Nest’s 2011 debut, and none of them have ever made me as happy nor as comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZpNhy"&gt;As a piece of tech, the Nest does the two things every smart home gadget should do, and it does them both brilliantly. It works with almost no intervention from me — I don’t have to worry about it, mess with it, program it, or troubleshoot it. And it looks really smart. The first-generation model I have (and which still works flawlessly) has a better design than all its competitors. The third generation, with its Farsight feature, adds another level of usefulness, doubling as a clock or indoor weather station. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lquEyN"&gt;As a way to control my climate intelligently (a real challenge in the South where temperature swings of 30 degrees in one day are not uncommon), the Nest has never failed me. Many others have. And while I do mourn the smart home flexibility I lost when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537331/google-nest-cancellation-assistant-smart-home-integration-report"&gt;Works with Nest was killed&lt;/a&gt; (and no, Google has not replaced all that functionality yet, despite its promises), as a smart thermostat, Nest is still undoubtedly the best. —&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJPDtGnJM3dfTkzZYjcfOGa3PVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972173/Sony_RX100___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Jgyn8V"&gt;Sony RX100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AP3QSi"&gt;While a laptop has been the most essential part of my job, nothing has given me more of a sense of accomplishment than using Sony’s little point-and-shoot camera, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3187725/sony-rx100-review"&gt;the RX100&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve gone through several iterations and loved every single one. The magic of the RX100 is that it puts all the mirrorless camera features I need into something pocketable. It’s always competent in auto mode, and if I’m feeling confident I can step into full manual mode and get something better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOuTqV"&gt;Often, I need something small that actually does a good enough job to publish on our website. Until relatively recently, smartphone cameras weren’t up to that task. Instead, I used an RX100. I’ve used it to liveblog entire Apple keynotes, tethered to a Mac. While everybody else around was using heavy DSLRs, I was getting good-enough photos with my tiny point-and-shoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLeaVj"&gt;The RX100 (and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328971/sony-zv-1-review-vlogging-4k-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;the ZV-1&lt;/a&gt;) have also been essential on-ramp tools for video, at least for me. For a relatively affordable price, I’ve been able to shoot my own &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; review videos. The fact that these cameras have Sony’s best-in-class eye autofocus has also been a huge boon. With most cameras I tend to not trust autofocus enough and go full manual, but when you’re shooting entirely on your own (especially when you’re not a pro), focus issues are often a recipe for reshoots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RVoTFI"&gt;Smartphones have nearly caught up to (and in some cases surpassed) the image and video quality of the RX100. Full-size mirrorless cameras with interchangeable lenses have gotten better than the RX100 too. Even though RX100 cameras are not as essential now as they once were for me, it’s still the camera that helped me learn how photography and video works on a practical level, so it’s my favorite. &lt;em&gt;—Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GTaZHLutJDI_n5WLGSAEbJkjnvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972175/Leica_m9___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FAXzuY"&gt;Leica M9&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CMdxkd"&gt;In January 2013, living rent-free in my mom’s basement, the Leica M9 convinced me to blow an absurd amount of money I had no business spending. The M9 was groundbreaking for its time, with a full-frame 18-megapixel sensor in a compact and portable system camera coupled to a lens ecosystem dating back to 1954. Its rear LCD was a low-res joke, its battery life was awful, and its processing speeds felt like it had the CPU of a TI-83 Plus graphing calculator, but the experience was one-of-a-kind and the files were rich with amazing image quality. It sold incredibly well for a camera priced at $7,000, in part because the primary competition was bulky DSLRs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sO8KH5"&gt;It ended up being a worthwhile investment, as it got me engaged in an enthusiastic side of photography I had not felt since Photo I class in college — and led to a nearly seven-year career at Leica itself before I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZdg4X"&gt;Yes, it was released in 2009, but I bought mine secondhand in January 2013 so I’m not entirely cheating. I’d first picked up an old Leica M6 film camera and started enjoying how the rangefinders handled. When I saw an M9 listed for sale on a photo forum, I realized I could combine that experience with digital convenience. We were reaching peak-DSLR around then, and the M9 was the grail of the pre-mirrorless world. It helped me approach photography in a new way and made me feel more cultured than I was as a DSLR snob: A manual focus rangefinder is like a palate cleanser in a world awash with varying degrees of the same flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uITJuQ"&gt;Now, mirrorless cameras are ubiquitous for most enthusiasts and pros, all but sealing the fate of DSLRs the same way that smartphones have largely replaced point-and-shoot cameras, and the M9 is showing its age. But if the M6 I still own today is the film camera I may take with me to the grave, the M9 is the camera I’ll always recall as a gem of the digital photography age. —&lt;em&gt;Antonio G. Di Benedetto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="sfcNGi"&gt;HTC Flyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bqgyUn"&gt;The HTC Flyer was the first tablet I owned, and it’s one of the few pieces of old, unused technology I refuse to part with. It went on sale in May of 2011 – technically before &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; launched, but there was a review on ThisIsMyNext.com and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/18/2497587/htc-flyer-review"&gt;that review still exists&lt;/a&gt; – and I knew I wanted it as soon as I saw it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MP7ESC"&gt;The feature everyone talked about was the stylus. Well, that and the fact that it ran Android 3.0 Honeycomb, which seemed like a big deal at the time. That stylus was a complement to one of my favorite features on any device I’ve ever owned: the bezel. Yes, the bezel on the HTC Flyer is perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIMZKv"&gt;It curves up, and that curved corner nestles your thumb perfectly and makes the device much easier to hold. And because the bezels are so thick, your thumb won’t accidentally tap a button while it’s over there. Another surprise: that thick, curved bezel also houses a button that can only be activated by the stylus. Click the stylus on the button and you get a radial menu with all the drawing options you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxCQbi"&gt;Truly, no one thought about bezels the way HTC did. They decided to make them a feature, not a burden. So while tablets might have “edge-to-edge screens,” they’re missing out on being perfect. &lt;em&gt;—Creighton DeSimone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSxFU--ipc8M1ChXQgXHWxT8N2I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972177/Anker_Powercore_5000___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Qg1Ini"&gt;Anker PowerCore 5000&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AlSjVd"&gt;A battery pack might seem like the most boring gadget, but a) it’s not and b) just listen. Over the past 10 years, no other single gadget has been more useful to me than my battery packs. No other gadget has saved the day so frequently or helped others so much in their time of need. No other gadget is as welcome in its appearance or as uncomplicated in its use. There are no drivers to install or settings to fiddle with, just “charge me and I will charge you” — less an instruction manual and more a mantra of cosmic benevolence. Without battery packs, other gadgets would fail. With battery packs, they are lifted up for second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gvlqw"&gt;Over the years I’ve owned units of varying wattage and design, but eventually settled on one particular product: the Anker PowerCore 5000. It is, to me, the epitome of the genre: a small, sleek cylinder that nestles reassuringly in the hand and slips easily into bags and pockets. I used to pair the PowerCore with a hardshell carry case and bags of short braided cables, Lightning and Micro-USB, that tucked neatly into a mesh compartment. It was an unbeatable combo, every element simple and practical. Taking it out of your bag and plugging in an ailing phone or pair of earbuds felt like the action of someone who knew what they were doing in life. Someone with a plan. It was such an effortless pairing that I used to buy a PowerCore, case, and cables for friends and family as gifts. “Oh, thank you, I guess,” was the initial reaction. Then, some weeks later: “Oh my god, thank you, this is actually so useful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukT2VO"&gt;That was, of course, when battery packs were necessary items. I don’t use mine as much these days, partly because phone batteries are bigger and partly because being confined indoors for the last couple of years has lessened the need. But there are still times when I think, “Hmm, don’t want to run out of juice,” grab my little pack and drop it into my bag. It’s a little dose of certainty. A solution to a problem no one should have. A king among gadgets. —&lt;em&gt;James Vincent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pMzOgGqE3zmnVGydBZZ1QHv2OWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972178/Philips_Hue_Lights___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cXFELw"&gt;Philips Hue Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jaYgb8"&gt;Every weeknight at 5:15 my desk lamp automatically turns off. Middle of winter or the height of summer, that light powers down, and I’m reminded that the work day is nearly over and I should start wrapping things up so I can sign off. It’s because I stuck a Hue lightbulb in there. Smart lights are a very minor part of the long-promised and rarely-delivered future smart home, but they’re something I use every single day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCzvpf"&gt;They were first installed when I lived in a tiny “half bedroom” that required crawling across the bed to turn on the lights when I got home. At the time the extremely pricey bulbs were a necessary luxury. Finally, a way to enter my bedroom at night and not be immersed in total darkness! I made a similar excuse when I moved into a practically window-free basement two years later and dropped $400 on Hue bulbs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vETQg9"&gt;Years later the price of the bulbs has come down. Heck, you don’t even need a $50 hub to make the new Bluetooth ones work. Plenty of much more affordable imitators have followed in Hue’s footsteps (I have some of them, too). Most people know Hue for the vibrant colors the bulbs cast, and you can spend hours on Reddit looking at people’s Dayglo-lit homes festooned in more LEDs than a Vegas hotel lobby. But I love them for their consistency and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s7jGq"&gt;Sure, I can light my house like a John Wick movie. But the real value is having the lights pop on when I return from a dog walk, or cast the bathroom in a cool glow when I stumble there at 2AM. It took me a few days to program them to automatically do the things I want. Then, I stopped thinking about lights entirely. —&lt;em&gt;Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="B6JMUj"&gt;The WhiteFox &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N8R1iI"&gt;Of all the mechanical keyboards to have emerged over the past decade, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/19/16001200/whitefox-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter-input-club"&gt;the WhiteFox&lt;/a&gt; is the one I’ve loved the most. Developed by a passionate group of keyboard enthusiasts and sold via what was effectively a crowdfunding campaign on Massdrop in 2015, the WhiteFox brought a level of quality you’d normally only find in keyboards you assemble yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6OC9c"&gt;Priced between $200 and $300, the WhiteFox was wildly expensive, and lacked the bells and whistles you’d get out of much cheaper and more mainstream models from the likes of Razer and Corsair. But what it lacked in functionality it made up for with sheer charm: The WhiteFox really is bizarrely small and compact compared to what most people think of when they imagine a computer keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lql9IE"&gt;Of course, the WhiteFox was also designed to be easy to take apart and tinker with, so you better believe that’s exactly what I’ve done with mine. The original far-too-stiff Cherry MX Clear switches have long since made way for a set of crisp Zealios, and the original keycaps swapped out for another set in a lovely retro beige color scheme. My WhiteFox came with a UK layout as part of the original production run, and was a variant that manufacturer Input Club never produced again. I later found out that it abandoned the layout because of the lack of interest, and that my UK-layout WhiteFox was one of only 20 ever produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fnS979"&gt;Although I’d always intended the WhiteFox to be the last keyboard I ever bought, my presence as &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; resident keyboard weirdo has meant that I barely get to use mine anymore as I hop between newer models. But damn, it’s just such a nice keyboard. —&lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="zN41I4"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 20 earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zAH6ID"&gt;When I first flipped the switch on these noise-canceling earbuds, it felt like stepping into another dimension. I hadn’t really had any noise-canceling tech until I got the Bose QC20 for Christmas years ago. Before, when it got noisy, I just turned up whatever headphones came along with my phone, and tried to make do. Now, I could turn down the outside world as well — and the soft tips were vastly better than the hard plastic I was used to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPZ8Li"&gt;I’ve never been a huge audiophile, so I didn’t care that they were as bass-heavy as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/4/4395834/bose-quietcomfort-20-soundlink-mini-hands-on-impressions-photos"&gt;my colleague Chris Welch wrote back in 2013&lt;/a&gt;; I slowly loved them to death. They helped drown out the noise from my neighbors in the apartment with the paper-thin walls. They accompanied me through the rumbling New York subway on the hour-long trek to Queens where my boyfriend (now husband) lived. They shushed the roar of planes as I traveled to see my family scattered in different states. Along the way, I abused the heck out of them. They got tossed into the bottom of my purse, tangled around pens, scratched and bumped and jolted, and yet they kept working through it all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gDeu1"&gt;After many years, I noticed the casing was cracking near the charging port, and the coating on the wire near the headphone jack was splitting, but I kept using them until a recent Christmas when I was gifted a set of AirPods Pro. The new wireless noise-canceling earbuds relegated my old wired headphones to the bucket o’ e-waste in my pantry, where they now sit atop a heap of dead batteries. They didn’t stay with me forever, but they were great while they lasted. —&lt;em&gt;Mary Beth Griggs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bQsq0Y"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lDz6G4"&gt;Out of all the many smartphones I’ve played with over the past 10 years, I’ve always loved the Samsung Galaxy Note the most. From the first time I heard about the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/2/16/2802063/samsung-galaxy-note-at-t-review-pricing-availability"&gt;first-generation Note&lt;/a&gt; with the S Pen in October 2011, I was hooked. The OG Note’s 5.3-inch HD Super AMOLED display was positively monstrous. Journalists and consumers were falling over themselves coming up with new “phablet” jokes. (Is the Note a phone or a tablet or IS IT BOTH?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhaSqg"&gt;But what Note fans knew from the get-go was that a bigger screen also meant a bigger battery, and the Note was the biggest of all. Whenever my iPhone-toting friends ran out of power, I’d still have at least enough juice to get me home. Of course, the battery also got Samsung into a lot of trouble with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/2/12767884/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-statement"&gt;cursed Note 7&lt;/a&gt;, but they were recalled before I could buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8P1S42"&gt;Since I didn’t (and still don’t) take many phone calls, I’ve always appreciated that the Note lets me do more than just consume content. I’ve been able to sign important documents, create a lookbook for my wedding, and annotate screenshots to provide remote tech support to my parents. I’m pretty sure I can’t say the same about other gadgets I’ve used in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOyuob"&gt;If rumors are true that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22627058/samsung-galaxy-note-stylus-z-fold-3-a-series"&gt;Samsung will retire the Note&lt;/a&gt; after this chip shortage, it’ll be the end of an era for me. But I might go back and buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; to round out my collection. —&lt;em&gt;Gloria Sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="u8Xgl5"&gt;AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VckUnZ"&gt;I am pretty sure I use my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; more than any other gadget I own. While I work, my AirPods basically never leave my ears. During the weekend, I use them to listen to music and podcasts while I’m on a long run or walking around the city. And now that the Nintendo Switch finally supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;, AirPods are my headphone of choice for after-work gaming sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9QAjf"&gt;Sure, AirPods don’t sound as good as other in-ear buds. &lt;em&gt;But they’re just so damn useful&lt;/em&gt;. They connect reliably to my phone and computer, recharge quickly in their case, and are small enough to carry around in a pocket, meaning that I can immerse myself in audio nearly everywhere I go, with no muss, no fuss, and no wires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFrGiR"&gt;I was dubious of AirPods when Apple first announced them in 2016, but ever since I started using them, I’ve been a believer. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kti0-EH3kJiYveM17CU14C7pOKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972183/Surface_Book_2___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="G6PhVW"&gt;Surface Book 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="b92bvZ"&gt;I have loved many things in life, but few can top the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16658466/microsoft-surface-book-2-review"&gt;Surface Book 2&lt;/a&gt; that I purchased for myself in 2018. &lt;em&gt;But Monica&lt;/em&gt;, I can already hear the Twitter masses shrieking, &lt;em&gt;the Surface Book is silly-looking, ridiculously top-heavy, and way too expensive&lt;/em&gt;. Sure, whatever. It’s also awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epwR71"&gt;The most common criticism I hear is nobody knows how they’re supposed to use the detachable screen. First off: piano music. I am card-carrying Gen Z; I don’t own a printer and have no idea where I’d print something if I wanted to. My piano music lives on my computer. Prior to my purchase of the Book 2, I was doing all kinds of magic tricks to balance a 2013 MacBook Pro on my piano stand. No longer — I pop the screen off, and it fits perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDbsY3"&gt;Second: carrying. Two-in-one computers are great, but they’re almost all too heavy to comfortably hold up as a tablet for long periods of time if you’re planning to use one to give a presentation, or just to walk around your kitchen with while waiting for water to boil (which I unashamedly do all the time). Even the Surface Pro 8 is close to two pounds. But the Surface Book’s tablet is a &lt;em&gt;tablet&lt;/em&gt; tablet. It’s just over a pound and a half; it’s light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpQLai"&gt;The magic of the Surface Book goes beyond its detachable screen; it’s the use cases that it uniquely combines into one. There is no other device on the market where you can run AAA games &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; carry it up to a keynote one-handed. Sure, you could buy a Razer Blade and an iPad. But I like having them as one thing. If I’m going on vacation, or going to a friend’s house, or traveling to a conference, I only need to put one thing in my backpack. It’s great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaDsNE"&gt;Finally, battery life. The Surface Book 2 has two batteries — one in the base, one in the tablet — and it never dies on me. I use it for hours every day, and charge it very occasionally. It’s great to never have to worry about bringing a charger with me if I’m going out to a coffee shop or on a day trip. My lifestyle has adapted so much to the Book 2’s battery life, I’m at a bit of a loss for what to buy next (because the Surface Laptop Studio’s lifespan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716121/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-review"&gt;just doesn’t cut it&lt;/a&gt;). If not Microsoft, I hope another company will find a way to replicate this. —&lt;em&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mQJ94I2RvLDuPCyxVT7146h2l5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972184/Logitech_PowerPlay_mousepad___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="y1PHvH"&gt;Logitech PowerPlay mousepad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0kJ4Ff"&gt;There is something undeniably cool about having a top-tier wireless gaming mouse that you never have to plug in. Logitech’s Powerplay system just works. You plug a $120 mouse pad into your desktop, slot a small, silver-dollar-sized disc into your Logitech mouse of choice, and you’re done thinking about cords and charging for good. Clarke’s third law states that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and wireless charging feels like it to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJ4dST"&gt;I personally own several bags that are full of charging cables that I’ve collected over the years, cables that will almost certainly, eventually, end up in a landfill. Then I think about all the gadget fiends I know and how they’re probably in a similar position. When was the last time you saw someone on &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; looking for a charging cable for their tricorder? If we can get wireless charging to a point of ubiquity, we’d save a substantial amount of e-waste, or at least cut down on the number of friendships that get ruined because SOMEBODY stole SOMEONE’S iPhone charger (you know who you are).       &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmlwwU"&gt;I know we’re a long way off from being able to charge our devices simply by walking into a room, or being able to eliminate outlets altogether. But wireless charging belongs in more stuff, and I’m excited to see how we apply it in the future. —&lt;em&gt;Alice Newcome-Beill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="pqo4ys"&gt;Pebble Time Round&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="G8WCh7"&gt;Let’s face it — most smartwatches are just beepers on your wrist. Apple figured out how to turn them into a fitness device. But the best alternative to the Apple Watch? Pebble. Support for Pebble devices officially died in June 2019, and there still hasn’t been a smartwatch like it since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9b5Mu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/5/9675612/pebble-round-watch-review-time-smartwatch"&gt;Pebble Time Round&lt;/a&gt; was the first time I could wear a smartwatch without it drawing attention. It didn’t look like a smartwatch at all, where other wrist devices stood out and made a statement whether you liked it or not. Almost every day, I would go into the Pebble watch face store on the app and find a watch face that fit my mood, wardrobe, or interests at the time. Pokemon Go was huge, so I had a Pikachu watch face. If I wanted to go retro, there were dozens upon dozens of watch faces to choose from. And the buttons! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585819/pebble-smartwatch-hardware-button-touchscreen"&gt;Side buttons just make sense for a watch&lt;/a&gt;. Easy to control with gloves or wet hands. Intuitive to how watches have worked for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmI4Yd"&gt;Fitbit bought Pebble, then Google bought Fitbit. But somehow there still hasn’t been a smartwatch with the sleek and functional design of the Pebble Time Round. Why? —&lt;em&gt;Andru Marino&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gkApWBrZMGqiiv7ItfF_qxFf3Oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972186/Toshiba_Satellite_Radius_12___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="LibBkT"&gt;Toshiba Satellite Radius 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YOOdBH"&gt;I am a bad gadget owner. I have a tendency to drop or otherwise (unintentionally! inadvertently!) abuse phones, laptops, and any other gadget that has the misfortune of coming into my orbit. Whatever the electronic equivalent is of a brown thumb in gardening, that is what I have. I try to avoid buying the newest iteration (I know, I know) of phones and computers, because I’ve become very risk-averse and instead wait to acquire expensive electronic devices only after they have been thoroughly vetted by more adventurous and knowledgeable peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="inTPLn"&gt;One of the rare times I did stray from my self-imposed gadget rules was a few years ago when I left my miserable day job for a (brief) stint as a full-time freelancer, and I needed a new laptop. I got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9240199/toshiba-satellite-radius-12-4k-laptop"&gt;Toshiba Satellite Radius 12&lt;/a&gt;. Reader, I absolutely loved it. It was the most substantial computer I have ever owned, from its chunky form factor, its impossibly heavy weight, its mostly useless ability to convert from laptop to tablet, its beautiful touchscreen, and its squishy, backlit keyboard. I should probably not do product reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47CDu5"&gt;It was too big to reasonably fit into any normal-sized shoulder bag (so I got a bigger one, obviously), and it was so heavy that after lugging it around all day I usually had a sore neck (yes, I am saying the thing I loved was literally a pain in my neck). It was beautiful, and it could tolerate my abuse more than any other device I had ever owned, as if it knew I didn’t mean it when I dropped it on the subway or spilled water (OK it was wine) on its keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUWWME"&gt;Eventually, the hinge that let it convert from laptop to tablet wore out, and damaged the power socket which was located impractically close to the hinge so I could no longer charge it, despite the valiant efforts of the guys at my local uBreakiFix shop. I still mourn this laptop’s demise — and I have not been able to part with it completely, so it occupies an obnoxiously large spot on my bookshelf. I was saddened when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21361081/toshiba-laptop-sharp-pc-computer"&gt;Toshiba announced&lt;/a&gt; it was getting out of the laptop business because it meant I wouldn’t ever be able to find a suitable updated version. I will never forget you, Toshiba Satellite Radius, you big, dumb, beautiful mess. —&lt;em&gt;Kim Lyons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9aXFxzFESprM5yP6s6_2N_uO0WI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972187/Zboard_pro___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="MV0V1c"&gt;ZBoard Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kpQ1bp"&gt;The ZBoard Pro wasn’t the lightest, or the sleekest, or the fastest electric skateboard. It wasn’t the easiest thing to learn to ride. The small company that made it was around for just a few years before vanishing into oblivion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUrPOB"&gt;But the experience of riding the ZBoard Pro still kicks around in my brain more than any other electric skateboard — more than even the many smooth, quick trips I’ve taken over the years with the category-defining boards Boosted made before it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22575594/boosted-electric-skateboard-khosla-lime-lawsuit"&gt; went out of business&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0g9sI"&gt;The original ZBoard was a beast — 25 pounds of wood, metal, and electronics sitting on relatively enormous wheels. That was part of its charm. The ZBoard Pro could tackle the toughest sections of New York City’s streets, which is no small feat. Rocks, sticks, and other debris can spell quick doom when you’re on a skateboard, more so when it’s motorized. And yet I remember &lt;em&gt;enjoying&lt;/em&gt; the snap of branches that dared sneak under the ZBoard Pro’s chunky wheels. That feeling made it worth lugging the colossal board around (and the built-in handles helped, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESG7Kq"&gt;What made the ZBoard special was that you controlled it using pressure-sensitive footpads embedded in the deck. It really, truly, took some getting used to accelerating and braking by shifting my weight. But the beauty of this control scheme was that it made riding the ZBoard eerily similar to riding a snowboard. For most people, I think Boosted’s hand remote is still the best electric skateboard controller made to date. I always thought ZBoard’s approach was more fun, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9xmBR"&gt;Boosted gets all the credit for establishing the electric skateboard market, and creating the best product. But the ZBoard Pro arrived on the scene at nearly the exact same time. In another universe, maybe the roles are flipped. In this world, ZBoard only made it far enough to develop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7494009/zboard-2-electric-longboard-indiegogo-ces"&gt;a second-generation board&lt;/a&gt; (smaller, lighter, but with the same control scheme) before it flamed out. Some people who preordered that newer board were lucky enough to get theirs, but most, it seems, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fzboard-2-the-most-advanced-electric-skateboard%23%2Fcomments&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22743937%2Ffavorite-gadgets-verge-staff-picks-10-years" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;never did&lt;/a&gt; — a shame, because the original board was truly unique. &lt;em&gt;—Sean O’Kane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7w3Cr6-z0n4uB8xpdVjTEcsgzF4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972188/HTC_Evo_3D___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="K4JvPE"&gt;HTC Evo 3D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yIvpMk"&gt;I’m pretty sure I’ve included this pick in at least one other list over the past 10 years, and I don’t care. I loved this phone. Not for the gimmicky 3D screen. Or the fact it came preloaded with Seth Rogen’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Green Hornet&lt;/em&gt;. Or because it was arguably another forgettable Android phone running version I-don’t-even-remember. Why did I love this phone? It had a very good button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EhztV0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/24/2509085/htc-evo-3d-review"&gt;The Evo 3D&lt;/a&gt; came with a two-stage camera shutter button. (And since there may be people at this point who have never used a traditional camera, a two-stage button works like this: you press it halfway to activate autofocus, and then all the way to snap the photo.) It was a perfectly-placed, circular metal button on the side of the phone with a 2D/3D photo toggle button next door. And it felt so good to press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAxHg0"&gt;Did the phone take good photos? Of course not. We’re talking about a 2011 Android device. It produced hot garbage by today’s standards. But… that button. I’ll never forget that button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZowpZ"&gt;The Evo 3D’s shutter button wasn’t just interesting because HTC dared to do something different as devices began converging on anonymous rectangle design. It was legitimately useful. Despite today’s advances in image stabilization and software processing, I still don’t feel totally comfortable having to tap the screen of my phone to take a photo or to tweak the focus. The genius of the shutter button on the phone was that you could hold the phone steady with two hands while still being able to manage focus and pick the right shot at the right time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XG8dL"&gt;Smartphones are incredible these days. They do so many things so well that improvements from year to year have become painfully incremental. But even the most advanced iPhone is still missing something. Give me that button. —&lt;em&gt;TC Sottek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/98sdfzqTSoc5v3BpV78c4sd8Oos=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972189/Tile___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="HXXNAg"&gt;Tile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DmnVw6"&gt;For my entire life, I’ve been losing things. In the last few months, I was tested for ADHD and found out my memory is less reliable than a bargain-brand cassette tape. But for nearly four decades, the only thing I knew is that I don’t know where anything is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dr11dF"&gt;If I put it down, it disappears — and in far too many cases, my wallets, keys, electronics, and other items vanished for good. After I had to replace everything in my wallet, again, a few years ago, I bought a couple of Tile’s Bluetooth trackers and the problem stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRcmKc"&gt;Even for me, completely losing an important item is rare, but getting stuck in the house because I can’t locate something important is an everyday struggle. Tile pretty much ended that, too, as suddenly my wallet and keys can speak up to announce their locations, even if the app’s ability to narrow down their hiding spot via wireless signal is questionable. Better yet, the Tiles themselves can find my phone, wherever it might be, like in the freezer, behind the couch, or outside, somehow. I’ve tried some other solutions I liked, too, but Tile’s the one that finally solved it for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKE77K"&gt;I think there are negatives to consider about the impact of tracking devices, whether made by Tile or others, when it comes to increasing waste and managing our digital footprint. Now there are some Tiles with replaceable batteries, but it’s not every model, and it doesn’t do much for millions of older units already out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnxaDy"&gt;With the release of ultra wideband trackers, range and precision are increasing to a whole new level, highlighting privacy and stalking issues that haven’t been fully addressed yet, too. It’s also annoying that Tile locks important features like unlimited sharing and location history behind a subscription — but I really can’t overstate the amount of time saved and peace of mind that these little trackers bring. —&lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ABu1y6"&gt;Fuji X100T&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OB56h0"&gt;I’m a video director and photographer here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s no surprise that my favorite gadget in the last decade would be a camera. But it might surprise you that it’s not a full-frame or medium-format behemoth, or even a massive cine camera. Rather, it’s Fujifilm’s tiny, retro-style, fixed-lens mirrorless camera — the Fuji X100T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDmIsM"&gt;Technically, this camera leaves a lot to be desired. The processor and the sensor both feel outdated. Noise handling isn’t all that good at higher ISO. Its fixed, non-removable 35mm-equivalent lens is a bit soft at f/2.0. There’s technically a video mode, but not much reason to use it. Fujifilm’s software has also improved greatly since this camera was first released in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaKSn3"&gt;All these things are kind of missing the point, though. For me, this was the camera that brought me back to loving the actual process of taking photos. Initially I was just looking for a secondary, lighter, non-intrusive camera to carry with me daily. I was won over by the X100T’s absolutely beautiful retro design, its hybrid EVF, its ability to simulate the colors of retro film and its deliberately restricting nature. I was totally sold on the idea of becoming the next Robert Frank (still waiting on that last part to happen).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqejxQ"&gt;But it did change my approach toward photography, made me slower and more deliberate with how I compose my images. It was the camera that convinced me to switch away entirely from my trusted Canon 5D Mark II (which I still kept for sentimental reasons) to mirrorless. I don’t use the X100T as much as I used to, but I bring it every time I visit New York City: There’s something very special about shooting around the city in the black-and-white film simulation mode.  —&lt;em&gt;Vjeran Pavic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="DenCtq"&gt;MiSTer FPGA retro console&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6b5yXt"&gt;I’m not sure if my growing obsession with classic video games over the last 10 years is a byproduct of the steady, unyielding passage of time, or if it’s a byproduct of some truly incredible advances in retro gaming technology… so let’s go ahead and agree on the latter and move on. From HDMI mods on everything from the NES to the Dreamcast, to the incredible clone consoles from Analogue, the retro gaming faithful are truly blessed. But there’s perhaps no greater blessing for me than the MiSTer project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUAtlq"&gt;Like I &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22640171/mister-project-classic-gaming-retro-fpga-board-chip-io-explainer-usb-hub"&gt;explained recently&lt;/a&gt;, “MiSTer is an open-source project designed to recreate the functionality of classic PCs, arcade games, and consoles as accurately as possible,” and it does this using FPGA (field-programmable gate array) technology. “While traditional CPUs are fixed from the point of manufacture,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc"&gt;Sam Byford explained&lt;/a&gt; in his own MiSTer story, “FPGAs can be reprogrammed to work as if they came right off the conveyor belt with the actual silicon you want to use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vV9MEw"&gt;While I still cherish my IKEA shelf full of consoles and my shelves full of games, I’ve increasingly found myself firing up my tiny little MiSTer when I want to play a classic game. While I can use an HDMI display, I most often default to the warm, irradiated glow of my Sony PVM CRT coupled with, well, almost any controller you can think of. I play &lt;em&gt;Gunstar Heroes&lt;/em&gt; on the Sega Genesis core, or recently, &lt;em&gt;TMNT&lt;/em&gt; on the Game Boy Advance core. I have an emulated 486 running everything from &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Loom&lt;/em&gt;. I have a hardware-accurate NeoGeo clone running games in crystal-clear 240p, truly a future that my 1990s teenage self could only imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9jDd3"&gt;Every week there is something new happening in the world of MiSTer, from new cores to cases to controllers. The MiSTer’s vitality encourages me to take the occasional break from whatever new release I’m playing to spend time with its progenitors — pausing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; to pick up the GBA’s &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, for example. But to my surprise, over time, I’ve found my attention falls more and more often to the MiSTer. —&lt;em&gt;Chris Grant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N239gjVSSPraZn6Ph_QtGHa4BpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972192/iPod_classic_160GB___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="CmaZV5"&gt;iPod classic 160GB&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2daR9Q"&gt;Sometimes, all I want to do is listen to my music in peace without seeing a trillion tweet notifications and new emails. That’s when I miss my iPod classic the most. With my iPod, if I wanted to shuffle through songs before falling asleep, I didn’t even have to look at the device. I could close my eyes and rely on actual buttons and the iPod’s comforting scrolling sound to shuffle through music. Now, I have to confront my phone’s blue light just to skip songs. Instead of being an escape, music sometimes sucks me back into doomscrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTPnGZ"&gt;I’m cheating a little bit with this entry, because the last iPod classic model came out in 2009. But I hung onto mine until at least 2014, when I moved from Southern California to New York City. Coming from a place with very little public transportation, the sound of subway cars’ clanging low-key terrified me when I first arrived. I could drown that out and pass the time during my commute with my iPod — without draining my phone battery, or having to rely on data, or finding underground Wi-Fi to stream songs. I didn’t realize I was lugging around a dinosaur until another commuter told me one day that he hadn’t seen an iPod like mine “in years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xme0kk"&gt;I should have taken it as a compliment. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s environmental reporter, I write about what a nasty problem e-waste is. The most eco-friendly choice you can make when it comes to picking a device isn’t buying a greener new device — it’s generally to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712435/recycling-e-waste-tech-plastic-pollution"&gt;keep the one you have until it’s dead&lt;/a&gt;. My iPod is, sadly, lost — probably in some box of sentimental crap I lug around with me whenever I move apartments. I can’t pinpoint exactly when or why I stopped using it. But if I ever find it again, I’d love to give it another spin. —&lt;em&gt;Justine Calma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sptQBXTWKhh0_i9-dyg_LOFEQ7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972193/Google_Glass___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="aGI6KM"&gt;Google Glass&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VFRHXA"&gt;I think most people would consider Google Glass to be an abject failure and certainly not worthy of my Gadget of the Decade. But not me. I think it’s a clear winner. Not because it was great (it definitely wasn’t), not because it was a brave attempt by Google to make a truly revolutionary device (though it was), but because it made me think differently about my approach to taking pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00Ksjp"&gt;Glass wasn’t just another iteration of a smartphone camera; this was a computer that you wore on your face! Which, of course, turned out to be not great from a self-esteem or privacy point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0j3Y6"&gt;The Google Glass Explorer Edition was announced in 2013. I immediately signed up and went to Google’s showroom in Chelsea Market in New York to part with my $1,500 to buy one. When it came to selecting the color, I opted for the Shale model as the one least likely to make me feel self-conscious. Unfortunately it didn’t work. As soon as I stepped into the street I felt like a complete jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xah7N"&gt;I felt so conspicuous that I soon gave up wearing Glass just for the hell of it. Instead, I became interested in using it as a still and video camera. I found taking photos without looking through a viewfinder or at a screen meant that the images were always slightly off from what I was expecting; it was like shooting with an extreme, exaggerated parallax. Being unable to accurately compose the photo, I was really just shooting a best guess. And I liked that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BybkPP"&gt;Of course the quality and resolution of Glass’s camera was bad — even for 2013. But to me that wasn’t the point. I liked the limitations. I appreciated that Glass forced me to think differently about how I was taking pictures in ways that using a smartphone never had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbNEM8"&gt;Yes, Google Glass was ultimately a failure as a consumer gadget. But it has had a lasting impact in how I think about new technology and the art of taking photos. —&lt;em&gt;James Bareham&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIEQJAhW3LGMOUpi3bkOVGsWpe8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972194/Finger_Magnent___color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="p9lPKF"&gt;A finger magnet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5xR8Rr"&gt;For about half the past decade, I had magnetic powers. I don’t anymore. It’s a long story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcsNen"&gt;I got a magnet&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/31/5952647/cyborg-conversion-incomplete-my-life-with-finger-implants"&gt; implanted in my finger&lt;/a&gt; back in 2012. The minor surgery was fairly common among&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/8/3177438/cyborg-america-biohackers-grinders-body-hackers"&gt; DIY biohackers&lt;/a&gt;: fans of physical augmentations like RFID chips, implanted headphones, and other futuristic “upgrades.” And it’s one of the most delightful things I’ve ever done. There is nothing in the world like being able to physically feel the fields around speakers and microwaves, pull loose screws from their housings with one finger, and impress strangers by performing minor telekinesis with paperclips and bottle caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uteoI"&gt;Unfortunately,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/21/15999544/biohacking-finger-magnet-human-augmentation-loss"&gt; this didn’t last&lt;/a&gt;. My working theory is that a coat of scar tissue slowly insulated the magnet until it couldn’t function; this is backed up by some advice from biohackers and also the permanently bruised swelling that’s bloomed on my fingerpad. I acknowledge that might sound off-putting, but I promise it’s painless. Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9sBjs"&gt;I’ve got no practical reason to keep the magnet now, just nostalgia. There was a brief period where emerging tech felt exhilarating, transformative, and within ordinary people’s control. For me personally, that period feels long gone. It’s been nine years; I’ve watched a lot of cool-seeming innovations flop or backfire or concentrate in the hands of a few companies that used them irresponsibly. Magnet powers and microchips are now the stuff of&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22516823/covid-vaccine-microchip-conspiracy-theory-explained-reddit"&gt; pandemic conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; — I can’t even joke about having &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; been magnetized, because I’m pretty sure someone would take it seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6Wkvr"&gt;The thing is, though, I’d do the surgery again without hesitation. I still consider getting another magnet, although you can’t easily swap a new implant into the same slot, so the threat of running out of fingers stops me. I browse&lt;a href="https://dangerousthings.com/"&gt; Dangerous Things&lt;/a&gt; to see if there’s anything neat I could get stuck under other parts of my skin. I want a fully implanted low-maintenance compass &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; very badly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W1Pw9"&gt;Lots of biohacking was never as high-tech as its proponents made it sound. But there’s something satisfyingly grokkable about its tiny, discrete pieces of hardware. And these days, in a complex and vastly networked world, casual fun feels hard to come by. —&lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WhJ9XUrhiChqmTrd4EeBQfs9SCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22972195/30_inch_Apple_Cinema_Display___Color.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Jpzlio"&gt;30-inch Apple Cinema Display &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="01HoXU"&gt;One of my favorite gadgets is also my oldest, faithfully serving me for over 16 years. I purchased Apple’s 30-inch Cinema Display with an incredible (for the time) 2560 x 1600 resolution for about $2,300 way back in early 2005. I didn’t need it, I wasn’t even employed at the time, but I wanted it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiNZiq"&gt;So, I bought the behemoth primarily out of spite at a very difficult time in my life, when things, I thought, would bring me more happiness than experiences. It’s now the single oldest piece of consumer tech in my house, yet I still use it every day. I feel pretty good about that in a culture and industry that promotes overconsumption as a virtue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhAI4"&gt;This Cinema Display was my only monitor when I began tech blogging on a PowerMac G5 back in 2005, it was there when I helped launch &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in 2011 from behind a MacBook Pro, and I’m looking at it right now as I type these words into my new Mac Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rta4jU"&gt;I wrote my first paid article on this monitor and it was here that I edited videos of my wedding and the photos of my daughter’s birth. Such intimate longevity has created emotional attachment, making it more than just a display. It’s a 30-inch totem that represents the through-line of my professional career and family life. How could I ever give it up? —&lt;em&gt;Thomas Ricker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dear Vergecast fans, thank you </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vergecast Logo lede image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4V3ZDmbHJrAnlkp0YwTeXENX-pA=/0x0:630x420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073615/The_Vergecast.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s been 10 years! You’re still here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eSnhoD"&gt;&lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has gone through many changes over the past 10 years — different studios, different platforms, different crews — but I am always surprised to see how many fans of the show have been around since the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lsAYL"&gt;At every live event we’ve done — most recently at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22606531/on-the-verge-event-tickets-date-time-nyc-10-year-anniversary-party"&gt;On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; in October — I’ve seen lines of people waiting to see the show in person, crowds around our hosts, and chuckles at inside jokes that haven’t been mentioned on the show in years. It’s still very wild to see, even after working on the show for almost six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfeY6m"&gt;When I started at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;as a podcast producer&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we were at the tail end of our run of the live video version of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, which we produced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVHdvAX5-R8y5l9xp6nroBQ"&gt;every week on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; before tossing the audio from that into the podcast feed. It’s funny that we still get requests to bring back the video version of the show — most recently at On The Verge. Nilay answered a question about this onstage at the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="n3chym"&gt;We are very convinced that editing our show makes us sound smarter. When we turned off the video feed, our downloads went way up. People like our show when we aren’t being idiots on video. We’re very good at video, I’m just pretty convinced I have a face for radio, so I’m just going to stick with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="56Q790"&gt;Listeners have also supported us experimenting with a lot of fun things in the podcast feed over the years, for which we are very grateful. From independent series like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20976885/pirate-radio-podcast-illegal-special-series-verge-afghan-djs-hmong-diaspora"&gt;Pirate Radio&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18177287/peter-tieryas-sci-fi-story-ar-augmented-reality-better-worlds"&gt;Better Worlds&lt;/a&gt;, our recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22672123/ai-voice-clone-synthesis-deepfake-applications-vergecast"&gt;AI series&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel"&gt;whole interview show that spun off into its own feed&lt;/a&gt;, our fans have been patient with us trying new things and sharing feedback on what they liked best. One of my favorites was when we made a one-off show in 2016 called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/13/12422710/verge-extras-podcast-binaural-3d-audio-1000-words"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1,000 Words&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which a listener said was “&lt;em&gt;easily&lt;/em&gt; the weirdest thing that you guys have done in the last 2 years.” We have more weird stuff coming, so stay tuned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vnh3mn"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2759113750&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ecyhjx"&gt;But the live shows are where we see the instant feedback, and there is no experience quite the same to us. Hearing fans shout “Cut through the night” or just “RCS,” or seeing &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Live&lt;/em&gt; T-shirts that we only made once really reinvigorates us each time and gets us excited to make more shows for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ctr1aH"&gt;So thank you to every one of you who has listened to and watched &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; over the past 10 years and over 500 episodes (I’ve lost count, but this week we’ll have our 474th Friday show), we literally could not have done it without you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cvAZyp"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Vergecast Live|104531" data-volume-uuid="59efaf866" data-volume-id="104531" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-893" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JFzHTk"&gt;We will do more live shows in the future, so we hope to see you in person again. In the meantime, here’s a recording of our &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Live&lt;/em&gt; at On The Verge for you to enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The unexpected health impacts of wearable tech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xzWvLSFazT04H5RwVPy_1Z2OtF0=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073513/VRG_ILLO_ANI_4841_10_Year_health_tech.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Micha Huigen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We didn’t realize how much doctors would be seeing of our health data&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rpWU8M"&gt;When Tim Cook took the stage at a September 2014 event to announce the hotly anticipated, long-rumored Apple Watch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6125873/apple-watch-smartwatch-announced"&gt;he described it&lt;/a&gt; as a “comprehensive health and fitness device.” The announcement set the foundation for what the company thought smartwatches and wearable devices would be — not just for fun, not just for notifications, but for your health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpMuzv"&gt;It was a big promise for a new, unproven product, made at a time when no one was quite sure what smartwatches were for or what they might be able to do. In the years before the Apple Watch launched, similar devices were steadily flooding the market. “It looked like the world would soon be awash in smartwatches. Samsung, Sony, LG, Asus, Motorola, Pebble, Meta — companies big and small attempted to find out what people want their wrists to do,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/7/7508197/ces-2015-smartwatch-war-apple-watch"&gt;wrote David Pierce&lt;/a&gt;, then the deputy editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. There didn’t seem to be a clear answer. Dan Seifert, who runs &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s reviews desk, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5284766/smartwatches-ces-2014-report"&gt;wondered in 2014 if there even needed to be&lt;/a&gt; an answer: maybe there could just be a range of watches, each with a different focus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1CEMkk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People were using the devices to monitor their health — and gradually, more started to bring that to their doctors  &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hN4ThB"&gt;At first, Apple didn’t appear to have a good answer, either. The company over-indexed on apps and communication, while its health features remained basic. The watch wasn’t smart enough yet and didn’t feel essential to a daily routine, Walt Mossberg said in one 2016 column. “It needs a capability more compelling than what’s out there so far,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/20/10795086/walt-mossberg-apple-watch-problems-smartwatch-future"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6Z43A"&gt;But Apple continued to sharpen its focus on fitness, and smartwatches became more and more popular. Sales for all smartwatches, not just Apple Watches, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/02/12/smartwatch-sales-in-2018-apple/"&gt;went up 61 percent&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. And their features started to fit more closely into the framework laid out by Cook in 2014. People were using the devices to monitor their health — tracking their heart rate, their steps, and their sleep. And gradually, more and more of them started to bring that information along to their doctors appointments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lKlI6"&gt;The permeation through healthcare is particularly noticeable in three areas: cardiology, sleep medicine, and sports medicine. Smartwatches made by Apple, Fitbit, Withings, Samsung, and other companies have features specific to each of those fields, and over the past decade, the devices became impossible for doctors to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7ZQ2C"&gt;“People come in and they have their device, and they’ve downloaded that data, and they want to show it to you,” says Matthew Ebben, a sleep specialist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. “It happens all the time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhogEw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;asked cardiologists, sleep doctors, and sports physicians how all of that data influences their interactions with patients. For better or for worse, they know it’s here to stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="rYiXUL"&gt;Cardiology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="8YPZRt"&gt;Four years after Cook called Apple’s smartwatch a health device, he was back to tout bigger claims: Apple Watches &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/13/tim-cook-david-rubenstein-show-interview/"&gt;could be lifesaving&lt;/a&gt;. The company announced that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/13/17855006/apple-watch-series-4-ekg-fda-approved-vs-cleared-meaning-safe"&gt;Food and Drug Administration clearance&lt;/a&gt; for an app that could detect irregular heart rhythms. The Apple Watch was now officially a medical device and was allowed to tell people that they might have a medical problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBi32X"&gt;The app was a big step for Apple, and a big step for smartwatches generally — soon after, Fitbit, Withings, and Samsung all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436090/fitbit-sense-ekg-heart-fda-clearance-apple-samsung-withings"&gt;added programs&lt;/a&gt; to detect irregular heart rhythms. Early on, though, many doctors were hesitant to embrace the tech. They told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18172132/apple-watch-ekg-electrocardiogram-health-science"&gt;were worried&lt;/a&gt; that there could be false positive readings that could push people to seek out unnecessary medical care, straining the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFfDul"&gt;Five or six years ago, cardiologists started to see a trickle of patients bring in heart rate data from smartwatches. But a few months after the FDA cleared the Apple Watch’s app in 2018, things changed. “People were watching ads and hearing Tim Cook say that it’s a lifesaving device. So we started getting a lot more of those patients,” says Mohamed Elshazly, a cardiac electrophysiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. “We have definitely seen an uptick in the last two to three years.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;An Apple Watch SE, from 2020, measuring heart rate.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfLPg"&gt;Elshazly remembers the first time he talked with a patient about their Apple Watch. Around four years ago, a man in his 60s — an active runner — came to see him after having occasional heart palpitations for a year. Other doctors hadn’t been able to offer a diagnosis because he hadn’t been wearing a heart monitor during any of those incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZBc6n"&gt;“Then I looked at talking to him, and I’m looking at his hand, and he’s wearing an Apple Watch,” Elshazly says. When the Apple Watch detects an abnormal heart rhythm, it prompts the user to use their index finger to take an EKG reading on the watch. The patient had followed those directions during one of the palpitations. Elshazly asked to see the patient’s phone, pulled up the health app, and looked at the reading. “It was atrial fibrillation,” he says. “So I was able to tell the patient, we have a diagnosis.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YxG1f9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They also let patients be more engaged in their own care.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZziDs8"&gt;Four years later, wearables are a regular part of patient visits. Sometimes, patients come into the office with readouts from their device that they want to show the doctor. Other visits are more like Elshazly’s first encounter with an Apple Watch — he spots a wearable on their wrist and asks about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miWPN9"&gt;In many ways, they’ve been helpful to cardiologists and their patients. Before, it could be challenging to diagnose people with heart conditions that cause abnormal heart rhythms, like atrial fibrillation. The conditions don’t mean someone’s heart is having problems all the time — it may flutter or feel strange for a moment before returning to normal. Doctors would send a patient home for a week or so with a heart monitor to try to catch one of the incidents. But if a flutter didn’t happen in that window, they sometimes resorted to surgically implanting a device in the patient’s chest to track heart rhythms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcbhgg"&gt;“It’s an invasive procedure and quite a bit more expensive than an Apple Watch,” says Byron Allen, a cardiologist and clinical professor at the University of California at Irvine. Wearable devices like the Apple Watch and Fitbits, which also have an electrocardiogram feature, make it easier for doctors to monitor patients at home. “They also let patients be more engaged in their own care,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WpdJUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;False positive Apple Watch readings “cause anxiety for the patient”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEP5Mf"&gt;Most doctors still wouldn’t actively recommend a cardiac patient go out and buy a wearable device as part of their treatment, Elshazly says — they’re still fairly new, and while most people have stories of times when they were effective, there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22463322/wearables-afib-apple-fitbit-doctor-visit"&gt;isn’t good comprehensive data&lt;/a&gt; on how much of a difference they make in public health overall. But if someone already has a device, doctors should make use of the data they offer, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BT2xjq"&gt;But there are downsides to the influx of wearable data, Allen says — those early worries about false positives proved valid. He estimates around a third of patients who come in worried about an Apple Watch notification have a false positive reading. “Those cause anxiety for the patient, and it takes quite a bit of time to sort through,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1zaKF"&gt;Doctors can also struggle to manage the sheer volume of heart rate and heart rhythm information wearable devices can collect. It’s not high enough yet to be entirely overwhelming, but it’s enough that cardiologists know they need to start figuring out how to sort through and manage it. “The engineers have been able to give us all this data, and create all these sensors for us,” Elshazly says. “Now it’s up to us to analyze that data and figure out how to make clinical sense of it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="jEREkm"&gt;Sports and fitness &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="BeRbIm"&gt;Liz Joy knows that more and more people are using smartwatches and other wearable devices as part of their health and fitness routines — tracking steps, monitoring their heart rate, and logging runs. But they don’t often bring them up at appointments, says Joy, a sports medicine specialist and senior medical director of wellness and nutrition at Intermountain Healthcare in Utah. “It doesn’t happen as often as you would think. Maybe 10 percent of the time,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiC0Bu"&gt;Joy thinks that’s because most people don’t think about the information collected by the devices as something they should bring up at a doctor’s appointment. “If you don’t ask, they’re not going to tell,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OckwOo"&gt;Most of the time, when the devices do come up, Joy usually uses it as an opening to talk about a range of topics: the amount of activity they do each day, any strength training they might want to incorporate into their routine, and so on. They can be helpful for people to keep tabs on the amount they’re moving around, even though they might not play a big role in someone’s nutrition or exercise programs. Many conversations aim to refocus people using activity trackers from the raw stats to how activity makes them feel and their overall goals, Joy says. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Fitbit Inspire HR, from 2019, supports swim tracking.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mG6kDh"&gt;Fitness and fitness-adjacent information, like step counts, was some of the earliest wearable data available. But it was often divorced from context — the main goal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10707108/new-mio-slice-fitness-tracker-announced-ces-2016-pai-score"&gt;was hitting a target&lt;/a&gt;, and that target could often be arbitrary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xay97p"&gt;“They say, ‘I try to get 10,000 steps a day.’ And I’ll ask them where they think that recommendation came from, and nine times out of 10, they have no idea,” she says. “There’s nothing wrong with getting 10,000 steps, it’s just that they don’t need that many to get health benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3PziKy"&gt;In some situations, though, the widespread use of wearable devices as fitness trackers can be dangerous — like for patients with eating disorders or obsessive-compulsive behaviors, who Joy also sees. “I’d say it’s more of a curse than a blessing with that group,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="O2yoqd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We talk about how to avoid tracking, because it’s not healthy for them. We want them to be more mindful.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9uz2SO"&gt;Dusty Marie Narducci, a sports medicine and eating disorder specialist at the University of South Florida, discourages trackers for those patients. “We talk about how to avoid tracking, because it’s not healthy for them. We want them to be more mindful, and try different activities — like, say, kayaking — rather than actively tracking their running,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7dc4e"&gt;On the opposite end of the spectrum are intense athletes, who tend to have the most intensive use of their smartwatches. Triathletes and ultramarathoners often keep close tabs on every possible metric, Narducci says. “There’s so much data that they come in with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yNrQy"&gt;But it’s hard to figure out what to do with that data. There’s no clear sign that the training and fitness information collected on a smartwatch or wearable devices can help people reach their goals faster or more effectively. Focusing on that information might actually make things worse, Narducci says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="clKwvq"&gt;“They’re always looking at their watch and trying to fix something. They spend so much time setting everything up or tracking it after, rather than focusing on why they’re exercising, or other things that might make them better performers,” she says. “You always have to ask yourself what you’re going to do with this data, and what time you’re taking away from other things to focus on it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="WtVUIo"&gt;Sleep medicine&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="z7rln3"&gt;When patients first started showing up to Seema Khosla’s office around 10 years ago with digital devices tracking their sleep, she wasn’t really sure what to make of it. “They would come in with their Fitbit, or I had one lady bring in her laptop,” says Khosla, medical director of the North Dakota Center for Sleep. “That was the reason they made their appointment, because their tracker said there’s something not quite right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6VGqG"&gt;Fitbit has monitored sleep since the earliest iterations of its devices — the clip-on Fitbit Classic, released in 2009, told wearers how much time they spent asleep during the night (or at least &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-10-15-fitbit-review.html"&gt;tried to&lt;/a&gt;). Garmin had early sleep features starting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5275344/garmin-jumps-into-the-fitness-tracking-market-with-the-vivofit"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, as well. When the devices first started to come on the market, Khosla says she probably had around one patient a month bring them in. “Now it’s easily ten a week,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QvxEMe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They say, ‘so, what am I looking at?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4jHOn"&gt;The trouble with the information offered by sleep tracking devices is that it’s hard for most people to know what to do with it. That’s just as true now as it was when the features were first introduced. The sleep features on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, which came out in 2020, aren’t that helpful, Dan Seifert wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368752/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;. “Wearable devices like this are missing a lot of the necessary context for what impacts the quality of your sleep,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UQEdY"&gt;That’s why people go see sleep doctors about their data, says Ebben, the specialist from Weill Cornell Medicine. “They say, ‘so, what am I looking at?’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ySVJtuhbsfUXl49uFCnuL3BwJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967893/jawbone_up_3_5274_2.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Jawbone Up3, which we reviewed in 2015, was supposed to track light, deep, and REM sleep.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYXEjG"&gt;At first, Khosla says she wasn’t quite sure what she was looking at, either. She rarely initiated conversations with patients about their wearable devices, and only discussed it when the patients brought it up themselves. “Now, if I spy a Fitbit on their wrist, I’ll ask about it,” she says. It functions as a patient engagement tool: she asks them why they track their sleep, what they think about the information it gives them, and how it makes them feel. It gives her a way to point out the importance of things like a consistent bedtime — if someone’s data shows that they go to sleep at a range of times, it’s a clear opening to raise the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIjjjQ"&gt;Devices offer more objective information than a sleep log, which doctors often ask patients to keep before a visit to capture their sleep patterns. “Inevitably they end up filling that out in the parking lot before the appointment,” Khosla says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a8wMeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ebben has started to notice a drop off in patients bringing in data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3w8uXD"&gt;But while sleep tracking features on wearables have improved over the years, they’re still not accurate enough to rely on entirely, Ebben says. They’re pretty good at figuring out when people are actually asleep during the night but aren’t as good at flagging when someone is awake. The various charts showing when someone is in deep sleep tend to be inaccurate, as well. It can be hard to treat someone with sleep issues if they’re fixated on data from a device, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEHukg"&gt;“They want to talk about what happened at 2:30AM on Thursday. We try to refocus on how they feel, if they feel like they’re waking up during the night — those are the things that are actually important to the person,” Ebben says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chM8Ux"&gt;Khosla says she’ll look at the information on deep sleep, particularly if the wearable has flagged something concerning. The varying accuracy, though, can make patients unnecessarily anxious, she says. She tries to keep tabs on the various devices so she can tell them what to expect. “You can tell them that theirs tends to underestimate wakefulness, or overestimate something else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="SlOcVy"&gt;People who use the devices seem to be starting to understand their limitations, Ebben says. After a surge in patients bringing in data, he’s started to notice a drop-off. “I think people are more aware that this is more entertainment than data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNfpl1"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968887/VRG_ILLO_ANI_4841_10_Year_health_tech.jpg" alt="video"&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/d999030794c60fc6b2dae276ba9cb939/VRG_ILLO_ANI_4841_10_Year_health_tech.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Launching myself into this decade’s space race</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s pure chaos&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="g2yPML"&gt;The same year that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; came into being, another decades-long program was coming to an end. In July 2011, NASA’s Space Shuttle Atlantis, with a crew of four on board, blasted off from Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, bound for the International Space Station. It was the last time the Space Shuttle would ever take flight — and the last time that people would launch to orbit from the United States for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ciPhY"&gt;I didn’t start covering space until after the Shuttle stopped flying, but the end of the program was still a pivotal moment for me. NASA’s workhorse spaceplane had been a major staple in my life ever since I was born. Both my parents had worked on the Space Shuttle program at Johnson Space Center for nearly the entirety of their professional careers, and for them, its termination was a huge loss. An end of an era. As I watched Atlantis’ wheels touch down on a Florida runway one final time on TV, I couldn’t help but feel that the US was throwing in the towel on human spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4oiHkT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like any respectable engineer, he made a PowerPoint presentation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhiA4o"&gt;Yet there were rumblings of new beginnings. During the last few years of the Shuttle program, when I was in college, my dad started experimenting with his own elaborate plan for returning astronauts to the Moon, just as a side project. He wanted to work on something that gave him hope for an exciting future in space. Like any respectable engineer, he made a PowerPoint presentation. And he showed it to the family... a lot. The plan relied on a mix of different rockets all working together to get people and fuel to space. Some of the vehicles were already operating, some still in development. One rocket he envisioned using was a vehicle I had never heard of before called the Falcon 9 Heavy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToTuHg"&gt;I can still remember looking over his shoulder at the computer in his office during summer break, as he pulled up the rocket maker’s website, this small company called SpaceX. He told me it was founded by the same guy who’d created PayPal, and that he thought this was somebody to watch. Mostly, he was impressed at the company’s low prices. NASA’s biggest weakness had always been exorbitant costs that always seemed to balloon, making it prohibitive for anyone but the government to afford launching to space. But SpaceX boasted incredibly low prices for getting cargo to orbit. He thought their cost structure would change everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DagI0h"&gt;After the 20th time of listening to his presentation, I promptly tried to forget about all of it when I went back to school. Back then, I had no idea that the PayPal guy would show up again — in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The last Space Shuttle flight took place in July of 2011.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Cv769R"&gt;There’s plenty to debate about whether the Space Shuttle program should have ended the way it did. But its conclusion certainly marked the beginning of a new era for NASA and the space industry at large. The Space Shuttle years embodied a time when the government was the primary gatekeeper to space, especially human spaceflight. In the years after Atlantis’ final flight, the world has seen private space companies leap forward in major ways. Notably, the rise of SpaceX from a bit player to a space behemoth changed the game. Just a year after the last Shuttle flight, SpaceX launched a cargo Dragon capsule to the International Space Station, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/20981714/spacex-commercial-spaceflight-space-industry-decade-nasa-business"&gt;the first time a private spacecraft had ever docked with the ISS&lt;/a&gt;. It was just the beginning of many more firsts to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCoUYr"&gt;It turned out that my dad was onto something. SpaceX’s focus on lowering the cost to get to space certainly played in its favor when securing NASA contracts and customers, and the company captured plenty of followers due to its lofty goals of reusing rockets and sending humans to the Moon and Mars someday. Though the company still clamors for government funding and sometimes makes bold predictions it doesn’t actually see through, SpaceX continues to defy expectations with each new accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Tenw0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Important human launches will take place in the middle of the night, billionaires will launch to space within weeks of each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ed4e9t"&gt;Myriad space companies have sprouted and started to mature since, all aimed at capturing something like SpaceX’s success. Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic are dueling to send tourists to the edge of space and back, while Blue Origin also hopes to launch people beyond Earth orbit and to the Moon. Satellite companies like Planet, Spire, OneWeb, and more have capitalized on technology miniaturization, creating satellites that are smaller than ever. And dozens of companies including Rocket Lab, Virgin Orbit, Astra, and Firefly, have created their own rockets to send those small satellites into orbit and beyond. Companies like Astrobotic and Intuitive Machines are working on their own robotic lunar landers, while others like Axiom and Sierra Space are building their own private space stations. Maxar and Astroscale continue to tinker with making satellites that can &lt;em&gt;repair&lt;/em&gt; other satellites already in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0VNhl"&gt;It’s a type of diversity that has made covering space an extremely intense and dynamic profession, very different from just a decade ago. When I did finally become a space journalist and started attending launches, I spoke with other reporters who had covered Shuttle during its twilight years. And I was a little surprised to learn that they found it to be rather boring. Every few months, the Shuttle would launch, and then it’d come back down. It was all pretty routine stuff. Compared to today, it was a much more predictable time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fr7a1P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We have to be ready, writing a post for success and one for all the possible ways a spacecraft can explode&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rXCWYx"&gt;Now, the space beat is a completely erratic profession. Important human launches will take place in the middle of the night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;billionaires will launch&lt;/a&gt; to space &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;within weeks of each other&lt;/a&gt;, Elon Musk will conduct rocket tests with just a moment’s notice, or the International Space Station will unexpectedly lurch and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22601752/russia-nauka-module-software-glitch-iss-space-station-nasa"&gt;spin out of control for a few minutes&lt;/a&gt;, sending mission controllers into a panic. It’s hard to know what to expect in just a week alone. In the meantime, NASA is still a constant dominating presence. The space agency continues to explore the cosmos with a plethora of robotic explorers, which fly off toward distant asteroids and planets, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21531060/osiris-rex-nasa-sample-pebbles-asteroid-bennu-escape"&gt;scooping up materials for scientists back home to analyze&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes those robots work — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633888/nasa-perseverance-rover-second-mars-soil-sample"&gt;sometimes they don’t&lt;/a&gt;. As journalists, we have to be ready for any manner of failure, often writing a post for success and one for all the possible ways a spacecraft can explode. And that doesn’t even touch on the periodic UFO mania that pops up like clockwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSZaAm"&gt;With the rise of SpaceX and other commercial companies, there’s certainly been an influx of enthusiasm from the public, eager to lap up any new innovative updates about our push into space. People will camp out in front of SpaceX’s test facility in Boca Chica, Texas for days and weeks, just so they can witness the construction of SpaceX’s next-generation rocket, Starship, in real time. Thousands of space lovers will tune into launch livestreams for every major takeoff, so they can witness the awe of a rocket igniting again and again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket takes off from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida in 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V2WNq5"&gt;Of course, there’s been the opposite kind of reaction, too. The prevalence of billionaires in the commercial space race has been nothing short of divisive. When Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson flew to space on their own rockets this summer, many saw the launches as the world’s most expensive vanity projects, while others pondered if there was something better they could have spent their money on. And not everything SpaceX does is met with joy. The company’s Starlink initiative, aimed at sending thousands of satellites into orbit to provide broadband internet coverage to the Earth, has been derided and chastised as polluting the night sky with artificial light, as well as creating a much more crowded space environment. Meanwhile, the problems we all continue to grapple with on Earth — sexual harassment, diversity and inclusion, and burnout to name a few — are still a problem in the space world, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="0KXCGc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When SpaceX launched its first astronauts, it felt like millions of people were watching along with me&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hahAjJ"&gt;But one thing that can’t be ignored is that private space companies are pushing boundaries in ways that many people thought impossible decades before, at least without significant help and oversight from NASA or the government. Nine years after Atlantis made its final flight, SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the space station, the first time a private company had ever sent &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; into orbit. More than a year later, SpaceX took it even further by launching four civilians to orbit; none of them were astronauts or military personnel. They were a tech billionaire, a cancer survivor, an engineer, and a professor. It was a gateway mission, proving that people don’t necessarily need to be NASA astronauts to see the curvature of the Earth from more than 300 miles up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIbjGN"&gt;As a reporter, it’s been wild to watch it all unfold and witness as space coverage blends into mainstream coverage more and more. When I first started reporting, I was used to being the lone person, staring at my computer screen, intently watching as each rocket took flight. Last year, when SpaceX launched its first astronauts, it felt like millions of people were watching along with me. When the launch got delayed at the last second, pushed to a few days later, my entire company collectively groaned in agony. It was fun to share that experience with them, one I’ve felt countless times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="YE42AO"&gt;The year 2011 may have seemed like the end of an era for space, but a new one has blossomed in the years since. I can only imagine what the next 10 years will bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F291wN"&gt;

    <title>The worst gadgets we’ve ever touched</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHe8FDBz2fSdmEHoLye7DQtA568=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073503/VRG_4808_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;h1 id="iYwNP0"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="o6mvPx"&gt;Over its 10-year history, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reviewed hundreds of products: smartphones that have changed the way that we communicate, take photos, and engage with the world; incredible laptops that pack the power of a gaming PC into a portable package; and consoles that have revolutionized how we play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAcgaB"&gt;These are not those products, though. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; turns 10, we’ve taken the time to look back at some of the highest highs of the world of consumer technology… but also the biggest duds that ended up on our desks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXRODC"&gt;Welcome to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s gadget hall of shame. Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcs56vQXxlDAnQR5dlFnj3ZND6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957596/hydrogenOne.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="TIDP2z"&gt;Red Hydrogen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="snmIcw"&gt;What else could top this list other than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18027782/red-hydrogen-one-review-all-hype"&gt;Red Hydrogen&lt;/a&gt;, which has the dubious honor of receiving the lowest review score &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever awarded? The phone was originally announced to breathless hype in 2018, with a list of specs so over the top, they almost sounded fictional. There was the “holographic display,” the promise of modular accessories that would drastically change how the phone could be used, and even the ability to pair the Hydrogen with Red’s cinema-grade cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIRy2h"&gt;But after months of delays, what actually shipped was a gigantic, painful-to-use smartphone with outdated specs, mediocre cameras, and an awful-looking, blurry attempt at glasses-free 3D that bordered on painful to use — all of this while costing an astonishing $1,300. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqkHux"&gt;The Hydrogen One was an attempt at making a unique kind of Android smartphone, but it only succeeded at making a uniquely terrible product from virtually start to finish: underpowered, overhyped, over-priced, late to market, and so bad that in its aftermath, the company’s founder decided it was a good time to retire and ended off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20931506/red-hydrogen-one-phone-project-canceled-founder-jim-jannard-retires"&gt;Red’s phone ambitions entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dyUyWvfwTrNKxpnb30CVph3UMUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957619/note.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="KZbefY"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Note 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sluPd3"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12491196/samsung-galaxy-note-7-review"&gt;Galaxy Note 7&lt;/a&gt; is possibly the best gadget on this list; a herald of the success of big-screened smartphones, packed with the latest specs, top-tier camera tech for the time, and superb design and hardware… except for the fact that it had a tendency to burst into flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzkPql"&gt;Yes, the Galaxy Note 7 is the phone that Samsung had to recall twice and never bothered to put back on sale again. We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; took the rare action of pulling its review score once it became obvious that buyers should steer clear. It was an important moment in smartphone history, a lesson for Samsung, and a good look at how even the most thorough reviews can’t account for every potential failing of a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrMJkd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TapWjKqvNn1f7AHk-3UKmMG0E2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957620/firePhone.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="n1YF3m"&gt;Amazon Fire Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p8pb3p"&gt;Unlike the Galaxy Note 7, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/22/5923697/amazon-fire-phone-review"&gt;Fire Phone&lt;/a&gt; did not literally light things on fire. But that’s one of the only positives about Amazon’s costly smartphone misfire, which marked both the start and the abrupt end of its smartphone ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9vDmR"&gt;Ostensibly an Android phone, the Fire Phone was Amazon’s attempt at translating the success of its Google-less Fire Tablets to smartphones, putting Amazon’s services front and center. Its claim to fame — other than its aggressive attempts to get you to buy things from Amazon — was a bizarre quadruple front-facing camera system that tracked your head at all times. The goal was to give you a “Dynamic Perspective” system by tilting and twisting your head around, which would supposedly enable a new way to interact with your phone. Unfortunately, it was more or less useless in practice, good for shifting icons around on a homescreen and little else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9N3G0"&gt;The lackluster software, over-reliance on Amazon’s services, and lack of apps (especially Google’s apps and its Play Store) all combined for a forgettable phone that wasn’t worth the trouble, landing the Fire Phone up on clearance in just a few short months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5lY46"&gt;Amazon hasn’t attempted a phone since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_iMdTSEubnXZvpsEt9MDTd6ZFSw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957622/ouya.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Eh9tpb"&gt;Ouya&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zr9p7t"&gt;Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony have dominated the console landscape for decades. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/4/4180242/ouya-review"&gt;The Ouya&lt;/a&gt; bravely asked if there was another option. What if there was a fourth console, an indie success, a crowdfunding darling that took Kickstarter by storm, that could expand the world of mobile gaming to the big screen? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cq2ExE"&gt;The Ouya, unfortunately, failed in those ambitions. It arrived not with a bang but with a whimper: unfinished, with too few games, not enough good games, awful software, and a dream that was too far ahead of its time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/15/5107416/towerfall-ascension-coming-to-playstation-4"&gt;The only real bright spot was &lt;em&gt;TowerFall&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been ported to other, actually good consoles — including the Nintendo Switch, which arguably succeeds at the sort of low-powered, indie success that the Ouya desperately wanted to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="log3aT"&gt;On paper, the Ouya had a lot going for it: an interesting Yves Behar design, an Arm processor (years before the Switch would take a similar tack), and big ambitions. But the Ouya was sold to backers (and customers) on a pile of promises and unfulfilled potential, of big things it &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; accomplish sometime in the future, if only it had the support, the time (and the money) to pull them off. But time was one thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/7/5478198/the-indie-game-console-may-already-be-dead"&gt;microconsoles like the Ouya&lt;/a&gt; didn’t have, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8782611/razer-acquires-ouya"&gt;Razer acquisition&lt;/a&gt; and a spiritual successor in the Forge TV couldn’t stave off the inevitable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RS3ikkz-EskNfMEQqTyerv35d6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957623/nexusJumbo.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2nU8ej"&gt;Google Nexus Q&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KxcdC3"&gt;Google makes a lot of great products these days: Nest speakers and Wi-Fi routers, the Chromecast, its Pixel phones. But the company’s first in-house device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/29/3125551/google-nexus-q-review"&gt;the Nexus Q&lt;/a&gt;, was not one of them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lEowq"&gt;What was the Nexus Q? All these years later, it’s still hard to pin it down. A bizarre media streamer that predated the Chromecast, the Nexus Q was given out to attendees at Google I/O for free ahead of what was supposed to be its grand debut — but then, after reviews (including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s) called out the shortcomings of the odd sphere, it was shelved entirely before ever making it to market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9bcoq"&gt;The Nexus Q was strangely useless as a standalone box: like the Apple TV’s AirPlay, content streamed to it had to be started on a different device — an idea that Google turned into the original Chromecast later on. But, unlike the Chromecast, which had a wide range of content and a small, dongle-shaped footprint that was easily concealed behind a TV, the Nexus Q only worked with Google’s YouTube, Play Music, and Play Video services and was a massive, melon-sized sphere that you had to somehow blend into your living room. Oh, and it was intended to cost &lt;em&gt;$299&lt;/em&gt;, which is an ambitious price point for a streaming box that &lt;em&gt;didn’t actually stream anything&lt;/em&gt; by itself.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn1v06"&gt;The Nexus Q is a valuable lesson, both of the power of a good gadget review and of how &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to make a set-top box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tleyBXwXwM9Eb5bDbxynTvMru3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957624/Xoom.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NJRjeT"&gt;The shitty early Android tablet trilogy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XEYSR0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/8/15/3243546/samsung-galaxy-note-10-1-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab Note 10.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WksZKb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/12/2627847/motorola-xoom-2-review"&gt;Motorola Xoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0fJlJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/12/15/2637324/verizon-droid-xyboard-8-2-and-10-1-review"&gt;Droid Xyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K96oXT"&gt;On February 24th, 2011, &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;’s Joshua Topolsky reviewed the Motorola Xoom, the first officially sanctioned Android tablet. Sixteen days later, he left to co-found &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, where we continued to review shitty tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGNuXP"&gt;Honestly, it was hard to pick just one terrible Android tablet to include on this list because there have just been so many. This trio, however, represents some of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s earliest forays into the pit of despair that was (and in many ways, continues to be) the state of Android slates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVufDK"&gt;It’s shocking to look back and see that Android tablets like the Xoom 2 were once considered contenders to Apple’s iPad lineup. Plenty of companies have tried, like Motorola (which certainly gave it its all), Samsung (which bravely still is trying to make the Galaxy Tab a thing), and even Google itself. None have managed to make much of an impact due to poorly designed operating systems and even poorer app support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDHOfj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s reviews have gotten considerably more polished since these early days. The same, sadly, cannot be said for Android tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nXSxl0wblVMne87cXQwLGs5hJic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957625/playbook.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="I0unKd"&gt;Blackberry Playbook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hrjffx"&gt;The BlackBerry PlayBook would have been an excellent place to close the book on BlackBerry’s chapter in the world of smartphones. An iPad also-ran that was meant to not only fight back against Apple’s tablets but also Android, which (in 2011) was still a young upstart steadily eating away at the market share that BlackBerry once held in mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuFXxs"&gt;The seven-inch PlayBook boldly tried to shore up BlackBerry’s place in the industry, establishing itself as a major player in the modernized, big-screen, and App Store-powered iOS and Android. Gone were the iconic physical keyboard and the email, calendar, and contacts applications — the main business-focused features on which BlackBerry had built its empire. Instead, the PlayBook offered a unique QNX-based OS and a smattering of basic games and media apps, which collectively turned the PlayBook into a smash success, catapulting BlackBerry back into the cutting-edge relevancy that it maintains to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkWeC2"&gt;Just kidding. BlackBerry’s utter failure at software and its attempt to launch a brand-new mobile OS and app store in late 2011 (an even worse start than Microsoft’s Windows Phone 7) doomed it before it began. Not even a hasty 2.0 software update to add Android apps could save RIM’s last, best shot at relevancy. The PlayBook was consigned to the scrap heap of history, along with BlackBerry’s good name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJLfOu"&gt;The PlayBook was the last major failure RIM’s BlackBerry would endure; despite some additional flailing, the BlackBerry brand was sold for parts and only persists today as a zombie-like licensed brand for companies like TCL, though even TCL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;doesn’t necessarily have the rights today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jidu2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Sr3Xwk"&gt;Microsoft Lumia 950&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fMGJz7"&gt;Oh, Windows Phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XircHb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/20/9767266/microsoft-lumia-950-review-windows-10-continuum"&gt;The Lumia 950&lt;/a&gt; was Microsoft’s swan song for flagship Windows Phone devices, released in the surprisingly late year of 2015 with “Windows 10 Mobile” on board. Microsoft had once dominated the pre-iPhone smartphone market with its business-focused Windows Mobile OS; but as Android and iOS gained momentum, Microsoft zagged where Apple and Google zigged, going off into its own direction with the stylish, blocky Windows Phone instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzlQXN"&gt;Microsoft definitely tried: it spent years reworking Windows Phone 7 (and its Windows Phone 8, Windows Phone 8.1, and Windows Phone 10 successors). It partnered with and eventually bought Nokia entirely to beef up its hardware chops, offering brightly colored flagship phones with unparalleled camera systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GIz3q"&gt;But it was all for naught. Microsoft just had too late a start, its also-ran app store practically empty of software. Despite its best attempts, developers just couldn’t be convinced to come over to the Windows side of things, and customers never really bought them. The Lumia 950 was doomed for the same reasons. Perhaps things would have been different if Microsoft had embraced Android apps years ago instead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;waiting until now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D71DTt"&gt;There were other Lumia phones after the Lumia 950, but its failure feels like the final nail in the coffin for an era of Nokia devices, Windows Phone, and Microsoft’s own smartphone ambitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kr30s"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cEIIob03qZB50-UVnx1ed4SKTrw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957632/butterflyKeyboard.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id="uCVQBq"&gt;That MacBook keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efykEE"&gt;&lt;small&gt;(butterfly keyboard, 2015-2020)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZsiDK"&gt;You know the one. As part of Apple’s 2010-era sprint toward making its devices as slim and sleek as possible, damn the consequences, the butterfly keyboard’s badness crept up on users the same way that writer John Green once described falling asleep: “slowly, then all at once.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEylBg"&gt;The thinner, crisper keys weren’t bad at first: an adjustment compared to Apple’s old scissor switches, sure, but not inherently better or worse. But as time went on, the butterfly switches turned out to be as frail and fragile as their namesake. The switches could jam, clog, or break entirely at the hint of the merest presence of dust or debris; attempting to remove the caps to fix them would usually just make things worse, shattering the delicate plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuyBfU"&gt;Sadly, we were unable to review the MacBook’s butterfly keyboard (circa 2015 through 2020) as an independent piece of hardware. The god-awful design had the good fortune to be attached to otherwise great computers and &lt;a href="https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life"&gt;avoided widespread detection&lt;/a&gt; for a time; nevertheless, Apple’s keyboard mistake stands out as not only one of the worst pieces of hardware of the last decade but one of the most widespread. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SsFKov"&gt;Apple would try and try and try again to fix the butterfly keyboard, with new membranes to stop dust and tweaked designs over the years, but eventually, the only solution was the obvious one: go back to the old, thicker keys and pretend the whole thing never happened (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634247/macbook-butterfly-keyboard-problems-apple-repair-new-materials"&gt;except for an expanded repair program&lt;/a&gt;, that is). Whereas many of the devices on this list lived and died short, niche lives, Apple inflicted the butterfly keyboard on millions of customers for years, giving it the dubious distinction of causing the most tangible badness of anything we’ve ever reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="NflDKB"&gt;Every technological product that Will.i.am touches:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wvdTOP"&gt;Will.i.am is good at music. Great at music, even (who doesn’t love blasting some classic Black Eyed Peas bops?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9lmkb"&gt;The same can not be said about his varied and horrible forays into consumer technology, which are, simply put, terrible. Like a reverse Midas, everything that Will.i.am’s startup touches turns to coal: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13498530/will-i-am-bluetooth-earbuds-headphones-buttons-kendall-jenner"&gt;oversized earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/will-i-ams-extremely-illegal-delorean-impounded-by-poli-5919274"&gt;an illegal car&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/5/7162861/will-i-am-puls-smartwatch-is-terrible"&gt;Puls smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; (“the worst product I’ve touched all year”), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932055/wink-smart-home-problems-iamplus-william-black-eyed-peas"&gt;the Dial smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; (because one wasn’t enough), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16054856/smart-home-platform-wink-acquired-will-i-am"&gt;smart home platform Wink&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932055/wink-smart-home-problems-iamplus-william-black-eyed-peas"&gt;which nearly ran out of money&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21256986/wink-paid-subscription-delayed-may-20-smart-home-platform"&gt;straight into the ground&lt;/a&gt;), a line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/28/3703286/will-i-am-iphone-camera-cases"&gt;overpriced iPhone cases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVaO36"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has technically never reviewed a finished Will.i.am product — largely due to the fact that most of them did not pass muster to get to that point — but the ones that have crossed our path are excessive, gaudy, and just plain bad products that no one should ever have bought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBbWYJ"&gt;I’ve gotta feeling he should maybe stop trying to make consumer electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
