    <title>This company is making digital humans to serve the metaverse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEOhZQx3fGu6aNt8nSIllFsMJi8=/0x0:1347x898/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052176/unnamed.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Meet Sam&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yqYUAF"&gt;In a stark white browser tab, Sam — a young blonde woman with perfectly shaped lips — asks me for the solution to 2+2. I immediately think of the infamous &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; episode&lt;/a&gt; in which a tortured Captain Picard is shown &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk3EsXgXcyQ"&gt;four lights&lt;/a&gt;. If he admits there are five lights, the ordeal will stop. “There are &lt;em&gt;four &lt;/em&gt;lights!” Picard shouts defiantly. Of course, I’m not being tortured. I’m at home, staring at the future face of the metaverse and trying valiantly not to think about memes from a TV show known for its exploration of ethics and humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9nnB2"&gt;Sam isn’t a real person — she’s a digital human created by Auckland-based tech company Soul Machines. Designed to have &lt;a href="https://hello.soulmachines.cloud/session"&gt;a short conversation with visitors&lt;/a&gt; about herself, she runs on a proprietary “digital brain” and studies my expressions via webcam. At one point Sam asks me to smile but can’t seem to register my biggest, brightest “cheese.” I wonder if I’m just bad at emoting. When she asks if I know what autonomous animation is, I respond “No, but you’re about to tell me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amcN4D"&gt;“Good answer!” Sam chirps. “You should come and do my job!” She then explains that it means her speech and action aren’t pre-recorded — she can respond to every moment like a natural interaction. Digital people running on Soul Machines’ dystopian-sounding &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjclQ3m5JRw"&gt;Humans OS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; can use their hands and will one day be able to use full-body motions. “Does that make me more relatable to you?” she asks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kcpxhy"&gt;When we think of the metaverse, popularly depicted as a game-like virtual environment where humans use avatars to live, work, and play, we’re often the main characters. But it’s Soul Machines which will be filling the metaverse with what co-founder Greg Cross refers to as a “digital workforce” — a stream of bespoke Sams who will form the equivalent of NPCs in nascent digital worlds, as well as extensions of ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMvTvN"&gt;“When we’re playing a game, we adopt a certain persona or personality, when we’re coaching our kids’ football team we adopt another persona, we have a different personality when we’re at the pub having a beer with our mates,” Cross explains. “As human beings, we’re always adjusting our persona and the role we have within those parameters. With digital people, we can create those constructs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="zJdSXn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjclQ3m5JRw?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=52&amp;amp;start=52" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Iu3EY"&gt;Right now, Soul Machines mostly makes digital people for customer service and &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/industries/public-sector/"&gt;public outreach&lt;/a&gt;, but they’ve also worked with &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/industries/entertainment/"&gt;will.i.am&lt;/a&gt; and Carmelo Anthony; in will.i.am’s&lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/technology/#popmake-35642"&gt; short promotional video&lt;/a&gt; for his digital twin, the Black Eyed Peas rapper observes a pimple that Soul Machines replicated on his face. The company has digital people repping the World Health Organization, Maryville University, Westpac bank, the New Zealand police, and SK-II skincare. Ruth is a &lt;a href="https://cookiecoach.tollhouse.com/"&gt;digital baking coach&lt;/a&gt; who works for Nestle. The company has been doing this for years, starting with &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/resources/research/baby-x/"&gt;BabyX&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 — a prototype AI that remains the core of its research arm. Cross’ co-founder is engineer Mark Sagar, who had an Oscar-winning digital effects career in Hollywood (including a stint at Weta Workshop) before returning to the &lt;a href="https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/engineering/community-engagement/alumni/alumni-stories/mark-sagar.html"&gt;University of Auckland&lt;/a&gt; to create BabyX, which is modeled after his daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFdEFT"&gt;There are naturally other players in the digital person industry, like the &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/this-startup-is-launching-a-new-ai-media-lab-to-create-human-avatars-for-brands/"&gt;AI Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (AIF) which also boasts a mixed team of scientists and entertainment veterans, including AI-driven game creator Lars Buttler (Trion Worlds), visual effects artist Rami Hachache (creator of fake Quibi celebrity &lt;a href="https://www.today.com/popculture/who-kirby-jenner-new-parody-hilariously-spoofs-keeping-kardashians-t182400"&gt;Kirby Jenner&lt;/a&gt;), and Hollywood executive Joe Drake from Lionsgate. AIF’s website offers even less insight into the nuts and bolts of their tech, aside from a similar general message about “bringing the potential of AI to everyone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Ya6YuK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10828437"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lnuSTv"&gt;Soul Machines stands apart for two reasons. Through Sagar’s groundbreaking research, it’s a pioneer in bringing hard neuroscience to the art of creating digital humans, which are a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRyM52GQ7Ks"&gt;staple part&lt;/a&gt; of the Hollywood special effects arsenal. Second, it’s already got digital people working in the field with “teachable” digital brains borne out of the work done with BabyX, who is now a toddler; the company can’t release a full list of its digital laborers without each client’s consent. Yet, poring over the company’s white paper doesn’t yield much more than an extended summary of how the digital brain animates cutting-edge CGI to allow its digital people to adapt to real-time interactions. At the moment its digital people still require guidance from a human “trainer.” Soul Machines’ end goal is to teach a digital person how to make goal-based (and one day, value-based) decisions, which is still a long way off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="drQiwL"&gt;“At some point in the future,’ says Cross, “you might be able to create a digital version of yourself or multiple versions of yourself, and they can go out and do stuff, make money for you, make money for your company, while you’re doing something else that’s a whole lot more fun.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0vEPu"&gt;My first thought is that this is going to be an absolute field day for MMORPG botters farming for resources. But Cross goes on to suggest using a digital person to play a game like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;. “Those types of digital people are what we call human-enabled or human-driven digital people, they’re mimicking — they’re under the instruction of real people,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFUb6G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; is a curious choice. It’s a skill-based multiplayer game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261947/call-of-duty-warzone-cheaters-hackers-aimbots-wallhacks-problem"&gt;where cheating is an open problem&lt;/a&gt;, and one where bragging rights hinge on having flesh-and-blood opponents. “A large part of the appeal of multiplayer games is playing another human, and knowing that you are matching wits and reflexes with another human brain,” says &lt;a href="https://www.markrjohnsongames.com/"&gt;Mark Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, who studies digital culture and emerging forms of labor at the University of Sydney. “In this regard I’m not sure how digital people would be different from just a really strong AI ... and while those are interesting, it’s telling how little people play against AIs when human players are available, no matter how savvy the AI competitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZOZv1"&gt;Most MMOs don’t allow bots or third-party services; historically, one of the most straightforward ways to identify a botter in &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; was to strike up a conversation with a suspicious player and see if they would respond like a real person. “There are many obvious reasons for these sorts of rules and ‘digital people’ would massively upset these and force us to profoundly rethink ideas around play, work, fairness, the use of our time,” Johnson adds. “If it’s just a competitive multiplayer game, or even a single player game, the entire point is to play the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4v2x8I"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvX71Y_MDGc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BPGPfe"&gt;Beyond games, Soul Machines has loftier aspirations for its digital people, which starts to veer toward the kind of excitable Panglossianism that colored the early internet years. Cross is quick to clarify that Soul Machines wants to do good, and the company has publicly stated that it &lt;a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/300321814/it-can-be-used-incredibly-badly-ai-developer-soul-machines-will-ban-politicians-from-creating-digital-twins"&gt;won’t let politicians use its services&lt;/a&gt; to avoid amplifying extremism. “It’s important that companies and people learn from each generation of technology we’ve created and think about how we want to do things differently going forward,” Cross says, pointing to healthcare and education as classic examples where infrastructure and resources are a problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ImtDa"&gt;“We don’t see digital people replacing healthcare professionals and teachers, we see a means to augment and amplify them,” Cross says. “We just don’t attract people into those positions at that moment based on what we’re prepared to pay them.” Where a less advantaged person may not be able to afford one-on-one time with a doctor or teacher, Soul Machines’ digital people — each programmed and trained in the relevant field and deployed at scale — would theoretically allow anyone to experience a greater degree of personalized care (which still requires an internet connection and webcam). He goes on to explain that in a hypothetical banking situation, users might feel more comfortable talking to a digital person about their personal finances. “We have a lot of hard data now that there are many people in many interactions who prefer to speak to digital people over real people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kEQhOU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are unable to replace human teachers who have a monopoly on knowing how to be human.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hSd2wI"&gt;Virtual and augmented reality are already being used in teaching environments, but the idea of using digital people to supplement a uniquely messy human experience is understandably controversial. “Our children learn how to be social, emotional, ethical, complex, ambiguous creatures in the world partly by watching what the adults in their lives model for them — and they are watching teachers for something like 30 hours per week for 12 years of their life,” says &lt;a href="https://nickkellyresearch.com/"&gt;Nick Kelly&lt;/a&gt;, who specializes in design education and cognition at the Queensland University of Technology. He acknowledges that technology can improve schooling, but it’s a complex issue, and the idea of students using AI isn’t inherently dangerous.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HF0g1"&gt;“It doesn’t matter how well animated the ‘digital person’ is, how high their resolution is, or how well-programmed they are to provide ‘individual attention,’ they are unable to replace human teachers who have a monopoly on knowing how to be human — now and in the foreseeable future,” Kelly explains, pointing out the dangers of having a for-profit company, working with governments, to determine the shape of entire education systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXXf6R"&gt;Introducing digital people into the healthcare system, especially given &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy-technology"&gt;tech’s notoriously poor issues with digital privacy&lt;/a&gt;, offers a whole new set of problems, like whether it’s ethical to let users choose how a digital worker looks or behaves. Soul Machines’ Humans OS 2.0 platform can &lt;a href="https://www.soulmachines.com/human-os-platform/"&gt;create a digital person in real-time&lt;/a&gt;; at &lt;em&gt;best &lt;/em&gt;this means a Black user might feel more comfortable speaking to a Black digital person, and at worst it could mean that racists could opt for an artificial environment of white customer service. Women would be able to choose to speak to a female-presenting digital person about bra fittings or puberty problems, which could theoretically be nice for teens who don’t want to do that with a parent. But these options, for all their business-centric benefits, could potentially feed existing prejudices and create a false sense of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3pWPXY"&gt;This new digital workforce would also operate under a specific set of conditions. “When we create a digital brand representative for a big enterprise, of course, they’re not going to have the ability to express negative emotions,” Cross explains. “We’re expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the values of that particular role.” It’s a troubling standard when you consider how Big Tech dehumanizes its workers today, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/may/26/amazon-workers-are-rising-up-around-the-world-to-say-enough"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; leading the pack. While digital humans don’t need rest (or basic compassion), a corporate “positive vibes only” mandate means changing the way we perceive and interact with “customer service” even as it wears a human face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8KKl7"&gt;“People are more aware of what data is getting captured and how it’s getting captured and how it’s getting used,” Cross says when I ask him about ethics of metaverse construction, especially in the wake of an era when Google once bore the slogan “don’t be evil.” “Every wave of new technology has been used to make a huge difference in the world, in terms of productivity, democratization, our ability to travel... technology has always been used by most of us to do incredibly good things and by a few of us to do the things that aren’t very nice or simply plain evil. That is a reflection of the human condition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCqrg3"&gt;It’s an interesting ideal to hold up in an age where Facebook is being rightfully pilloried as an &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/10/26/indisputable-harm-caused-by-facebook/"&gt;“indisputable” source of harm&lt;/a&gt; to its millions of users, especially when you consider its origins as a glorified “hot or not” for Mark Zuckerberg’s fellow Harvard students. Over at &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, Ian Bogost points out that tech-driven metaverse buildup is very much “&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-name-change/620449/"&gt;a fantasy of power and control&lt;/a&gt;” that twists and romanticizes a sci-fi concept into an equally twisted escape route for billionaires who don’t need to contend with the reality of their capitalist legacies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EKf0Z5dWpoTSjNxCGY6Z2haVGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956494/unnamed_1.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GVd02E"&gt;As we wade into more metaverse hype, it’s clear that companies like Soul Machines will be filling in customer service gaps across every industry, from games to healthcare. In fielding my questions, Cross exudes the serene patience of a man who knows that his work will take years, if not several decades, to really take off. “I would argue that the human touch is already being lost (something we see as accelerating),” he says in a follow-up email, pointing to the rise in transactional apps like the kind we see in online banking. “This is exactly why we see empathetic customer experiences as being a very important part of connecting with people in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwdep5"&gt;But if digital people are going to form the backbone of this bold new universe that transcends the physical world, their evolution in games should invite the same level of scrutiny as it would in other areas like healthcare and education. Gaming isn’t just something you do to kick back and relax anymore — it’s a billion-dollar industry with whole ecosystems of developers, artists, producers, voice actors, QA professionals, marketers, and streamers. Microtransactions, “gamblification,” and pay-to-win features are often a big part of multiplayer and mobile games. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s in-game purchases, for instance, reflect a very specific vision of a functioning metaverse economy that relies on cosmetic skins and topical pop culture. Big games are a distinctly corporate machine, and using digital people to humanize an already hyper-aggressive capitalist environment could have dire social and cultural consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afv1Ev"&gt;“The ‘blockbuster’ games industry has not exactly been renowned in recent years for its ethical practices, whether we’re looking at microtransactions, games as a service, loot boxes, skin betting, or whatever else,” says Johnson. “All of these phenomena have brought along major ethical questions that are only now really beginning to be interrogated and dealt with (research and legislation always, sadly, come after new developments) ... I honestly can’t believe the big-money parts of the games industry are going to do anything ethically, frankly, unless they explicitly prove to us otherwise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DGPvEN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A digital workforce has more utility as the metaverse evolves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mjzJZq"&gt;Soul Machines’ work also raises questions about how digital people would work across different metaverses in an industry where console companies are notoriously insular; for instance, if you had a digital person assistant, how would they traverse seamlessly through different game franchises and IPs and retain a sense of continuity? How would a simulated human presence affect our relationship with games as a fantasy escape, a livelihood, a relaxing hobby, or all of the above? What kind of tensions would arise in the gaps between people who can afford digital personae and those who can’t or won’t use them? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="033oMT"&gt;Limiting digital people to NPC roles seems a benign enough start. “Creating big multiplayer games is a huge cost. It’s a huge amount of investment … all of the different animations, and all of the different scenarios that could play out,” says Cross. “What we’re looking at in autonomous animation is digital people that can respond in real time based on what they see, what they hear, and what’s going on around them.” He offers an example — creating more adaptable villains to create a more lifelike sense of immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl8F94"&gt;While digital people aren’t murderous terminators here to take over the world, they’re already being used as a building block in our slowly (but surely) evolving new meta-world. “A digital workforce has more utility as the metaverse evolves, as it becomes an economy or a series of economies and industries and businesses,” Cross says. “So that’s why we think the sort of animation that we’re doing, the autonomous animation we’re doing with digital people is really, really going to be a core piece of metaverse construction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EaxS3e"&gt;If we’re thinking about a workforce in terms of sheer utility, it makes sense to use the hell out of an omnipresent AI with the capacity to simulate human behavior. But given the cost of reaching that point — a distant point where digital people are indistinguishable from the real deal — it seems like they can only be used to turn profits, as vehicles for capitalism on steroids. Examining digital people raises a mirror to our own faces, of what we want to see in our workforce and labor and how we see those doing the same work right now. I probably won’t be alive to see Soul Machines reach the peak of its journey, nor will Cross, but something tells me Sam — at least a small part of Sam — will. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Music officially launches on the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuU-7Cr-UMxNhdtSzswTipThzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70052084/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uOoQoN"&gt;Apple Music is coming to a gaming console, and it’s &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/27/apple-music-launches-on-ps5-today/"&gt;the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;. The new app lets Apple Music subscribers stream music on Sony’s latest console, similar to what was already available with Spotify. Audio can play in the background while you’re gaming or just play on its own. Instructions on how to set up Apple Music for your PS5 are available &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/set-up-apple-music/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Music running on the PlayStation 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oiom00ANabhzFV9dcfx3zw2ePHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959764/FCtqOYEWYAkJdCy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Music running on the PlayStation 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LN1ATV"&gt;This is the PS5’s second major integration with an Apple service; both Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528372/ps5-streaming-apps-support-day-one-netflix-disney-plus-twitch"&gt;launched with the Apple TV Plus app last year&lt;/a&gt;. Sony extended the partnership to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588577/ps5-sony-apple-tv-plus-six-month-trial-subscription"&gt;six months of free Apple TV Plus membership&lt;/a&gt; to PS5 owners earlier this year. Having Apple Music on a console is a nice addition if you’re looking to simplify your TV setup and avoid having to switch too much between dedicated streaming boxes and built-in apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VmYJa"&gt;News of the PS5’s Apple Music app emerged after a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleMusic/comments/q68jxg/since_when_was_this_a_thing_i_made_a_new_account/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link"&gt;Reddit user spotted&lt;/a&gt; the streaming service in the console’s music menu, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; was subsequently able&lt;/a&gt; to get the icon to appear by creating a new account. Apple Music is also available on Android, Amazon Echo, Chrome OS, Sonos, the web, and of course, Apple’s own range of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram’s link stickers are rolling out to everyone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8gN_hpooJKLMGZzt-nKZFqXAu8=/0x1:1619x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051991/Link_Sticker.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stickers appear in Stories posts, and can link out to external sites.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t9sdHS"&gt;Instagram’s link stickers, which let you include hyperlinks in Stories in the form of stickers, will now be available to everyone on the platform, the Facebook-owned social media network has announced. Instagram started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555434/instagram-link-sticker-post-test-swipe-up"&gt;testing link stickers in June&lt;/a&gt;, but until now the feature has been limited to verified accounts or accounts with a large number of followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eBiZL"&gt;According to the social network, link stickers are useful for anyone from businesses linking out to their products to activists linking out to external resources. But Instagram concedes that anyone can benefit from link sharing to engage with their followers. It also says that accounts repeatedly sharing misinformation or hate speech will lose access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MJpYtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The successor to the swipe up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CbVmX4"&gt;To add a link, head into the sticker tool from the top navigation bar after uploading content to your story, tap the “Link” sticker and enter the desired URL. It then functions like any other sticker on a Stories post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuBMW5"&gt;When it announced the link stickers feature in June, Instagram stressed that they’re only meant for Stories posts and said it had no plans to bring them to the main Instagram feed or other parts of the app. That remains the status quo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NkM9L"&gt;The link stickers feature has now entirely replaced “swipe up,” which was how Instagram users could previously link out to external webpages from their Stories, and which the platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638222/instagram-swipe-up-link-sticker-roll-out"&gt;discontinued in August&lt;/a&gt;. But with today’s news, link stickers are now more widely available than swipe up ever was, since the old feature was only available to verified accounts or accounts with more than 10,000 followers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Frame TV is $300 off at Best Buy and Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DERJFJYLB90n_s7VXEWdkTl4EKg=/0x405:4194x3201/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051724/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a limited time, Samsung’s 55-inch, art-inspired QLED is down to $998, its best price to date.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3bphup"&gt;Nobody will deny the unique appeal of the Samsung Frame TV, which you can currently find at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $300 off its original MSRP. While the price is a bit steep for a 55-inch 4K TV, you’re really paying for the aesthetics and the QLED panel. When removed from its stand, the Frame TV is virtually indistinguishable from a framed piece of artwork on the wall, even going so far as to include an ambient art mode that’s designed to transform the HDR TV into a piece of decor rather than a passive appliance. The 2021 model offers some impressive specs as well, including support for Amazon’s Alexa, four HDMI ports, a 120Hz refresh rate, and the Tizen smart platform, which enables access to most major streaming services without the need for a Roku or other streaming device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gdDmER"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PAZ45N"&gt;The Logitech G903 Hero, one of the best gaming mice on the market, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Rechargeable-Compatible-Ambidextrous/dp/B07NSVMT22?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to just $100 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching its best price to date. Sporting a 25K DPI sensor and a customizable layout allowing for up to 11 programmable buttons, this ambidextrous mouse left very little on the cutting room floor in terms of features. It features remarkable battery life but is also compatible with the Logitech Powerplay system, allowing you to wirelessly charge it using either the Powerplay mat or a third-party magnetic dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f3WAgd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="MiDpfq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752982"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="82lWMb"&gt;The original entry in the Microsoft Surface line of laptops has &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;just drop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744986485173030337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ped to $550 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. One of our biggest issues with this laptop when we originally reviewed it was the steep price point for otherwise underwhelming specs. This deal, however, makes the Surface Laptop Go far more palatable. While far from cutting-edge, this laptop can still hold its own with a 10th Gen Intel Core i5 CPU and integrated UHD graphics. This configuration comes equipped with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but this discount also extends to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSmp2trFHm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; which has been reduced to $700. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21512680/microsoft-surface-laptop-go-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mwKhl7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuVWfv"&gt;Another excellent OLED deal from Vizio, the 55-inch version of the H1 series is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,000 at Best &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724588595468253653#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Buy&lt;/a&gt;. A 4K panel paired with a 120Hz refresh rate makes the H1 great for gaming, and the SmartCast platform grants access to most streaming services while HDR10 Plus compatibility offers an incredibly vivid picture. For connectivity, the H1 series includes a total of four HDMI 2.1 ports and a single USB port for powering external devices like a Roku Streaming Stick 4K. This particular model even includes composite video and optical audio inputs, and it supports AirPlay 2 alongside virtual assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1XSJsJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9549851"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTT7ef"&gt;If your PlayStation 5 is already running out of space, the 1TB version of the WD Black SN750 is currently available for $120 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfRZge5hJKF#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;uy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Black-SN750-NVMe-Internal-Gaming/dp/B07M64QXMN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, half off its original MSRP. This M.2 SSD offers solid transfer speeds at 3,470MB/s, which helps cut down on load times, and the compact form factor makes for simple installation whether you need the extra storage on a PC or console. If you’re planning on upgrading the storage on your PS5, however, keep in mind that you’ll also need to install your own heatsink alongside the SN750.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Xz2aZO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use the PS5’s M.2 SSD expandable storage ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"},{"title":"The PS5 SSD buying guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="vxQC8J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AlhLOb"&gt;A battery pack, charger, and adapter, the Anker PowerCore Fusion is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CPGM7TH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for an all-time low of $25 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; with the promo code &lt;strong&gt;ANKR1622J21&lt;/strong&gt;. Our reviewer, Dieter Bohn, liked the sturdy design and how it consolidated the number of gadgets he needed to tote around. This battery pack shares a similar size to Apple’s 87-watt adapter and has both USB-A and USB-C ports to access the 5,000mAh battery. Just beware of the comparably low 30-watt limit on this charger, which isn’t sufficient to provide enough juice for more powerful portables like the MacBook Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18306269/anker-powercore-fusion-usb-c-power-delivery-battery-charger-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMJejQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10658582"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wzbLrC"&gt;We’re not done yet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3araDp"&gt;The PS5 version of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, the first game to make &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Andrew Webster risk his life for an audio log, is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html%3Futm_source%3Drakutenls%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3DGameSpot%26utm_campaign%3D10%26utm_kxconfid%3Dtebx5rmj3%26cid%3Dafl_10000087%26affID%3D77777%26sourceID%3DVZfI20jEa0c-EquovOwsU9XX63SrecT3mw" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $40 at Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The US Copyright Office just struck a blow for the right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broken cracked iphone stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wrlVUxbfadBkKWD8up9DYus7LrY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051675/cracked-iphone-stock-1198.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CuI6wW"&gt;The US Copyright Office is expanding a legal shield for fixing digital devices, including cars and medical devices. This morning, the office submitted &lt;a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/copyright/1201/2021/2021_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf"&gt;new exemptions to Section 1201 of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act&lt;/a&gt;, which bars breaking software copy protection. The resulting rules include a revamped section on device repair, reflecting renewed government pressure around “right to repair” issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojr0O0"&gt;The Register of Copyrights recommends &lt;a href="https://www.copyright.gov/1201/2021/"&gt;Section 1201 “anti-circumvention” exemptions&lt;/a&gt; every three years, a process that has offered legal protections for everything from unlocking cellphones to ripping DVD clips for classroom use. In addition to renewing these and several other exemptions, this latest rulemaking adopts repair-related proposals from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, iFixit, and other organizations. The Librarian of Congress  adopted the recommendations in a &lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf"&gt;final rule&lt;/a&gt; that will take effect tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hmalw9"&gt;The exemptions replace an itemized list of repairable devices with broad protections for any consumer devices that rely on software to function, as well as land and sea vehicles and medical devices that aren’t consumer-focused. The rulemaking doesn’t rewrite the exemption to cover all &lt;em&gt;non-&lt;/em&gt;consumer devices, and it doesn’t cover all “modification,” only “diagnosis, maintenance, and repair.” For video game consoles specifically, repair only covers repairing the device’s optical drives and requires reenabling any technological protection measures that were circumvented afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jlb0xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Repair organizations have been pushing exemptions for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezkjWc"&gt;“The petitioners did a good job of showing commonalities across different types of devices,” said Acting General Counsel Kevin Amer on a phone call with reporters. “We also are aware of some of the efforts that the executive branch has undertaken in this area,” including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;executive order from the Biden administration&lt;/a&gt; supporting third-party and consumer repair work. “We do think that this exemption will be useful and will help to facilitate that type of activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ma0jov"&gt;Other agencies — as well as state and federal lawmakers — have their own right to repair policies on the table. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;pledged to fight business practices&lt;/a&gt; that lock out independent repair shops. This copyright rulemaking doesn’t address those practices, but it helps lift a legal threat hanging over technicians and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ibbHG"&gt;Right to repair expansion sits alongside several other changes. The Copyright Office nixed some requests to expand an exemption for reproducing clips of movies and TV shows, for instance, but it supplemented the categories of people who can do this for educational use, covering education staff beyond faculty members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LxeMo"&gt;The rule extends exemptions for converting video to accessible formats for people with disabilities, letting educators add subtitles or audio captions before someone requests an accessible version as long as they reasonably expect it will be needed. Video game players with disabilities can also circumvent systems that prevent them from using nonstandard input devices on computers, although the exemptions don’t add some broader requested accessibility protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W6BD6Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Copyright Office also updated exemptions for accessibility and medical data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbxVpQ"&gt;Meanwhile, archival libraries should be able to create copies of deteriorating disc-based media if they can’t find a replacement copy elsewhere. (The office rejected requests that people be able to break copy protection to shift media into different formats, however.) The report expands the language of an exemption for security researchers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPUvvL"&gt;The new policy loosens &lt;a href="https://clinic.cyber.harvard.edu/2015/10/27/dmca-exception-granted-for-medical-device-research-patient-access-to-data/"&gt;a 2015 exemption&lt;/a&gt; granting access to medical device data, rewording it to cover devices that aren’t implanted and letting patients authorize third parties to access it, although some methods of access could still violate liability laws. It also grants jailbreaking exceptions for video streaming devices like the Apple TV and for routers and other networking hardware, as long as it’s not done to access pirated media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mH42Hx"&gt;Section 1201 remains a controversial (and, some &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/21/digital-millennium-copyright-act-eff-supreme-court"&gt;critics contend,&lt;/a&gt; unconstitutional) piece of the DMCA. It’s intended to prevent breaking digital rights management software that protects copyrighted media, but as software becomes an increasingly important part of basic consumer devices, it’s cast a legal pall over myriad non-piracy-related activity. The renewal cycle also means that educators, security researchers, repair technicians, and others will go through this process again in a few years — but for now, they’ve seen some welcome changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new TVs will soon support Apple AirPlay 2 and HomeKit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn16Ht5TdjOu74_4qjvsD-Ztnw=/183x0:2430x1498/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051650/Screen_Shot_2021_09_09_at_7.38.51_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2RuB2k"&gt;Amazon is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662673/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-price-features"&gt;making its own TVs&lt;/a&gt;, and today marks the release of the company’s Omni and 4-Series Fire TVs. As the 4K HDR sets start making their way to customers, Amazon is making one more last-minute announcement: it plans to add support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit features “soon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAFoJJ"&gt;AirPlay 2 makes it easy to play content on the TV screen from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. And HomeKit integration will allow the Omni and 4-Series TVs to be controlled by Siri or the Home app; it also makes it easy to include them in smart home routines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGUV78"&gt;Amazon has already rolled out AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/apple-airplay-2-and-homekit-now-available-on-toshiba-and-insignia-4k-uhd-smart-fire-tv-2020-models-89188a0b0fb3"&gt;some of its “Fire TV Edition” TVs from Toshiba and Insignia&lt;/a&gt;. Curiously, these features have yet to come to the company’s standalone Fire TV streaming devices — including the just-released Fire TV Stick 4K Max. I’m not sure if that’s an intentional choice, but it’s a bit odd that Amazon is ready to announce support on day one for its brand-new TVs with nothing to share about AirPlay 2 coming to its cheaper devices. (Roku supports AirPlay 2 on both its players and Roku TVs.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXQrx"&gt;The Fire TV Omni series TVs offer the better picture quality of the two lines and come with built-in far-field microphones for hands-free Alexa voice commands. The 65-inch and 75-inch models support Dolby Vision HDR, though there are also smaller 43-, 50-, and 55-inch sizes available with HDR10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0D51s"&gt;Stay tuned for our impressions of Amazon’s first self-branded 4K TVs in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15I9Eu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal</title>

  &lt;p&gt;The new regular AirPods get a lot right even before the gimmicky spatial audio part&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYTlYX"&gt;For the first time since their introduction in 2016, Apple’s AirPods have a completely new design. The third-generation AirPods, priced at $179, bear a much closer resemblance to the AirPods Pro than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;long-stemmed original&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-gen pairs&lt;/a&gt;. Apple has upgraded their sound, added new features like spatial audio head tracking, made them more durable with IPX4 water resistance, and lengthened their battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFDLaT"&gt;What remains unchanged about the AirPods is their ease of use and deep integration with Apple’s ecosystem of devices including the iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. If you’re living in Apple’s world, you still get exclusive features like the intuitive, just-hold-them-near-your-iPhone setup, audio sharing, automatic device switching, and other software tricks that have helped the AirPods stay atop the true wireless earbuds market by a wide margin. The third-generation AirPods also gain more extensive Find My support to help you locate them if they go missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iup0oN"&gt;The AirPods Pro and AirPods Max didn’t even exist the last time Apple refreshed its standard AirPods. So the third-gen earbuds also establish more feature parity across the entire lineup. There are definitely still reasons to pick those products instead — active noise cancellation, namely — but anyone who’s ready to upgrade their original AirPods will find a lot to like with the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LWOCkg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10826364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="444ptP"&gt;These AirPods basically look like the AirPods Pro with their ear tips chopped off. They share similar contours, especially now that Apple has shortened the stems by 33 percent. There are also grilled black speakers, mics, and vents around each earbud. These hardware elements have become so prominent that I’m surprised Apple isn’t offering the new AirPods in black to help camouflage them. But nope: they still only come in white. Since their design is now so similar, Apple carried over the “force sensor” controls from the AirPods Pro, with an indent on each stem that designates where to press. The tap gestures from the old AirPods are gone. Apple’s non-remappable controls handle media playback, and you can summon Siri with a long press. But you’ve also got hands-free “Hey Siri” voice commands at your disposal for adjusting volume or changing up the playlist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfbDUX"&gt;Unlike the Pros, there are no silicone ear tips for a customizable fit: as with its previous standard AirPods, Apple sticks with a one-size-fits-most hard plastic design. They’re open-style earbuds that rest in your ears instead of extending deep into the ear canal. A lot of people love the barely there comfort of the AirPods. The main side effect of their open design is that they let in a ton of outside noise. For me, that’s always been a significant turnoff. But again, others value having the added awareness — be it for personal safety reasons or otherwise — and view this as an upside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GOF4UNksPfsgjJRt-H2qZmI9HNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953794/IMG_0048_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods (below) are clearly cut from the same cloth as the AirPods Pro (above).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="die3Jr"&gt;Unfortunately, fit is where the old AirPods have always let me down. They just weren’t a good match for my large-ish ears and would come loose and fall out way too easily. All ears are different, and I know a ton of people who had no such issues. But I was expecting another round of disappointment when I put the third-gen AirPods into my ears for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nBcM1"&gt;Fortunately, the new shape fits my ears much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFVPQU"&gt;Apple says it conducted a ton of user research when designing the third-generation AirPods, involving thousands of ear scans, heat maps, and so on. And at least in my case, something about the new shape definitely works better. They’re staying put so well that I no longer feel the same anxiety about them tumbling onto the ground and down a sewer grate. That worry was always present with the older AirPods. The healthy dose of ambient sound remains, and I’m just someone who prefers earbuds that offer some quiet from the outside world. But I can finally say that Apple’s regular AirPods fit me, and that was never true previously. If you had issues with the original design, it’s worth giving these a try.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woYRg7Y4GOzAoeIkIMHF92IN-90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953799/IMG_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new AirPods have much shorter stems than before.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YBojuP"&gt;The charging case now opens in landscape — just like the case for the AirPods Pro — but it’s noticeably smaller than that one. It’s closer in overall size to the original AirPods case, though a smidge thicker. The case still has a Lightning port for wired charging, and it also supports Qi-compatible wireless chargers. Apple says the new AirPods case is designed to work with the company’s MagSafe chargers. And sure enough, it grabs onto the circular MagSafe charging pad with the same perfect alignment as an iPhone 12 or 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nISprs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the old AirPods never fit your ears, these might do the trick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8V0LTd"&gt;But don’t expect to charge your earbuds by placing them on the back of Apple’s MagSafe-ready iPhones: there’s no reverse wireless charging. And to drive that point home, Apple told me it intentionally designed the AirPods case so that it doesn’t magnetically latch onto the back of those phones. You’ll feel some pull when sliding the case around the back of the phone, but it’s nowhere near enough force to keep the two attached. As for the actual battery life, Apple says the third-gen AirPods can hit six hours of continuous playback and a total of 30 hours counting case recharges. That’s a modest improvement over the five hours and “over 24 hours” estimates from the previous model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wiGbOD"&gt;Both the AirPods and their case are now rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance. Plenty of people used the older generations for workouts, but the official certification gives added peace of mind if you’ll frequently be using these AirPods as a gym companion. There’s also a new “skin detection sensor” on each earbud that replaces the old IR sensor. It still tells the AirPods to pause when removed from your ears (or resume when placed back in), but Apple says this sensor can tell the difference between your ears or tight spaces like a pants pocket that might’ve fooled the previous AirPods into resuming playback if you put them in there without the case. It’s not difficult to envision future evolutions of this sensor tying into Apple’s health and fitness efforts. But for now it’s just there to make auto-pause more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFY7Ex"&gt;Apple has completely redesigned the acoustic driver and amplifier in the third-gen AirPods. The company told me it aimed to give them a sound profile similar to the AirPods Pro. There’s only so much you can do with open-style earbuds to improve bass performance; these will never pack the same low-end punch as many upscale in-ear buds. But the new AirPods do sound noticeably fuller and more dynamic than their predecessors — and yes, very similar to the Pros. In the right ways, they still sound like AirPods, and they’re tuned to work equally well for music, watching videos, podcasts, games, and so on. But Apple says music is still far and away the leading thing people use their AirPods for, so it’s trying to deliver the best audio quality possible in this form factor. I’ve found that the open design often leads to a more spacious soundstage. The AirPods are still handily outperformed by top-tier earbuds like Sony’s WF-1000XM4 or the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but among other buds with an open design, they’re up there with the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WK-mSuFuVOg5iUNkHQdRI1SwPYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953803/IMG_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The third-gen AirPods have redesigned drivers and support spatial audio with head tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lfClhR"&gt;To further enhance their sound, the new AirPods use the same adaptive EQ feature as the Pros and Max. There’s an inward-facing mic on each earbud that analyzes what you’re hearing and, so Apple claims, adjusts the output in real time to what’s best for your unique ear shape. But the thing about adaptive EQ is that it’s impossible to ever really know when it’s doing something — or what that something is. It’s invisible to the listener at all times, so there’s not much to say about it. There’s no telling whether the improved sound is due to the redesigned drivers, the inclusion of adaptive EQ, or a combination of both. The third-gen AirPods do a better job of steering audio into your ears, which also helps achieve that full-bodied sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPpQJ6"&gt;But that brings us to the big trick Apple is advertising with the new AirPods: spatial audio with head tracking. Like the AirPods Pro and Max, the third-gen pair can dynamically adjust the sound in each earbud as you turn your head from side to side, keeping the sound source anchored to the iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV you’re watching. When you’re watching movies in Netflix, HBO Max, Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, or other popular apps, this head tracking can be an immersive, fun experience and mimics surround sound better than a regular stereo mix would. It really does add to the satisfaction of watching movies on my iPad Pro. And for those times when someone’s asleep at home and you can’t take advantage of your soundbar or surround system on the Apple TV, you can listen in private with AirPods and spatial audio head tracking. Apple has also thought of other use cases: on group FaceTime calls, spatial audio creates a sound field that places the voices where they’re positioned on your device’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HUXc0F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We’re still in the early days of spatial audio — and you can tell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="683JZk"&gt;But when it comes to music, it all feels far more gimmicky. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;I’ve written about Apple Music’s Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; before, and everything there applies here. The feature works with all headphones, but only the third-gen AirPods, Pros, and Max add head tracking to the equation. That doesn’t really change where I stand on it. Spatial audio mixes can often sound objectively worse than their stereo counterparts. It takes a lot of work from engineers and producers to get the most from Atmos, and it remains obvious that a lot of albums available in spatial audio on Apple Music haven’t gotten that level of attention. Instruments and effects can sound out of place, vocals can get drowned out in the mix, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1oiF2"&gt;The situation is improving as newer records are mixed for Atmos from the get-go. (And Atmos mixes do generally sound a lot better on actual Atmos home theater systems.) The recent Giles Martin remix of &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt; by The Beatles takes advantage of spatial audio well without trying to do too much. It has that feeling of being in the room with the band. But other examples, like Kacey Musgraves’ &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, don’t do anything for me that I don’t already get from the stereo version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BrGfV"&gt;In short, spatial audio can wow when it comes to video, but we’re still in the very early stages of the music side — and it’s not a reason to buy these earbuds yet. Apple makes it easy to switch back and forth between spatial audio and regular sound in Control Center. And iOS 15 actually lets you “spatialize” sound from apps like Spotify that don’t otherwise offer the feature. I guess that’s nice to have if you really find yourself loving this new way of listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W73EEHXIiB114uTu-QbiD6XBZUY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22953861/IMG_0049_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like all AirPods before them, the third-gen earbuds are positioned as the perfect iPhone accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGJmS"&gt;The AirPods have long been the champion of voice calls, and with the third-gen set, Apple is trying to improve the fidelity of FaceTime calls by using a new AAC-ELD codec for clearer voice reproduction. There’s also acoustic mesh on the outward-facing side of each AirPod that’s meant to reduce wind noise. Despite the shorter stems, overall microphone performance remains excellent and the new AirPods remain easy to recommend if you want earbuds that guarantee you’ll come through clearly on calls. Stay tuned for our video review for the full mic test — with Becca, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1Vctld"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10826383"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1Oafy"&gt;Apple has also given the new AirPods a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711557/apple-lost-airpods-pro-max-find-my-network-now-available"&gt;deeper level of integration with its Find My app&lt;/a&gt;. You could always play a sound to find a missing (nearby) earbud or see the location where they were last connected to your phone. But now the third-gen AirPods get the same “find nearby” feature as the AirPods Pro and Max. This is an AirTags-like interface for pinpointing where the AirPods are if you’re in close proximity to them. It’s not as accurate as an AirTag, but the UI will tell you when the AirPods are “nearby” and then show “here” when you’re right near them. If they’re really nowhere to be found, you can also now enable lost mode and be alerted if your missing AirPods come within range of millions of other iOS devices. My favorite of the new Find My features are the separation alerts that automatically pop up if you leave your AirPods behind somewhere. That alone should prevent a lot of heartbreak and lost earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4aimgs"&gt;The new AirPods are the first big redesign of Apple’s massively popular true wireless earbuds. From a fit and comfort standpoint, I think Apple succeeded: these are still wonderfully lightweight earbuds, and they actually stay in my ears now. The sound quality has seen some refinement, and the third-gen AirPods are a better gym buddy than their predecessors. Plus you’ve got longer battery life and nice-to-have features like spatial audio head tracking — even if Apple is overselling it a bit. I’ll personally be sticking with the AirPods Pro and other earbuds that offer noise cancellation or at least some isolation. But if you prefer the open-style AirPods and have an older pair that can’t hold a charge anymore, these are a worthwhile upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Y3dZlM"&gt;But before you go getting locked deeper into Apple’s ecosystem, it’s worth exploring your options. The game has changed a lot since the second-gen AirPods were released, and it’s possible to find better sound quality among competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and others. If you can do without the frills, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22676362/jabra-elite-3-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;spend much less and still be happy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, if you’ve got an iPhone, none of those can deliver the same seamless experience as the AirPods. They’re still designed to perfectly complement Apple’s smartphone, and in that regard they don’t disappoint. Perhaps more than any other Apple product today, AirPods still just work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hinge adds voice notes and voice prompts to dating profiles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgAGOlGuswUoUVP9iqnZO04hUMw=/12x0:2036x1349/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051480/Hinge_Voice_Prompts.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6WJUWB"&gt;Dating app Hinge is adding new audio features, letting users answer the “getting to know you” prompts on their profile using audio clips and exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82pFAg"&gt;The new features will roll out Wednesday globally and are the latest example of apps using voice to add a new dimension to digital dating. Rival services like Bumble and Happn have already added voice notes to their app, and one app, String, &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; lets users &lt;a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/life/sex-and-relationships/string-new-dating-app-710735"&gt;communicate with their voice&lt;/a&gt;. For many people, the sound of someone’s voice can be an important part of attraction, and exchanging voice notes is a more expressive way to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I3TJ0K6MqT2LB_hb9992ruqyF8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22956117/Hinge_Voice_Notes.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hinge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users will be able to exchange voice notes in chat. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cjNyRK"&gt;If users want to add a voice prompt to their profile, they should make sure the app is updated, then head to Settings &amp;gt; Edit Profile &amp;gt; Voice Prompt. You can record a voice note for any of Hinge’s regular prompts (questions like worst date stories and favorite random facts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhvpRr"&gt;“Hinge wants to help people get to know you as soon as they see your profile. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, imagine how many your voice is,” said Hinge’s chief product officer Michelle Parsons in a press release. “With the introduction of Voice Prompts, we’re adding more authenticity to the profile experience, allowing users to fully display their personality in a new way.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple seems to have forgotten it built a notch in the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fzIU2sWM9jTd-nqoUNbHC4KQRXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70051450/akrales_211020_4803_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wUpwvb"&gt;Apple’s new MacBook Pro notch is misbehaving. Early adopters have discovered inconsistencies in how Apple handles the notch across macOS and in individual apps, resulting in unexpected behavior where status bar items can get hidden under the notch. These inconsistencies make it feel like Apple has forgotten, in areas of macOS, that it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"&gt;built a notch into the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWuMbY"&gt;Snazzy Labs owner Quinn Nelson has posted two videos on Twitter demonstrating some of the early notch issues. The main video demonstrates what appears to be a bug in macOS. Status bar items like Apple’s battery indicator can get hidden underneath the notch when status bar items are extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NQyk9a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;WHO DESIGNED THIS?!   &lt;a href="https://t.co/ADVqmfdqV2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ADVqmfdqV2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyQ) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SnazzyQ/status/1453143798251339778?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fuoITI"&gt;Nelson demonstrates this with iStat Menus, which can be hidden under the notch or can force system items like the battery indicator to be hidden underneath the notch. While Apple has issued guidance to developers on how to work with the notch, the developer behind iStat Menus says the app is just &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bjango/status/1453171506263982087"&gt;using standard status items&lt;/a&gt; and that Apple’s dev guidance “won’t solve the issue presented in the video.” This doesn’t appear to be intended behavior, as the notch works differently inside certain apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTy9Dr"&gt;Nelson also highlights how an older version of DaVinci Resolve avoids the notch. In apps that haven’t been updated for the notch, you can’t even move your mouse pointer into it. Apple blocks off this space so that older apps can’t display menu items underneath the notch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-problem-status-items/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; that this behavior is inconsistent across the rest of macOS, though, so if you have Finder in focus then the cursor can get lost behind the notch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYjzzm"&gt;The notch can also exacerbate existing macOS issues. Apps like DaVinci Resolve (with extended menu items) can take over the space used by system status items. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/macbook-pro-notch-menu-bar-behavior/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt; this is regular macOS behavior, but that the notch obviously reduces the amount of space for both the menu items and status items. It’s an ongoing issue that has spawned apps like &lt;a href="https://www.macbartender.com/"&gt;Bartender&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer"&gt;Dozer&lt;/a&gt; to help manage the macOS menu bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fIN0Ud"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new MacBook Pro has a notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732912/apple-macbook-pro-notch-display"},{"title":"Apple botched the MacBook Pro notch ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734676/apple-macbook-pro-notch-botch-face-id-missing-feature-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LuBPiE"&gt;It’s not clear how Apple will address these inconsistencies, even as developers update their regular apps to work around the notch. Thankfully, these problems will be extremely rare and will only likely appear in apps with lots of menu or status items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6ji0r"&gt;Either way, it’s odd this wasn’t a design consideration ahead of the MacBook Pro launch. As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1453145302836256771"&gt;Dieter Bohn puts it&lt;/a&gt;: “Soooo the team in charge of Menu Items in apps was read in on the notch, but the team in charge of Menu Status items was not? lol”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WZSfw"&gt;In other words, don’t blame app developers, it’s notch always gonna be their fault.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;PIXAR&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stoxfp"&gt;Have you ever really wondered about Buzz Lightyear’s origin story? Not the action figure, which helped make &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt; so beloved, but the actual space ranger? Well, Disney and Pixar sure are hoping so with the upcoming feature &lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as “the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear” and the first trailer makes it look like a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;-style sci-fi adventure, complete with cool spaceships and futuristic alien worlds. The movie even casts an action movie star, with Chris Evans handling Buzz’s voice. Angus MacLane, who co-directed &lt;em&gt;Finding Dory&lt;/em&gt;, is serving as director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxfJT2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lightyear&lt;/em&gt; was actually first announced last year, but you’d be forgiven for forgetting about it: the reveal was part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;a massive wave of more than 50 updates from Disney&lt;/a&gt;. It certainly marks a shift in tone for both Pixar and &lt;em&gt;Toy Story&lt;/em&gt;. Disney says the movie will be coming out on June 17th, 2022, though it’s not clear if it will be exclusive to theaters or available on Disney Plus as well.&lt;/p&gt;
