    <title>Unannounced Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti GPU appears on Asus’ website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yMr1aA"&gt;Nvidia might be preparing to launch a new RTX 3050 Ti GPU, according to a leak from laptop maker Asus. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-confirms-geforce-rtx-3050-ti-laptop-gpu-with-4gb-gddr6-memory"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Asus has published updated specifications for its latest TUF Dash F15 gaming laptop, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FLaptops%2FFor-Gaming%2FTUF-Gaming%2F2021-ASUS-TUF-Dash-F15%2Ftechspec%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22315175%2Fnvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu-asus-leak-rumor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it mentions&lt;/a&gt; an unreleased Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 Ti Laptop GPU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeOPh"&gt;The numbering scheme suggests Nvidia could be about to launch a fourth 30-Series laptop GPU to join the existing RTX 3060, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards. Asus’ website mentions the card has 4GB of memory, but the company hasn’t included any further details on clock speeds etc. The RTX 3050 Ti is rumored to be an entry-level option, with a 128-bit memory bus and 60W TGP. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kC2Gk9zH8nw1GrD3979kb0uaaHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347708/av1egMf.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YjDh3c"&gt;Nvidia’s launch of RTX 30-Series laptop GPUs has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22243065/nvidia-gaming-laptop-graphic-chips-capability-manufacturer-transparency"&gt;been a little confusing&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia is no longer adding “Max-Q” labels to the weaker, more power-efficient variants of its laptop-grade GPUs, and it’s more difficult to tell exactly what GPU you’re getting. Nvidia has started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;requiring laptop makers&lt;/a&gt; to be more transparent about RTX 30-series specs, but the previous Max-Q branding made it a lot easier to work out a laptop’s GPU performance without having to know its specific clock speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78GpOm"&gt;We’ve reached out to both Nvidia and Asus to comment on the RTX 3050 Ti appearance, and we’ll update you accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is making it easier for creators to answer their fans’ questions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aye7VujKvQdYyO3I50r3TeFqKMg=/0x0:1938x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916070/b02170a10e78426f1f250ee62f745091.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Presenters can spotlight questions during a live stream.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="veWK2Q"&gt;TikTok has &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-q-and-a"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; a new Q&amp;amp;A feature that’s designed to help creators answer questions from their fans. It’s available on both pre-recorded and live videos, and works by having viewers mark their comment as a question. Creators can then either answer questions via a text comment or video reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEbVFp"&gt;In live videos, presenters can select questions from a dedicated menu, and then choose to highlight them during live responses. In video replies, Q&amp;amp;A comments can be added as stickers, which link back to the video where the question was originally asked. A new section in a creator’s profile aggregates all their Q&amp;amp;As into one place as well as serving as another place for viewers to ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AghwoX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935520747200711942" data-video-id="6935520747200711942" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new Q&amp;amp;A feature is now here to help you ask or answer any questions. Try it out now!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - TikTok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6935520869284334341"&gt;♬ original sound - TikTok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHJeXq"&gt;TikTok says the feature is available for Creator Accounts, which anyone can switch to via the “Manage account” option in settings. “To turn on Q&amp;amp;A, go to your settings and privacy page, select Creator, tap Q&amp;amp;A and hit the “Turn on Q&amp;amp;A” button to activate the feature,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKXcQg"&gt;The Q&amp;amp;A feature was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/20/tiktoks-new-qa-feature-lets-creators-respond-to-fan-questions-using-text-or-video/"&gt;being tested&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year as an opt-in feature to Creator Accounts with over 10,000 followers. Now, it’s available worldwide to anyone who wants to opt-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6xEvk0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok/video/6935521116114914566" data-video-id="6935521116114914566" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@tiktok" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tiktok"&gt;@tiktok&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can now ask and answer any questions on LIVE with the new Q&amp;amp;A feature.

    <title>Getaround wants to help you start your own car-sharing business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Car-Sharing Companies Offer A Less Germ-Infested Route Forward" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ozx8U5p2qdlbmuOVZz12LQPKW1I=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68916016/1219575018.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Afc22"&gt;Getaround, the peer-to-peer car-sharing service, is launching a new program to help support people who want to rent out more than just a couple of cars. The program is called Power Host, and it’s designed to help customers manage small fleets of shared vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N08qOf"&gt;Getaround, which operates in 800 cities globally and has over 6 million users, created the program in response to a growing number of its customers seeking to start a small car-sharing business for themselves. After an initial steep drop in bookings after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Getaround has since seen its demand bounce back. And now people are looking for ways to use the platform in a more professional capacity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IK8hy"&gt;“We just started seeing a significant increase in owners who had a few cars [and] who wanted to buy more,” Dan Kim, chief operating officer at Getaround, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They were seeing a lot more demand and they wanted to just have more vehicles and more service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hw05p3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We just started seeing a significant increase in owners who had a few cars [and] who wanted to buy more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UidQwW"&gt;He added, “Our hosts were asking for help on how to grow the business. We responded with a program that really helps anybody who wants to use Getaround as an opportunity to grow their business and to do so effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24b6cV"&gt;As a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.getaround.com%2Fpromotions%2Fcar-sharing-for-entrepreneurs&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314188%2Fgetaround-car-sharing-power-host-enterprise-business" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Power Host&lt;/a&gt;, customers will get access to a personal account manager from Getaround who can help them manage their fleets. Getaround will also supply Power Host users with data that will help them figure out the best place to put their cars. For example, if Getaround sees that demand for a car rental is high in a certain neighborhood, the company will let its Power Host users know the best places to park their vehicles, especially those spots that are reserved for Getaround customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JiQ0x"&gt;Getaround provides a $1 million insurance that covers the vehicle’s owner while it’s in use, and access to a 24/7 hotline for both the vehicle owner and the customer who is renting it. The company says its insurance policy includes “comprehensive, collision, and liability coverage,” though the vehicle is only covered while it is in use. The company also provides guidance to vehicle owners on best practices for cleaning, maintenance, and sanitizing their fleet to ensure customers are protected from any possible contagions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRN4cp"&gt;Kim, who formerly worked as the head of Airbnb plus and head of global sales and delivery at Tesla, joined the company in October on the heels of a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/14/getaround-raises-a-140-million-series-e-amid-rebound-in-short-distance-travel/"&gt;$140 million investment deal&lt;/a&gt; that brought Getaround’s total known venture funding to $600 million. He said that the business is recovering from the dramatic decrease in demand that it experienced at the start of the pandemic and was looking for new revenue sources as it continues to work its way through its recovery. Kim noted that car-sharing is asset-light compared to legacy car rental companies, in so far as it doesn’t own its fleet of vehicles, and is less dependent on business travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D50Pw5"&gt;Several reports surfaced last year that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/thieves-are-using-peer-to-peer-car-rental-apps-to-find-their-next-ride/2020/02/13/b84d8e16-49c0-11ea-9164-d3154ad8a5cd_story.html"&gt;car thieves were using car-sharing apps&lt;/a&gt; like Getaround to find and break into cars that had the keys left inside. Kim said that while those incidents were uncommon, Getaround works with law enforcement to help recover the vehicles for their users. The company also is working on new technology, such as safer lox boxes for keys, to deter theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cOOtM"&gt;It’s also working on improving its carbon footprint. Kim says research shows that car-sharing helps reduce car ownership, which helps decrease the amount of carbon that is emitted into the atmosphere. He noted that, unlike most car owners, which tend to purchase large gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, the most popular cars on Getaround are smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles, like Tesla or Toyota Prius. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTvu4p"&gt;“Perhaps you might drive the same number of miles, but maybe you’re driving more efficient cars, you’re driving cars that are more appropriate for your use case,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s latest USB-C hub supports 4K at 60Hz, and 100W pass-through</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WwWPVkneTRTcQBEKrDn8zECeiyo=/0x0:1158x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915882/ezgif.com_gif_maker__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HDMI, VGA, USB-A, and USB-C ports are all included.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gq2LhR"&gt;Satechi has released a new USB-C hub for your laptop to add all the ports that it arguably should have included in the first place. Although the port selection on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsatechi.net%2Fproducts%2Fusb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter%3Fvariant%3D33736080523352&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314998%2Fsatechi-usb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter-4k-60hz-100w-sd-card-gigabith-ethernet-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.99 USB-C On-the-Go Multiport Adapter&lt;/a&gt; is similar to other hubs, the high spec of each port makes Satechi’s device worthy of attention. As well as laptops, it also works with USB-C tablets like recent iPad Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5UNvKU"&gt;The hub’s got HDMI, which offers a maximum resolution of 4K and refresh rate of 60Hz, and there’s USB-C PD pass-through charging at &lt;a href="https://support.satechi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057100052-Will-the-USB-C-PD-pass-through-port-charge-my-16-inch-MacBook-Pro-"&gt;up to 100W&lt;/a&gt; (though you have to provide your own power brick). The cable for attaching it to your device isn’t fixed like it is on some hubs, and Satechi supplies two USB-C to USB-C cables with the hub. One’s 1-m long, and there’s a second short cable that can be tucked into the hub when you’re traveling. Rounding out the selection there’s a VGA port that supports up to 1080p/60Hz, two USB-A and one USB-C data-only ports, gigabit Ethernet, and SD and microSD card slots.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ao9dL6nAJNfMe0KTzTDZQHTpsfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347526/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It works with laptops and USB-C tablets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7IhBRA"&gt;We’ve seen plenty of USB-C hubs offer similar specs in the past, but it’s less common to see them all offered together in such a convenient package. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/7/12/20692048/sony-usb-c-hub-mrw-s3-pd-charging-100w-uhs-ii-sd-card-fast-speeds"&gt;MRW-S3 announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; offered 100W USB-C PD but maxed out at 4K/30Hz. This &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fvariant%2Fpowerexpand-8in1-usbc-pd-10gbps-data-hub%2FA83830A1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F5%2F22314998%2Fsatechi-usb-c-on-the-go-multiport-adapter-4k-60hz-100w-sd-card-gigabith-ethernet-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;USB-C hub from Anker&lt;/a&gt; does 4K/60Hz and “charging at up to 100W (minus 15W for operation)” but it’s got a short USB-C host cable that isn’t detachable. Satechi’s new hub also only takes up one USB-C port on your device, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20826671/satechi-usb-c-hub-4k-60hz-hdmi-multimedia-adapter-macos"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; we’ve &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/11/hyper-duo-usb-c-hub-100-w-charging-macbook-pro/"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gegbTy"&gt;It also offers the flexibility of an additional VGA port alongside its HDMI port, though a Satechi &lt;a href="https://support.satechi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057569491-Can-you-connect-2-external-monitors-using-the-HDMI-and-VGA-port-on-the-hub-"&gt;support page notes&lt;/a&gt; that “the VGA port only supports mirroring.” That’s likely to make the VGA port most useful for connecting your laptop or tablet to a projector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1aqbuU"&gt;Satechi’s new hub is available now for $99.99, and until March 15th the company is offering 20 percent off if you use the code “MULTIPORT20”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is speeding up Chrome’s release cycle to every four weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQOWN0ow4gYcu5h-RhMDSlj_MZI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915795/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JGdlxy"&gt;Google says it will speed up how it releases Chrome updates. Starting with Chrome 94 in Q3, 2021, Google will release milestones of its browser every four weeks, instead of every six weeks. This is the first time Google has sped up its Chrome release schedule for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4RnDm"&gt;“As we have improved our testing and release processes for Chrome, and deployed bi-weekly security updates to improve our patch gap, it became clear that we could shorten our release cycle and deliver new features more quickly,” &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2021/03/speeding-up-release-cycle.html"&gt;explains Alex Mineer&lt;/a&gt;, a technical program manager at Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oFMO1r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;IT admins can stick to an eight-week version of Chrome&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q0Lw11"&gt;While consumers will see a new version of Chrome every month, IT administrators will be able to opt for a new Extended Stable option that includes milestone releases every eight weeks. Extended Stable will be available for enterprise administrators and Chromium embedders that need the extra time to manage updates in their environments. Important security updates will still arrive every two weeks in this version, but Extended Stable should hopefully avoid the situation where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966237/google-chrome-white-tab-screen-crash-experiment-it-admins"&gt;silent Chrome experiments end up angering IT admins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgYEbB"&gt;Google says it’s also planning “multiple stable release options” for Chrome OS, and will share details with Chrome OS admins in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9MMyW"&gt;It’s not yet clear how Chromium contributors like Brave and Microsoft will handle their own releases of Chromium browsers in response to Google’s changes.

    <title>Here’s what Twitter’s rumored ‘undo send’ feature could look like</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gmvwn_DE4ndRspG7qi3Ute9dKwA=/0x0:750x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915757/IuynE_2d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alongside the typical “Your Tweet was sent” dialogue, there’s a new Undo button.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841" target="_blank"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kF2mZ8"&gt;A potential animation for Twitter’s long-rumored “undo send” feature has been discovered by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841"&gt;app researcher Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, giving us our best look yet at how it might work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="np6vWD"&gt;The interface shows Twitter’s familiar “Your Tweet was sent” dialog above a new “Undo” button. The undo button doubles as a progress bar, which appears to show you how long you have to undo a tweet before it gets sent. Gmail offers a similar option for emails, where it provides a short window to stop messages from being sent after clicking the “Send” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y2vQz0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on “Undo Send” timer for tweets &lt;a href="https://t.co/nS0kuijPK0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nS0kuijPK0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1367704041942179841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg0Rvu"&gt;“Undo send” has been a rumored part of a paid Twitter subscription tier after it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;first mentioned in a user survey last year&lt;/a&gt;. It might not be the “edit button” that Twitter users have been requesting forever (and which will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066815/twitter-edit-button-jack-dorsey-says-no"&gt;probably never happen&lt;/a&gt;), but it would still offer users the ability to quickly stop a tweet from posting if they spot a last second typo or Bad Take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1G8EuF"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272364/twitter-premium-subscriptions-tweetdeck-undo-send-tipping-ads"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter is exploring paid subscriptions as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising revenue in response to competition from Facebook and Snapchat. The subscriptions could include access to features like “undo send” and profile customization options, it said. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported that Twitter was exploring ways for users to pay one another for exclusive content, a feature the company later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced as Super Follows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Dn9mw"&gt;Jane Manchun Wong is an app researcher who digs through code to find unreleased and unannounced features. Last year she was among the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/4/21500687/twitter-birdwatch-misinfo-tool-propaganda"&gt;first to spot Twitter’s Birdwatch initiative&lt;/a&gt; to allow users to root out misinformation on its service, and she also spotted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21626494/twitter-verification-returns-early-2021-policy-feedback"&gt;Twitter’s overhaul of its verification system&lt;/a&gt; prior to its official announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-branded RedMagic gaming phone launched with 165Hz screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J-SCNrcWjZGJVFlJcmOJZY1R2ts=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68915577/3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jt4Wf9"&gt;RedMagic, the gaming brand of ZTE subdivision Nubia, has launched a new smartphone in collaboration with Chinese tech and gaming giant Tencent. The RedMagic 6 and 6 Pro are high-end devices available to order now in China, with a global launch coming later this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQdVcr"&gt;The RedMagic 6 has an Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, active fan cooling, and a 6.8-inch 1080p OLED display with a refresh rate of 165Hz, making it the fastest phone screen on the market today. RedMagic is also claiming a single-finger touch sampling rate of up to 500Hz, or up to 360Hz with multitouch. The touch-sensitive capacitive “shoulder triggers” on the side, meanwhile, are sampled at up to 400Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6jJmx"&gt;The RedMagic 6 Pro is mostly identical, but it comes with up to 18GB of RAM and has a faster 120W charging system that RedMagic says can fully charge the 4,500mAh battery in just 17 minutes. The non-Pro 6 has a bigger 5,050mAh battery but a slower 66W system that takes 38 minutes for a full charge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HN1LvaJwULNtfRUY6d00qgw3GI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22347425/4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QKP5kY"&gt;The Tencent collaboration is quite unusual. RedMagic says that the phone’s software is optimized for Tencent apps like WeChat and QQ, with 50 percent faster read and write speeds. Tencent’s Solar Core gaming software is also preloaded, and the company promises it improves game response speed, frame rates, and network latency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="no35i3"&gt;The RedMagic 6 starts at 3,799 yuan (~$585) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, but you can pay almost twice as much for a fully loaded 18GB/512GB RedMagic 6 Pro — that’ll cost 6,599 yuan (~$1,020). Global pricing will likely be different, however; RedMagic will announce international release plans on March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new Anzu smart glasses break from the pack with truly wireless audio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYzhZA4mvfQHcogxYYUlhmXJ8jg=/0x0:980x653/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914876/0633B061_F5EE_4959_96DD_F2703EE12435.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9xq6V"&gt;Razer is tonight formally announcing its Anzu “smart” glasses, which follow Bose, Amazon, and other companies by integrating audio speakers directly into the glasses temples. The $199.99 Anzu glasses will be available in both rectangular and round frames, and each will come in two sizes: small and large. You can place an order beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dycIDB"&gt;Two sets of lenses come in the retail package: a regular, clear pair that offers 35 percent blocking against blue light, and Razer also throws in sunglass lenses with 99 percent UV protection. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhkyaNLbicec5ulJyrteZpH9ZIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346669/31CDF711_071A_46F5_B442_29A763A11426.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wXFQHa"&gt;But Razer has deviated from competitors with its approach to audio glasses: the company has used a true wireless design that completely splits the left and right speakers. Razer says this allows for improved comfort since the frames allow for more give and flexibility. On the other hand, it could lead to some strange charging situations: you have to charge &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; temples at the same time — there are pogo pins on each one — and could theoretically encounter the occasional true wireless frustrations like audio dropouts on one side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8uPHp"&gt;If you need prescription lenses, Razer has partnered with Lensabl for a 15 percent discount that’s available to Anzu buyers. That’ll obviously end up well above the standard cost, but what are us glasses wearers to do? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IjyMtLATKzm4coPP9P5siIYrb3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22346693/00006ED8_8B4F_45BB_B429_325E48ED8FBE.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DAmgC"&gt;Razer has outfitted each side with a 16mm driver, and there are also touch-responsive tap gestures controls on either temple that will let you change tracks, answer calls, or activate a voice assistant. The Anzu glasses are rated IPX4 for water resistance, so you’ll want to avoid serious rain — but they should handle light splashes okay. Razer says it has cut Bluetooth latency down to 60ms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjkxS6"&gt;The Anzu glasses automatically power down when folded shut — achieving up to two weeks of standby time — and then pair to the last device once opened back up. Battery life is rated at “up to five hours.” That’s about on par with Bose, which estimates 5.5 hours for its Tenor audio sunglasses. As for sound bleed, which is always a side effect with these audio glasses, Razer told me that people within arm’s distance will probably pick up on your music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAHpTX"&gt;The included leatherette case has a magnetic latch and flap for storing the charging cable or extra lenses. The Anzu glasses are exclusively available from &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-wearables%2Frazer-anzu-smart-glasses%2FRZ82-03630800-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; and physical RazerStore locations. In North America, you can get them from Best Buy US and Best Buy Canada. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new Find My feature could let you know if you’re the one being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uu22iw8ZbremJQTbBPB24Di5UwQ=/1006x321:2825x1534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914440/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.42.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KuLOxg"&gt;Apple’s Find My app might get a new safety feature to help prevent someone from using the kinds of devices tracked in the app to stalk you instead. “Item Safety Alerts”, spotted in the iOS 14.5 beta, will notify you if an unknown device being tracked on Find My is “moving with you” so you can remove it or disable it, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/04/ios-14-5-beta-3-changes-features-airtags-find-my-item-safety-alerts-video/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fv8saz"&gt;The feature seems designed to counteract a scenario where a Find My-compatible device is hidden in a pocket or bag and then used to track someone’s movements. The Item Safety Alerts setting was found in early versions of iOS 14.3, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/04/apple-brings-back-airtags-anti-stalking-feature"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but was removed until its reappearance in iOS 14.5. The setting is enabled by default in the beta and Apple seems to want it to stay on. If you turn off the setting off, the system will warn you that unknown devices can see your location without you being notified, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317"&gt;Apple blogger Benjamin Mayo&lt;/a&gt; shared on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZW2Rg5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Something I hadn’t considered before: new beta includes a Item Safety setting in Find My. This is how Apple is trying to prevent 'stalking' with AirTags. If someone secretly hides a tag in your possessions, your phone will notice and warn you about it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/NVJyAZlthw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NVJyAZlthw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Benjamin Mayo (@bzamayo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1367483996905570317?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xsUT0a"&gt;Addressing the risk of stalking in Find My is newly important because of Apple’s plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299712/apple-find-my-iphone-network-third-party-devices-support-location-tracking"&gt;open up the app to third-party accessories&lt;/a&gt;. Hiding an iPhone, iPad, or MacBook in someone’s bag to track them is difficult, but a small keychain-sized device like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile’s upcoming ultra wideband (UWB) tracker&lt;/a&gt; could be a lot easier. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;rumored AirTags&lt;/a&gt; could also be a candidate for misuse, and reintroducing this feature into iOS might mean they’re on their way to release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_tXg8jy9k8c0dG_TGibgzY3HIsU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345924/iOS_14.5_Beta_3_AirTags_Item_Safety_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My settings screen with ‘Item Safety Alerts’ turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="PyrCdp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10318020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyRnzj"&gt;While it’s not necessarily as powerful as a GPS beacon with a cellular radio, Apple’s Find My network may have more reach than you’d think. If an Apple device comes near one of these supported trackers, it can update its location, even if the tracker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647146/apple-find-my-app-tracker-friends-iphone-wwdc-2019"&gt;doesn’t have its own connection to the internet&lt;/a&gt;. Tile’s “Community Find” feature works similarly. AirTags could theoretically expand the reach and precision even more, with an added UWB signal in the tag that can make items easier to find behind walls and in other rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54ZRpg"&gt;There are at least a few examples where gadgets like this have been abused: In 2018, a woman in Texas noticed her ex-partner kept showing up at restaurants, other people’s houses, and even an out-of-town trip, without a clear way of knowing where she was, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/woman-says-ex-used-tile-device-to-stalk-her/3719155/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC 13 &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. She’d later learn her ex had stashed a Tile tracker in the front console of her car, and was using it to find her. A Texas beauty queen shared &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/texas-beauty-queen-claims-stranger-targeted-tracking-device/story?id=38749046"&gt;a similar stalking story in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile saw Verizon telling people to turn off 5G and thought ‘why stop there’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UkcxUWzk2ZeM4_98vTRtJWUIEs4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68914288/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMvZYc"&gt;T-Mobile has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;busy hawking its 5G network&lt;/a&gt;, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;spending many additional billions to expand it&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it &lt;em&gt;kinda&lt;/em&gt; awkward that it’s also been caught telling users to turn off 5G to save battery life (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/saschasegan/status/1367473288398729223?s=20"&gt;via Sascha Segan&lt;/a&gt;). Didn’t Verizon just make this same gaff mere days ago? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/28/22305899/verizon-support-turn-off-5g-save-phone-battery"&gt;It sure did&lt;/a&gt;. But instead of learning from the example, T-Mobile appears to have pulled a hold-my-beer: where Verizon told users to switch to LTE, many of T-Mobile’s support documents tell users to go &lt;em&gt;all the way back to 2G.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOpONa"&gt;In case you’re not aware, switching to 2G (which T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fnetwork-apn-and-volte-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%23steps3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;handily tells you how to do&lt;/a&gt;) will make your phone next to useless as a data device: the maximum theoretical speed you could get from a 2G connection would be around 1Mbps (though many top out at closer to 256Kbps). Even 1Mbps is 25 times slower than what the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;FTC considers to be acceptable broadband speeds&lt;/a&gt;, and 300 times slower than &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Ffast-mid-band-5g-new-cities-towns-location-coverage&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the average 5G mid-band speeds T-Mobile has bragged about&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6Y0X"&gt;(Never mind that T-Mobile is also in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;phasing out 2G signals &lt;em&gt;for good&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, though the 2G shutdown has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/05/t-mobile-3g-shutdown-reportedly-delayed-until-2022/"&gt;been postponed to 2022&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2lAUs"&gt;T-Mobile probably realized that this kind of advice was not a great look, but the company’s cover-up has also been amusingly slow. Earlier today, it removed the “Toggle from 5G/LTE to 2G” advice from the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; example &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-like-verizon-also-tells-users-to-turn-off-5g-to-save-on-battery"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Magazine&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt;), and the second one (the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s21-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 5G&lt;/a&gt;) had its support page updated shortly before we wrote these words. It also didn’t take long to find the advice to turn off 5G and/or 4G on the pages for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Flg-wing%2Fbattery-life-lg-wing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Foneplus-nord-n10-5g%2Fbattery-life-oneplus-nord-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g%2Fbattery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy S20+ 5G&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fdevices%2Fandroid%2Fgoogle-pixel-4a-5g%2Fbattery-life-google-pixel-4a-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22314138%2Ft-mobile-turn-off-5g-for-2g-support-documents-battery-savings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; (which weirdly only mentions turning off 4G, not 5G). That’s likely an incomplete list, but you get the picture: the nudge to pick T-Mobile’s slow 2G network showed up a bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIVMBH"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9luReeBj72AJ:https://www.t-mobile.com/support/devices/android/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g/battery-life-samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;Here’s a Google Cache version&lt;/a&gt; of the first T-Mobile support page from March 1st.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKbNQI"&gt;I will say that T-Mobile is right in one way: turning my phone down to 2G would likely make it so slow that I’d just give up trying to use it, and my phone probably would last a lot longer. If you’re struggling with battery life on your phone, there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20698309/android-phone-batter-save-drain-how-to"&gt;plenty of things you can try&lt;/a&gt; that don’t involve slamming the brakes quite that hard.&lt;/p&gt;
