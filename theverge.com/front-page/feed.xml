    <title>Game of Thrones showrunners are producing a Netflix adaptation of The Overstory with Hugh Jackman</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvA65S"&gt;David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, the creators and showrunners of HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, have a new project in the works with Netflix that will see the duo team up with actor Hugh Jackman to executive produce an adaptation of the 2018 novel &lt;em&gt;The Overstory&lt;/em&gt;. The novel, from author Richard Powers, is a work of environmental fiction centered on the lives of a group of individuals and how their experiences relate to a distinct set of trees and the movement to preserve and protect nature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtgCdE"&gt;Benioff and Weiss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20761099/game-of-thrones-david-benioff-db-weiss-netflix-deal-200-million-disney-stars"&gt;inked a deal with Netflix in 2019&lt;/a&gt; worth a reported $250 million to bring new shows to the platform. &lt;em&gt;The Overstory &lt;/em&gt;adaptation will be the duo’s third after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410210/netflix-the-three-body-problem-benioff-weiss-adapation"&gt;adaptation of Liu Cixin’s sci-fi trilogy The Remembrance of Earth’s Past&lt;/a&gt; (perhaps better known by its first entry, &lt;em&gt;The Three-Body Problem&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/holland-taylor-sandra-oh-jay-duplass-netflix-dramedy-series-the-chair-1234673561/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chair&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new six-part series from showrunner Amanda Peet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b5ZCke"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Overstory is being developed as a series by David Benioff &amp;amp; D.B. Weiss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Richard Powers’ novel is a sweeping work of activism and resistance about a magnificently inventive world that a handful of people learn how to see and are drawn into &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wn0VTlFWcU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wn0VTlFWcU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Queue (@netflixqueue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixqueue/status/1359902772443836417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WB81JI"&gt;Jackman is reportedly a fan of the novel, as is Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/game-of-thrones-creators-set-third-netflix-show-the-overstory?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The book won the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, and Netflix describes the novel as “a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of the natural world” in its announcement post. “It tells the story of a world alongside ours that is vast, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive and almost invisible to us,” the announcement goes on to say. “A handful of disparate people learn how to see that world and are drawn into its unfolding catastrophe.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-68" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get them for $120 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731722633239801630" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OGXtAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Uv43TD"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Pro review: the perfect earbuds for the iPhone|73652" data-volume-uuid="c840e1e11" data-volume-id="73652" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-362" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a new pair, the lowest price you can get them for currently is $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are down to $180 at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ADVaKJ741skd2nYKH2QlBnCa0F0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805342/akrales_191030_3763_0446.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWNZQd"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, Apple’s AirPods Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;are possibly the best option out there&lt;/a&gt;. If you have been holding off on buying the AirPods Pro, hoping for a significant price drop, your time has come: Apple’s flagship wireless earbuds are just $180 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now. That’s $69 off the usual $249 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLpNMN"&gt;While this is not the lowest price we have seen these earbuds go for, the AirPods Pro rarely get marked down to anything lower than $190, making this an exceptional deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm8acq"&gt;Among other advantages, the AirPods Pro offer a customizable fit that includes three different silicone ear tip sizes, making it easier for them to fit in your ears. The standard AirPods come with a “one size fits most” design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="04LGOU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBZb6"&gt;If you’re looking for a pair of AirPods but aren’t interested in the Pro model, Amazon currently has one of the better deals on the regular AirPods. For $110, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a second-generation pair with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied at checkout). For $50 more, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pair that includes a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned you can turn off Reddit’s obnoxious app install pop-up with a simple checkbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C-Qm-_GlVAZiMEUv7vVoamTXkyU=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805262/reddit_notice.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cyQLq"&gt;My preferred way to surf Reddit is via the mobile website. It lets me quickly check a few of my favorite subreddits to see which posts are bubbling up. Since I’m not usually logged in, it helps me manage my screen time, too; you can only scroll down so far in comment threads until Reddit prompts you to enter your username and password. I take that as a sign that I’ve scrolled far enough and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoZAs2"&gt;I have one big complaint with the mobile site, though: it constantly shoves a large banner into my face suggesting that I abandon all of that and install the app instead. Here’s a picture of that banner from my phone, which you may have seen before:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zJIAB6u1S5Qun3O23-lPK_NBfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293538/IMG_0199.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, I don’t want to view the page in the app, thanks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w4QXTm"&gt;Typically, I just close the prompt to make it go away, but sooner or later, it reappears, requiring me to close it again and again and again. The cycle never ends — or so I thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wge8Vx"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/09/you-can-disable-reddits-maddening-open-in-app-popup-once-and-for-all/"&gt;thanks to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I learned I can disable that pop-up forever. It’s actually very easy to turn off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="14kbPU"&gt;On Reddit’s mobile website, tap the three-line / hamburger menu at the top right of the screen&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="neV51s"&gt;You’ll be shown a number of options. Tap “Settings” near the bottom. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7qe5El"&gt;Uncheck the box for “Ask To Open In App.” That’s it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KywCTphqO2_guXkM4bmIc2Vd99U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293552/IMG_0202.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncheck the “Ask To Open In App” option to banish the banner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SdvnFP"&gt;This isn’t a new solution — &lt;em&gt;TNW&lt;/em&gt; wrote about it back &lt;a href="https://thenextweb.com/basics/2018/11/21/how-to-stop-reddits-annoying-app-download-prompt/"&gt;in November 2018&lt;/a&gt; — and if you delete your browsing history or go to Reddit in incognito mode, you’ll have to turn the prompt off again. But thanks to this simple tweak, my mobile Reddit browsing experience has already changed for the better. I hope it can for you, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clapper permanently bans QAnon-related content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFkydbGqJVso58iMfGeZX2a3ztw=/69x0:444x250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805236/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clapper&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wos5kw"&gt;Clapper has moved to ban accounts spreading QAnon conspiracy theories and vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254411/clapper-parler-gab-qanon-tiktok-free-speech"&gt;in the wake of a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; report last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d1FOEl"&gt;Clapper CEO Edison Chen told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday that the company will permanently ban QAnon-related content going forward. As of publication, Chen said Clapper has removed over 400 videos and 20 accounts for spreading QAnon or anti-vax misinformation and has increased its number of content auditors from around a dozen to 20. It will take Clapper up to 10 days to complete a full audit of its over 1 million videos, Chen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3eo0QV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“From today, if additional users were to post QAnon-related content, it will be removed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWUW5X"&gt;“We take this matter very seriously,” Chen said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Thursday. “After investigating, we decided to take action to remove and ban accounts regarding QAnon and mis-info about vaccines… which are against our mission.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKOwRL"&gt;Chen continued, “From today, if additional users were to post QAnon-related content, it will be removed. We have zero tolerance about QAnon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyx3oh"&gt;Clapper launched last July as a “Free Speech Short video” app, mimicking platforms like TikTok but with less content moderation. After January’s deadly attack at the Capitol, QAnon content was largely banished from social media. The “free speech” platform Parler, which had a largely conservative-leaning user base, was forced offline by its web hosts after failing to respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;reports of violent threats on its platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD6AOL"&gt;Like Parler, Clapper became a popular app for conservatives who disagreed with the content moderation decisions of large tech companies like Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; report found that some QAnon Clapper users were able to build large followings using hashtags like #thestorm and #thegreatawakening. One Q-related account identified by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, belonging to Clapper user Josh Sardam, appears to have been removed as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtTfKY"&gt;Clapper’s QAnon ban puts the smaller platform’s policies in line with those at larger tech platforms like Facebook and TikTok. Last October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;Facebook moved&lt;/a&gt; to completely ban QAnon, calling it a “militarized social movement.” Other platforms, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522896/tiktok-removing-accounts-qanon-conspiracy-social-media"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, have also decided to ban the content outright in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Kingdom Hearts series comes to PC as an Epic Store exclusive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FhdmosGJ0mL84q_tJLV_C8J8e-0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805129/90.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CnRcD2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;, Square Enix’s action roleplaying mashup of Square Enix, Disney, and Pixar characters, is coming to PC for the first time. The series will be available as an &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/discover/kingdom-hearts"&gt;Epic Store&lt;/a&gt; exclusive on March 30th, the company announced today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7mxZf"&gt;Titles include &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&lt;/em&gt; — enhanced versions of &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory&lt;/em&gt;. Although the series has spanned a variety of platforms, from its beginnings as a PlayStation title to its arrival on Xbox consoles and handhelds for many of the series’ spinoffs, it has never made the leap to PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rt7aX8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Just announced &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The iconic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KINGDOMHEARTS&lt;/a&gt; Series is coming to PC for the first time ever on March 30th!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you ready to join Sora and friends in their battle against the darkness? Pre-order all the titles in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KINGDOMHEARTS&lt;/a&gt; series starting today  &lt;a href="https://t.co/nUKDdLoEcZ"&gt;https://t.co/nUKDdLoEcZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RgcfVk3CFA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RgcfVk3CFA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Epic Games Store (@EpicGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1359941547345739777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v76kqI"&gt;The series follows Sora as he travels with companions Donald Duck and Goofy through worlds based on Disney classics.&lt;em&gt; Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;, which acts as the conclusion to Sora’s adventure, launched for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThY0Jy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&lt;/em&gt; is available for $49.99, while the other three games are $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See how libraries are meeting ebook demand for the NYT Best Sellers list with this visualization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyKZSvtsAdaHih9ptz2PEMkbybU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68805091/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5F4laT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/17/2945779/5-minutes-on-the-verge-robin-sloan"&gt;Fiction author&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/6/16257364/robin-sloan-sourdough-mr-penumbras-24-hour-bookstore-interview-silicon-valley"&gt;sourdough bread lover&lt;/a&gt;, and former Twitter executive Robin Sloan is answering a question you may have never thought to ask: which &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;Best Sellers list&lt;/a&gt; ebooks are in the highest demand in the US public library system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn1E0r"&gt;Sloan created &lt;a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/library-demand-list/"&gt;an interactive visualization&lt;/a&gt; that lets you see how many people are on the waitlist to “borrow” a digital copy of a book (known as “holds”) and compare that against how many “copies” a library actually owns. Some are perhaps more popular than the libraries were prepared for! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L8bTa"&gt;I’m using air quotes because while digital goods are infinite, there’s a whole system in place that lets libraries continue to lend books (and their creators continue to get paid) as if they had a limited number of physical copies. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t__I1_SyhMW_Tqld88nQcoh0Sxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297742/library_book_holds_nyt_bestseller_list_sloan.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="46z7mQ"&gt;If you page through Sloan’s visualization, you can also see that library patrons aren’t necessarily most interested in the books at the very top of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s list&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;The Vanishing Half&lt;/em&gt; has the most holds and the most copies available, despite being No. 6 at the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; in sales. You have to hover over titles to see those rankings, though; there’s no button to reorder Sloan’s list, only scale the size of each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f84Mc4"&gt;“I think these views of the NYT list are interesting because library e-book lending has exploded in the past few years, and now constitutes a very important channel for reading in the United States; it feels worthwhile to try to understand how its patterns both mirror and diverge from book buying,” writes Sloan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzhfmK"&gt;Sloan is being cagey about how he got the data, but he says he’ll continue to update this with new data through February 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Black will play the snarky robot Claptrap in the Borderlands movie</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tenacious D Perform In Milan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k1gfXqzJexj4UdexHiAY4ZZewCU=/0x0:8660x5773/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804827/1207441412.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Francesco Prandoni/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaxfXA"&gt;Jack Black is set to play snarky robot Claptrap in the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jack-black-joins-cate-blanchett-in-borderlands-movie"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/jack-black-eli-roth-cate-blanchett-borderlands-lionsgate-1234692217/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/jack-black-borderlands-movie-claptrap-1234906098/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and other publications. He joins what’s turning out to be an all-star cast, which also includes Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Hart, and Cate Blanchett.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6kN8J"&gt;The movie will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145855/borderlands-film-eli-roth-gearbox-live-action-adaptation-direct"&gt;directed by Eli Roth&lt;/a&gt;, who most recently directed &lt;em&gt;The House with a Clock in Its Walls&lt;/em&gt;, which Blanchett and Black also starred in. “I am so excited to reunite with Jack, this time in the recording booth,” he said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;. “&lt;em&gt;Claptrap&lt;/em&gt; is the funniest character in the game, and Jack is perfect to bring him to the big screen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI59a8"&gt;If you ask me, Black’s wild exuberance is a perfect match for the robot’s quippy in-game persona. If you haven’t played the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; series before, just watch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/K3R3iBwGTKA"&gt;this compilation&lt;/a&gt; of some of Claptrap’s best quotes from the second game to get an idea of the role Black is gearing up for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="orip7B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; movie adaptation has been in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/28/9220215/borderlands-movie-being-made"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. Blanchett is set to play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Lilith"&gt;Lilith&lt;/a&gt;, Curtis will play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Patricia_Tannis"&gt;Tannis&lt;/a&gt;, and Kevin Hart will play &lt;a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Roland#"&gt;Roland&lt;/a&gt;. Craig Mazin, who co-created &lt;em&gt;Chernobyl &lt;/em&gt;and is a writer and executive producer on HBO’s take on &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us, &lt;/em&gt;is writing the &lt;em&gt;Borderlands&lt;/em&gt; script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVdVMt"&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt;, the casting for Joel and Ellie was just announced on Wednesday: Pedro Pascal (who plays the titular character in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277687/mandalorian-star-pedro-pascal-joel-hbo-the-last-of-us-tv-show"&gt;will play Joel&lt;/a&gt;, and Bella Ramsey (who starred as the beloved Lyanna Mormont in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22277372/the-last-of-us-ellie-game-of-thrones-bella-ramsey-hbo-lyanna-mormont"&gt;will play Ellie&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Biden administration is working to help address global semiconductor chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Intel Skylake chip shots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/buVJNS_Gq-1EHLukwJ_YiaSmL-4=/2x0:1018x677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804655/vs09-02_0831cxs-2.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QvVeEE"&gt;The White House has pledged to help address the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, with President Joe Biden said to be signing an executive order to conduct a supply chain review along with developing a long-term strategy to avoid future shortages, &lt;a href="https://www.bloombergquint.com/global-economics/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28CjUx"&gt;The cause of the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html"&gt;current shortage&lt;/a&gt; is due to a mixture of factors: spikes in demand for consumer electronic products like laptops due to changes in lifestyle caused by the COVID-19 pandemic; slowdowns in chip production also caused by the pandemic; a business model in the semiconductor industry that sees most companies outsource chip production to firms like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) instead of building the parts themselves; and lingering effects from former President Donald Trump’s trade war with China that made it harder for US companies to work with Chinese chip producers.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Cx1fji"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shortage impacts everything from PS5s to Ford F-150s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhqzaw"&gt;The result is companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD’s newest CPUs and GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKuE0s"&gt;But in today’s increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies — including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota — have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford just announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vt74t"&gt;To that end, the Biden administration is reportedly working with businesses and trade partners to try to alleviate some of these issues. And while it’s good to see the US government looking to address the issue, the United States’ limited involvement in physical semiconductor manufacturing makes its actual avenues toward addressing the issue unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook has doubled bullying and harassment takedowns since last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cShX-nRuDt2XKF7-OLPXERpVPKM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68804462/akrales_180614_1777_0110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qvBCj7"&gt;On Thursday, Facebook released a new moderation transparency report showing a marked uptick in bullying and harassment enforcement, which reached a peak of 6.3 million total takedowns through the last quarter of 2020. It’s an increase from 3.5 million pieces last quarter and 2.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The company said much of the change is due to improvements in the automated systems that analyze Facebook and Instagram comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nktvmz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://transparency.facebook.com/"&gt;Facebook’s latest transparency report&lt;/a&gt; covers October to December 2020, a period that includes the US presidential election. During that time, the main Facebook network removed more harassment, organized hate and hate speech, and suicide and self-harm content. Instagram saw significant jumps in bullying and self-harm removals. The company says its numbers were shaped by two factors: more human review capacity and improvements in artificial intelligence, especially for non-English posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iC0a94"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re investing in technology across all the different sorts of ways that people share.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5HcL5t"&gt;The company also indicates it will lean on automation to address a growing amount of video and audio on its platforms, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;rumored Clubhouse competitor&lt;/a&gt;. “We’re investing in technology across all the different sorts of ways that people share,” said CTO Mike Schroepfer on a call with reporters. “We understand audio, video, we understand the content around those things, who shared it, and build a broader picture of what’s happening there.” Facebook hasn’t confirmed the existence of a Clubhouse-like audio platform, but “I think there’s a lot we’re doing here that can apply to these different formats, and we obviously look at how the products are changing and invest ahead of those changes to make sure we have the technological tools we need,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxNSHh"&gt;Facebook pushed some moderation teams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497789/facebook-content-moderators-accenture-return-office-coronavirus"&gt;back&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530428/facebook-moderators-dublin-work-in-office-ireland-lockdown-covid-19"&gt;into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525600/facebook-moderators-india-covid-19-office-return-work-safety-health-concern"&gt;offices&lt;/a&gt; in early October; although it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573526/facebook-content-moderators-open-letter-coronavirus-protections-demands-accenture"&gt;said in November&lt;/a&gt; that most moderators worked remotely, it’s also said that some sensitive content can’t be reviewed from home. Now, the company says increased moderation has helped Facebook and Instagram remove more suicide and self-injury posts. Facebook removed 2.5 million pieces of violating content, compared to 1.3 million pieces the preceding quarter, and Instagram removed 3.4 million pieces, up from 1.3 million. That’s comparable to pre-pandemic levels for Facebook, and it’s a significant absolute increase for Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XGa0lr"&gt;Conversely, Facebook attributes some increases to AI-powered moderation. It removed 6.3 million pieces of bullying and harassing content on Facebook, for instance, which is nearly double the numbers from previous quarters. On Instagram, it removed 5 million pieces of content, up from 2.6 million pieces last quarter and 1.5 million pieces at the end of 2019. Those increases stem from tech that better analyzes comments in the context of the accompanying post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhU9kw"&gt;Non-English language moderation has been a historic weak point for Facebook, and the company says it has improved AI language detection in Arabic, Spanish, and Portuguese, fueling a hate speech takedown increase from 22.1 million to 26.9 million pieces. That’s not as big as the jump Facebook saw in late 2019, however, when it made what it described as dramatic improvements to its automated detection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y5weeoGCJ2W-qcvXGHXGCqjbo5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22297416/Screen_Shot_2021_02_11_at_11.32.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook hate speech takedowns between Q4 2017 and Q4 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5IU0VL"&gt;Facebook says it’s changed its News Feed in ways that reduce the amount of hate speech and violent content people see. A survey of hate speech in the third quarter found that users averaged between 10 and 11 pieces of hate speech for every 10,000 pieces of content; in the fourth quarter, that dropped to seven or eight pieces. The company said it was still formulating responses to some suggestions from the Facebook Oversight Board, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;released its first decisions last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e8Cser"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We think that regulation would be a very good thing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oMdcWu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575139/facebook-moderation-ai-hate-speech"&gt;As it did last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook suggested lawmakers could use its transparency report as the model for a legal framework. Facebook has supported changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a broad liability shield that has come under fire from critics of social media. “We think that regulation would be a very good thing,” said Monika Bickert, VP of content policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvqOHX"&gt;However, Facebook has not backed a specific legislative proposal — including the SAFE TECH Act, a sweeping rollback proposed in Congress last week. “We remain committed to having this dialogue with everybody in the United States who is working on finding a way forward with regulation,” said Bickert. “We’ve obviously seen a number of proposals in this area, and we’ve seen different focuses from different people on the Hill in terms of what they want to pursue, and we want to make sure that we are part of all those conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;
