    <title>A new app allows teachers to use their iPhone or iPad as an overhead camera on Zoom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the app that shows it acting as an overhead camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4PLvwcOTk0J0iTFrJEFy5eVDh-Y=/0x1733:1600x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68629107/iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABkAAAArwCAYAAAD8ZvemAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAJ8WlUWHRYTUw6Y29tLmFkb2Jl_2_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD8eq4"&gt;Teachers who have found themselves holding class over Zoom have probably already figured out clever hacks to show their students documents, but there’s now an app designed specifically for that purpose (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/06/iphone-document-camera-overviewer-zoom"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Overviewer was made by developer Charlie Chapman, and it allows teachers (or anyone, really) to easily use their phone’s camera as a replacement for an overhead document viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyB2Z3"&gt;If it’s been a minute since you were a student, or if your school didn’t have these overhead devices, they’re basically webcams pointing straight down that allow teachers to show students a printed document, book, hand drawing, or other piece of writing or image. It’s a useful ability to have, but many teachers are working from home because of COVID and may not have access to one like they would in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Top-down view of a printed book, shown in a Zoom call" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lOMkD7BgbF4qsARgKTu2WSOXNC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217793/Screen_Shot_2021_01_06_at_9.24.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participants in the Zoom call only see what your phone’s camera sees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wdoQAj"&gt;Overviewer works as a replacement by taking advantage of Zoom’s built-in screen sharing feature that &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201379235-Sharing-your-screen-iOS-with-the-Zoom-Desktop-Client"&gt;works with the iPhone when its connected to a computer&lt;/a&gt; with a Lightning cable, or wirelessly through AirPlay (at the moment, it doesn’t seem like Zoom offers this feature for Android users). It shows a feed from your phone’s camera on the screen, with nothing else getting in the way. The feature also offers the ability to turn your phone’s flashlight on if your lighting situation isn’t ideal, as well as the option to change which camera is being displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PLQyQW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://charliemchapman.com/posts/2021/6/overviewer/"&gt;In a heartwarming blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how he developed the app for his wife, who works as a kindergarten teacher, Chapman explains how he saw his wife using iOS’s built-in camera app to do the same thing, and how she was frustrated by the lack of landscape support and all the buttons overlaid on-screen: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yr4Ppv"&gt;So being the dorky husband that I am, I quickly built an app that does nothing other than show what the phone camera sees with zero chrome, and properly rotates the whole app so that you can share it in landscape on zoom. This did the trick and she actually used it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y6IyY"&gt;It’s pretty tailor made for exactly my wife’s use case but I would think that would be a pretty common one for teachers to be in right now in our current virtual teaching world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3EdVoS"&gt;If you’re a teacher, or are thinking of some other use for the app, it’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1528900395"&gt;available for free on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s worth noting that if you’re using a Mac, Zoom will ask for permission to record your screen and have to be restarted in order to share your phone’s screen (this is because Zoom is just displaying your phone’s screen on your computer, and then capturing that window).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52K48v"&gt;For more information on how the app works, the developer has made a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fadOMMpQErg&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;how-to video&lt;/a&gt;, which you can watch below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IBH0TN"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fadOMMpQErg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $58 today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DVSQpAjx8f2Q4yAofLfOJirplqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628804/vpavic_4261_20201023_0104.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kL1fDL"&gt;If you were gifted a PS5 over the holidays or still own a PS4 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership, you can snag two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions at Eneba&lt;/a&gt; for $58 when you enter the discount code &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout (while supplies last). Usually, one year of PlayStation Plus would set you back $60, so getting two one-year subscriptions for less than the normal retail price is a real bargain, and this promotion will likely sell out quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQj3JL"&gt;Ideally, this is great for a PS4 or PS5 user looking to stack up on PlayStation Plus subscriptions for the next two years, or if you want to gift one PlayStation Plus membership to a friend and keep the other one for yourself. If you don’t need more than one PlayStation Plus membership, Eneba has another promotion allowing you to buy &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one year for just $30&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;strong&gt;JANDEALS. &lt;/strong&gt;Otherwise, it’s $31 without the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MQwTru"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WuHKu4"&gt;When testing out the deal, I found that the &lt;strong&gt;2021PLUS &lt;/strong&gt;discount code will only work if you have two PlayStation Plus one-year subscriptions in your cart. The codes are also region-locked, so you will need a US PlayStation Network account to redeem the membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCXwka"&gt;PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that usually switch up on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yJ1Yx"&gt;Additionally, PS5 owners receive an additional incentive for having an active PlayStation Plus subscription: access to the PlayStation Plus Collection, a digital library of “generation-defining” first- and third-party games that were released on the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; God of War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10’s taskbar is getting a big update with new weather and news widget</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_s6sLof4IpuTYrkn6EdvdUBGIg=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628671/windows10newtaskbar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 10 taskbar feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsJ8oy"&gt;Microsoft is making a big change to its Windows 10 taskbar soon, with the addition of a news and weather widget. The new feature is available to testers today, and it will allow Windows 10 users to access a feed of news, stocks, and weather information straight from the taskbar. You’ll be able to quickly glance at the weather without having to open the Start menu, install a third-party app, or check online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMEstS"&gt;The taskbar feature will pop out into a mini feed of content that can be personalized with the latest sports news, headlines, and weather information. Microsoft is using its Microsoft News network to surface news and content from more than 4,500 sources. The company has been curating this through artificial intelligence in recent months, and this particular feature will also learn what news is relevant to you when you dismiss or like stories in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xgJePA2zr0NxBXfhmVoFAsNbjLY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217675/News_and_interests_video.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new taskbar widget includes weather and news information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Nxy2lI"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test this new feature with its Windows Insiders on the dev channel of Windows 10 today, and it will likely be available to all users later this year. It will only be initially available to testers in the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and India. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3sm4K"&gt;This new taskbar feature will also require Microsoft’s Chromium-based Edge to be installed on a PC. That means any link you click within the feature will force you into Edge to read it, and Microsoft is presenting content in the reading view by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMt6N"&gt;You can of course disable this new taskbar feature, and Microsoft says it will be an ad-free experience. It does appear to be more useful than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/28/15474608/microsoft-windows-10-my-people-integration-feature"&gt;People Bar that Microsoft built into Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago. The People Bar acts as a quick way to access contacts, but it only supports apps like Mail and Skype and not big third-party messaging services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo once laughed Xbox execs out of the room over a Microsoft acquisition offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkzBtoTAO7WkHgb-ZaadulKbpq8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628599/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BESlMO"&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox consoles are considered a pillar of the industry, part of a trifecta that makes up modern gaming. The first Xbox launched in 2001; the Xbox Series X and S arrived just last year. Today, Xbox is a powerhouse, yet it wasn’t always so. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-06/xbox-the-oral-history-of-an-american-video-game-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s Dina Bass published an oral history on the creation of Microsoft’s Xbox that recounts the console’s conception, from an executive retreat through release day — with snags like a failed bid at Nintendo detailed along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ncx0EK"&gt;The original Xbox was known as Midway — or Coffin Box to some, according to Xbox technology officer Seamus Blackley, “because they worried that it would fail and end their career at Microsoft.” As part of an effort to lock in exclusive games, Microsoft tried to acquire companies like Electronic Arts, Midway Games, and Square. Kevin Bachus, director of third-party relations, says that president and later Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer also made the team meet with Nintendo. Their pitch revolved around the technical powers of the Xbox. It did not go as planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uew2dv"&gt;“They just laughed their asses off,” Bachus told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “Like, imagine an hour of somebody just laughing at you. That was kind of how that meeting went.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0GnST"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-06/xbox-the-oral-history-of-an-american-video-game-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s story&lt;/a&gt; goes on to explore the console’s actual achievements, including its successful bid for &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;creator Bungie. The full piece is well worth a read, especially for the anecdote about an unnamed Konami executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lu9xQk"&gt;As for Nintendo, chairman of Nintendo America Howard Lincoln told the publication that  the company “does not talk about confidential discussions with other companies. In any event, nothing came of these discussions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NniyCM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1PzsS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix on the Wii U and 3DS will shut down on June 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Wii U GamePad (555px)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKGlru1_IBtpqOHJSJb8MEPsnZY=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628525/DSC_2612-555px.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0D2EL1"&gt;Nintendo is winding down support for the Netflix app on the Wii U and 3DS. The app will be shut down for existing users on June 30th, and if you’ve never downloaded it, it isn’t available anymore. You can redownload the app if you’ve downloaded it in the past, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgGTD1"&gt;“Starting Dec 31st, 2020, the Netflix app will no longer be available for new users to download from Nintendo eShop on the Wii U console or Nintendo 3DS family of systems,” Nintendo said in a statement on the listings for the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-wii-u/"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/netflix-3ds/"&gt;3DS&lt;/a&gt; Netflix app. “During that time, it will be possible for existing users to re-download these applications. Service for existing users will continue until June 30th, 2021. Thank you to everyone who enjoyed Netflix on these platforms over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfGfzo"&gt;Nintendo discontinued the 3DS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21441096/nintendo-3ds-production-discontinued-total-sales"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt; and quickly moved on from the Wii U in favor of the Nintendo Switch, so it’s not all that surprising that the company is shutting down the Netflix app on the older platforms. But Netflix still isn’t on the Switch, despite former Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé saying days after the Switch’s launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/8/14852624/nintendo-switch-netflix-hulu-amazon-support"&gt;in March 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the company was talking with companies like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon about bringing their services to the console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI69ww"&gt;Hulu launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/11/16633818/nintendo-switch-hulu-app-perfectly-good-streaming-gadget"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s still no Netflix app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump administration finalizes rule that could define gig workers as contractors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AdYcyX1SsRN16FZ3CGKudTSIosM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628412/akrales_180614_1777_0235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MM2xjF"&gt;The US Department of Labor has finalized a decision that could make it easier for “gig economy” companies to classify their workers as independent contractors, rather than employees that can claim legal benefits. The Trump administration released its &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/releases/whd/whd20210106"&gt;final version&lt;/a&gt; of the rule today, and it’s set to take effect on March 8th, although this could change after President-elect Joe Biden takes office in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFJatD"&gt;The DOL proposed a &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/dol-debuts-rule-to-ease-employers-use-of-independent-contractors"&gt;new framework&lt;/a&gt; last year for classifying employees and contractors. It &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/2021-independent-contractor"&gt;focuses on&lt;/a&gt; two “core factors” for distinguishing the two: the “nature and degree of control over the work” and the “opportunity for profit or loss” based on initiative and investment. It also lists additional “guideposts” that include “the amount of skill required” for the job, the “degree of permanence” of the working relationship, and whether the work is part of an “integrated unit of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7YxND"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/business/economy/labor-gig-workers.html"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; last year, the rule is interpreting existing regulations rather than establishing new ones, and it only covers federal laws enforced by the DOL. States can still establish their own definitions — like California’s Prop 22, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174600/uber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy"&gt;which specifies&lt;/a&gt; that Lyft and Uber drivers aren’t employees. However, it could still broadly influence how companies define their workers. The nonprofit labor rights group National Employment Law Project called it a “narrowing” of the standards rather than a meaningful clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVHc2X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjK9RZ"&gt;Charlie Harding, the host of the podcast &lt;em&gt;Switched On Pop&lt;/em&gt;, noticed something strange when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/charlieharding/status/1346584298330099712?s=21"&gt;he searched his podcast name on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; yesterday: a price tag. An $8.95 price, to be exact, marked as a “limited deal” with the suggestion to buy an Audible subscription to get a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHYZoP"&gt;Harding’s show, which details the making and meaning of popular music, is already freely available in all podcast apps through an RSS feed. It also recently became available for free inside Audible, which is owned by Amazon, when podcasts were added to its app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536963/amazon-free-podcast-update-catalog"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. But for some reason, Amazon had started advertising the show as paid content. Even more strangely, the Audible promotion was really for a price &lt;em&gt;hike&lt;/em&gt;, marking the show as originally costing $0 and being marked up to $8.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9z5WWz"&gt;The same happened with other podcasts available in Audible, too. All the ones we checked, including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, which is freely distributed through RSS, were listed as costing $8.95 and promoted an Audible membership deal. These results only showed up on Amazon’s website, not in the mobile app, and only if you were logged into an Amazon account when you searched. If you clicked on the podcast, you’d then be able to select where you wanted to listen, either Amazon Music or Audible, and you could listen for free without a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoLoVw"&gt;The pricing disappeared Wednesday morning after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out for comment. Amazon has not yet responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0MjXK"&gt;It’s unclear why Amazon marked the shows as costing $8.95 given that none of Audible’s subscription tiers are that price. Its lowest tier, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398875/audible-plus-premium-subscription-membership-plan-credit"&gt;launched in August&lt;/a&gt;, costs $7.95 for access to these free shows, as well as exclusive Audible programming and audiobooks. The price goes up to $14.95 for a subscription that includes audiobook credits. This seems more than likely to be a bug given that the shows’ prices were raised instead of lowered as part of this “limited deal,” but still, it’s not a great look for Amazon, which just recently started focusing on podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCc8FP"&gt;The addition of podcasts is part of Audible’s latest push to sell subscriptions. The freely available shows add value to a costly subscription and bulk up its catalog, which might entice people to pay every month for access. It’s worth remembering, though, that most podcasts are available for free through RSS, not when you pay Audible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo says it’s ditching the term ‘self-driving’ in dig at Tesla</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3bidMzhIue2_bIFxcH6p0xgwYA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628280/waymo_chrysler_pacifica_detroit_auto_show_2017_0547.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GzZDhH"&gt;Waymo is saying so long to “self-driving.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpEG20"&gt;The Google sister company says it is through using the term “self-driving cars” to describe its fleet of autonomous vehicles. And it is subtly pointing fingers at Elon Musk’s Tesla as the reason why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqJJxk"&gt;Waymo says it is committing to “using more deliberate language” in its marketing, educational, and promotional materials going forward. This means the company will no longer refer to its vehicles as “self-driving,” Waymo says. For example, the company is changing the name of its three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16447628/waymo-self-driving-car-ad-campaign-arizona"&gt;public education campaign&lt;/a&gt; from “Let’s Talk Self-Driving” to “Let’s Talk Autonomous Driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EuA8uY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It may seem like a small change, but it’s an important one, because precision in language matters and could save lives.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIvYbG"&gt;“It may seem like a small change, but it’s an important one, because precision in language matters and could save lives,” the company wrote in a blog post published on January 5th. “We’re hopeful that consistency will help differentiate the fully autonomous technology Waymo is developing from driver-assist technologies (sometimes erroneously referred to as ‘self-driving’ technologies) that require oversight from licensed human drivers for safe operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJqYaj"&gt;The references to driver-assist technologies appears to be a shot at Tesla, which last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;activated a software update&lt;/a&gt; in some of its cars called “Full Self Driving.” The software, which enables drivers to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets, is still technically in beta. But an unknown number of white-listed drivers have received it and have been actively testing it on public roads — often filming and uploading those tests on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMioer"&gt;Tesla has said Full Self-Driving should only be used by attentive drivers with both hands on the wheel. But the feature is designed to assist a driver, and it’s not foolproof: there have been several high-profile incidents in which some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/30/12072408/tesla-autopilot-car-crash-death-autonomous-model-s"&gt;drivers have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/23/16923800/tesla-firetruck-crash-autopilot-investigation"&gt;engaged Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17182824/tesla-model-x-crash-autopilot-statement"&gt; crashed&lt;/a&gt;, and died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjOyhI"&gt;Waymo never mentions Tesla by name in the blog post. But the Alphabet company is clearly motivated by Musk’s controversial decision to use the term “Full Self Driving” in deciding to more rigorously police its own language. A key paragraph in the post reads (emphasis ours):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="h3513l"&gt;This is more than just a branding or linguistic exercise. Unfortunately, we see that some automakers use the term “self-driving” in an inaccurate way, giving consumers and the general public a false impression of the capabilities of driver assist (not fully autonomous) technology. &lt;strong&gt;That false impression can lead someone to unknowingly take risks (like taking their hands off the steering wheel) that could jeopardize not only their own safety but the safety of people around them.&lt;/strong&gt; Coalescing around standard terminology will not just prevent misunderstanding and confusion, it will also save lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WiMlKr"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17960456/self-driving-cars-av-safety-common-language-rand"&gt;increasingly urgent calls&lt;/a&gt; to standardize the language used to describe autonomous driving. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/avs-need-common-language-to-tell-us-what-theyre-doing-3bd1ea4f-bf9f-4d35-8ef9-5c286fe6198a.html"&gt;Ford recently came out in favor&lt;/a&gt; of standardized visual cues that autonomous vehicles could use to communicate intent to pedestrians, bicyclists, and other drivers. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="http://www.thedrive.com/opinion/20495/how-the-language-of-self-driving-is-killing-us"&gt;critics continue to assail&lt;/a&gt; the five levels of automation as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers, the global standard for self-driving, for being overly broad and possibly dangerous. Most experts agree: we need a better, more unified way to talk about self-driving cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXe4sD"&gt;Tesla, in particular, is seen by most experts as abusing the lack of a common language around autonomous vehicles to overhype its products. Musk recently called Waymo’s approach to autonomous driving “impressive, but a highly specialized solution.” But there is a widening gap between what Tesla claims its vehicles can do and how they actually behave. Musk claimed Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” driver assist feature was capable of “zero intervention drives,” but within hours of the release, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKlpCG367AE&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;ab_channel=BrandonM"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kimpaquette/status/1321077451951349760"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt; of Tesla customers swerving to avoid parked cars and other near misses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8a93y"&gt;Years ago, Waymo considered developing an advanced driver-assist system like Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” version of Autopilot but ultimately decided against it, having become “alarmed” by the negative effects on the driver. Drivers would zone out or fall asleep at the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3R7Bf"&gt;The experiment in driver assistance helped solidify Waymo’s mission: fully autonomous or bust. To that end, Waymo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently began offering rides in its fully driverless vehicles to the general public&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How much you love The Office may determine what Peacock plan you get, apparently</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XD3AeeKz1tesHtAWdQ1nLPajXZU=/0x4:620x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628272/office_computer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NBC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPhEj0"&gt;Chances are if you’re looking into signing up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324215/peacock-nbc-universal-comcast-app-how-to-watch-download-price-subscription-stream-shows"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; (“Ugh, another streaming service!”), it’s because you’re trying to watch &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;— and NBC knows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pfqWte"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;isn’t just a big deal to college students who are just getting into Jim and Pam’s “will they, won’t they” relationship; it’s a massive play for subscribers from NBCUniversal. And now, the streamer’s marketing attempts reflect that importance. Instead of simply saying “this plan will give you access to these types of titles,” Peacock’s pricing is broken down by just how much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174856/the-office-netflix-peacock-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;you personally love The Office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uCAiJp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Peacock is literally pricing their service based on how much of the Office you can watch what is going on &lt;a href="https://t.co/mTHX0GYXSh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mTHX0GYXSh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— cowabummer (@ItsRetroNemo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ItsRetroNemo/status/1346565557848580096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLraaN"&gt;Just want the first two seasons? The free plan will be more than enough. Looking for every episode of &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, along with never-before-seen clips? You’ll want Peacock Premium. Want everything in that tier but without all of those pesky ads (more on that in a second)? Peacock Premium Plus is what you’re looking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Za4x7x"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="046MPZ"&gt;Beyond the confusion associated with each tier, trying to sell people a service based on how much&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;they love &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;seems... well, not great. Especially when people start signing up for Peacock and are left frustrated. For example: Peacock Premium Plus isn’t exactly ad-free. Even though NBCUniversal notes that in a disclaimer on the signup page, the Peacock subreddit is &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/peacock/comments/j3kms1/paying_for_adfree_to_still_see_ads/"&gt;full of annoyed customers&lt;/a&gt; who believed the entire experience would be ad-free, only to discover that “a small amount of programming will still contain ads.” As tech reporter and columnist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/waltmossberg/status/1345096947821146116"&gt;Walt Mossberg tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, the move from Netflix to Peacock has “diminished the experience of viewing the show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZK0sR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt; was previously available on Netflix, where it remained one of the most watched shows on any streaming service for several years. Unlike Peacock, Netflix is also extremely easy to use. People pay on average about $14 a month, and they get access to everything without ads on almost any device they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7Dg4x"&gt;Peacock isn’t the only streamer whose “ad-free” platform contains ads. Hulu’s ad-free plan will run ads on “a select number of shows from our streaming library” due to streaming rights, &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/no-ads-exceptions?language=en_US"&gt;according to the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, there are two shows that contain ads: &lt;em&gt;Grey’s Anatomy &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;. Comparatively, it seems like there are more ads that play on shows and films on Peacock’s “ad-free” tier. NBC likely has a similar contractual obligation to show ads on some shows, but there’s no warning icon or sign to indicate what programming will have an ad until one pops up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0lx4jm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s bad to make paid customers feel like they’re not getting what you promised them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTqc35"&gt;We’re in a transitional moment for the industry. There’s never been more to stream, but it’s also more fragmented than ever (at least in the United States), as every conglomerate tries to find its place in a booming marketplace. Everything used to be on Netflix or Hulu. Now, everything is somewhere, but it’s left to customers to figure out where exactly their favorite show or movie is and if it’s really worth adding another $10 subscription to their monthly expenses. In other words: is &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Friends &lt;/em&gt;really worth buying a Peacock or HBO Max subscription? That’s something individual customers have to decide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHuZQ0"&gt;It’s important to note that the entirety of &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Ftv-season%2Fthe-office-the-complete-series%2Fid1438674900&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22216867%2Fpeacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $70 on iTunes right now&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re only signing up for Peacock to watch &lt;em&gt;The Office&lt;/em&gt;, there are better ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foyV9d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 7 is still running on at least 100 million PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xfDSHMyZkGjlwDmiug-DL5JlReY=/7x0:1014x671/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68628125/win7.0.1436517999.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PO3Zpo"&gt;Windows 7 appears to still be running on at least 100 million machines, despite Microsoft ending support for the operating system a year ago. &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-7-a-year-after-the-end-of-support-deadline-millions-choose-not-to-upgrade/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet &lt;/em&gt;has been analyzing&lt;/a&gt; the proportion of PCs still running Windows 7 across various analytics reports. While each data source pegs Windows 7 at different percentages of market share, most agree that the OS still makes up for around 20 percent of PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BupxI"&gt;Microsoft has said for years that there are 1.5 billion users of Windows across multiple versions worldwide. It’s difficult to get an exact number of Windows 7 users owing to the different methods used by analytics companies, but it’s at least 100 million. If you drop Microsoft’s estimate of 1.5 billion users of Windows to just a billion (there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21116762/microsoft-windows-10-active-devices-billion-7-support"&gt;1 billion active Windows 10 users&lt;/a&gt;), then Windows 7 is still on a massive amount of PCs. In reality, it could still be in use by more than 200 million devices worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Dell XPS 13 (late 2020)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DlGu9NcyOGiBmZH9uk0wUADgPx0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22007661/mchin_190124_4274_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s XPS 13 is a popular Windows 10 machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7SBhsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065122/microsoft-windows-7-end-of-support-lifecycle-millions-pcs"&gt;Support for Windows 7 ended in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 11 years after the OS first launched with its “I’m a PC, and Windows 7 was my idea” marketing campaign. It quickly became a massively popular version of Windows, especially with businesses. It was clear from looking at the market share of the operating system last year that it would take a year or two to get Windows 7 firmly below 10 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyN99B"&gt;It may take even longer for Windows 7 to finally disappear, especially after a year when many have turned to PCs for remote working and home schooling. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241681/microsoft-q3-2020-earnings-surface-windows-xbox-revenue-profit"&gt;Microsoft reported an increase in PC demand&lt;/a&gt; and usage due to the pandemic. It’s likely that part of that PC usage also came from households dusting off old PCs and laptops they haven’t used frequently, and some of these devices could still be running Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtoWZb"&gt;It’s clear that the pandemic has also influenced the PC market over the past year. We’re still waiting on PC estimates from Gartner and IDC, but some analysts believe we could have seen nearly 300 million PCs shipped in 2020 alone. That would be a significant change for the PC market, after PCs saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065100/pc-market-shipments-idc-gartner-growth-2019-laptops-desktops-windows-7-10"&gt;first year of growth&lt;/a&gt; since 2011 during 2019. That growth was boosted by the end of Windows 7 support, and most analysts didn’t expect the market to grow even further throughout 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
