        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wireless earbuds make a great holiday gift for others or yourself.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLBEwG"&gt;One of the most sought-after gifts every holiday — at least, ever since Apple removed the 3.5mm headphone jack from the iPhone — has been true wireless earbuds. They are often the favored listening device of many people because they offer the most convenience, and they’re a product category that frequently goes on sale. Full-size headphones offer superior sound, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22796131/black-friday-headphones-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;those have their fair share&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday discounts&lt;/a&gt; to be had, but most casual listeners often prefer earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2rBqw"&gt;Here, we have rounded up all the best early Black Friday deals we can find on wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Jabra, Beats, and even Google, as well as a couple of lesser-known brands. Each has its own unique qualities or value proposition to offer, and we have deals spanning the range that can fit into any budget — starting with premium models and extending all the way to entry-level options still worth your listening time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sukfZy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"},{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="2ugPuK"&gt;The best deals on premium earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ev2IcG"&gt;The Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds have been &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;pick for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;the best overall earbuds&lt;/a&gt; since they took the market by storm over the summer. These earbuds are currently on sale for $248, as opposed to their list price of $280, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3rGTOkfpF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-earbuds-wf-1000xm4%2F-%2FA-83706422%3Fpreselect%3D82691015%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Leading-Noise-Canceling-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-Black%2F846848972&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1645715-REG%2Fsony_wf1000xm4_b_wireless_noise_canceling.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JDX844"&gt;Jabra’s Elite 85t offer noise cancellation and the ability to connect to multiple devices, all for the very competitive price of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, discounted from their usual $230. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bGl5Kz"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds really stand out for their noise-canceling chops, and for Black Friday, they are on sale nearly everywhere for $199, down from their full price of $280.

These buds trade noise cancellation for better IPX4 sweat and weather resistance, with blue and white options for sporty colors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aEHu7v"&gt;The latest revision of Apple’s hugely popular AirPods Pro now comes with a MagSafe-compatible charging case, and you can currently get it for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-Pro%2F975690481%3Fathbdg%3DL2000&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$159 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to its normal full price of $249 (saving you $90). &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3urgh0XZ0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-84852592%3Fpreselect%3D77603773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also have it marked down but only to $190. The AirPods Pro are always a hot seller during Black Friday and Cyber Monday times, so we might see more movement here with other retailers joining the competitive fray. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="u5G8Uj"&gt;Samsung’s top-line Galaxy Buds Pro are a strong alternative to some of Apple’s best and, most likely, your ideal solution if you prefer Galaxy phones.

&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yBZHUa"&gt;The second-gen Apple AirPods with a wired charging case are practically the de facto standard in the world of wireless earbuds. They don’t have active noise-canceling, but the hard plastic design allows a one-size-fits-many approach, and the connectivity to Apple devices is easy as pie. They’re on sale for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$109 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $50.

&lt;li id="peFXtu"&gt;The newest earbuds from Apple, the third-gen AirPods, borrow some styling from the AirPods Pro and improve on the second-gen while adding a MagSafe case. So far, we have seen them temporarily drop to $155 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; but quickly sell out.

&lt;li id="ff9S6b"&gt;The bean-like Galaxy Buds Live have a unique design that is very low-key when you’re wearing them out, and the sound quality is great for something so compact — even if the noise-canceling isn’t the best.

&lt;li id="O7U3xo"&gt;The recently launched OnePlus Buds Pro are affordable earbuds that nail a lot of the basics for a great price. They’re currently just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Wireless-Charging-Cancellation-E503A/dp/B07XWK1DYB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$120 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off the full price of $150. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637548/oneplus-buds-pro-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="bU3yW4"&gt;The Google Pixel Buds A-series are a lower-cost option of the Pixel Buds that finally started to get wireless earbuds right for Google, and being cheaper helps this model to be even more appealing. It’s a solid earbud for any Android user, but maybe most desirable if you’re a Pixel phone owner. You can pick them up for just $79 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3vBW7Etnr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Pixel-Buds-A-Series-Truly-Wireless-Earbuds-Audio-Headphones-with-Bluetooth-White%2F620970985&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1635922-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02213_us_pixel_buds_a_series_true.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22792011%2Fblack-friday-wireless-earbuds-deals-2021-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465651/google-pixel-buds-a-series-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWqOnU"&gt;The Anker Soundcore Liberty Air 2 are not going to win any notable awards in any particular categories, but they’re fine for a basic set of earbuds from a reputable brand that just cost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soundcore-Bluetooth-Earphones-Personalized-Cancelling/dp/B07SKJNCXM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$45 ($5 off) at&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for Black Friday. They even have wireless charging and solid battery life. Think of it as stepping into stocking stuffer territory, but you’re not buying the equivalent of a true wireless lump of coal.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>What not to do when your podcast app gets acquired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1TZbaLf2gIz6tK087Q6DrxTTQ6Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70182144/acast_radiopublic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acast&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QkhRTr"&gt;Hello, hello. Welcome back to Tuesday; I hope everyone has found ways to keep “working” ahead of the holiday and isn’t daydreaming too much about the hoards of food we here in the US will be eating in just a couple days. Today’s issue is a hodgepodge of things — a nice mix. Today, we’re talking about what happens when a podcast app gets acquired, ExxonMobil “duping” &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xw3PKd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCLUSIVE: Acast acquired RadioPublic in February; now podcasters say the company has gone dark on them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbAoZc"&gt;In February, Acast, the Europe-based hosting and monetization company, acquired RadioPublic, a podcast player and company known for its creator-centric technology. The acquisition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22289742/acast-radiopublic-podcasting-platform-acquisition"&gt;was billed to me&lt;/a&gt; as a way for Acast to take over the podcast space and become big in the US. Notably, Matt MacDonald, co-founder and chief product officer of RadioPublic, told me at the time: “We have no intention of spinning [the RadioPublic] app down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lVmgr"&gt;But now, nine months after the purchase, podcasters say the app is borked and not updating. New episodes aren’t regularly uploaded on certain show pages; some podcasters can’t publicly list new shows; and, beyond that, many say they can’t get in touch with the company despite reaching out through a dedicated support email and social media. The issue appears to have been going on for months. Lots of people have tweeted to the company, but I’ll include a couple screenshots below so you can get an idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aVl2Xpcnju13uUJ__2_-T5frvG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036301/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_1.32.48_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mx1dzuC1tipfQHX3PzJ6EKv7snA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036303/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_1.33.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-TpYRpDGhRV-_3SDO-MgMQ28XiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23036305/Screen_Shot_2021_11_22_at_1.33.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hueki7"&gt;One podcaster, Klaudia Amenábar, who hosts the queer &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; podcast &lt;a href="https://rupalps-podrace-a-queer-star-wars-podcast.simplecast.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RuPalp’s Podrace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, tells me she ran into issues when trying to distribute the show on RadioPublic. Although her RSS feed worked fine on all other listening apps, whenever she tried to make it publicly available on RadioPublic, she received an error message. This went on, she says, for months and still isn’t fixed. MacDonald emailed her directly, once she tweeted at Acast’s account, and told her the team was “unable to help individual podcasts diagnose a specific error,” according to a screenshot viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. She later tried to also distribute a second show with a separate RSS feed and received the same error. Her hosting provider, Simplecast, troubleshot her RSS feed to ensure nothing strange was going on, she says, and, “at the end, they were like, ‘That’s really weird, it must be a RadioPublic problem.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hYv09"&gt;I reached out to Acast for comment and got this: “We’re aware of an issue that currently appears to affect a small number of feeds on the RadioPublic platform, impacting the submission and display of new content. We understand this is frustrating for the creators affected and for fans trying to access new content from the affected feeds. Our team is investigating the cause and is working to get this resolved as soon as possible. We will share an update with the community once we have more information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaF849"&gt;Now, RadioPublic isn’t a top app or even remotely essential to podcasters’ distribution strategy. (Dave Zohrob, CEO at Chartable, tells me over the past 30 days, it accounted for less than 0.1 percent of listens, as did Justin Jackson, co-founder of Transistor.fm, from March data, which, yeah, not great, but also not helped by the fact that at least some shows can’t get their episodes to update.) But the reason I bring this story up is because of the many acquisitions we’ve seen in this space and to use this as an example of how not to handle it, particularly if you interface with podcasters directly. Don’t leave them in the lurch. Another podcaster I spoke with, David Cameo, the founder and host of &lt;a href="https://squawkingdead.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Squawking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; podcast, tells me he had embedded the RadioPublic player on his website for four years until the company went silent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qB1Ra"&gt;“I just gave up on them. Had to. Nobody cares.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8ofTV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s ExxonMobil ad and the struggle to get podcast ads right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57n99Q"&gt;A conversation is brewing around how oil companies are using podcast ads to advance their messaging and brand. Emily Atkin over at the &lt;em&gt;Heated&lt;/em&gt; newsletter &lt;a href="https://heated.world/p/how-exxon-duped-the-daily"&gt;wrote last week&lt;/a&gt; about an ExxonMobil ad that ran in &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;that she says is misleading. (Check out Atkin’s post for the specifics of the ad and her proposed edits.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hky43d"&gt;She writes that the ad “appeared to violate &lt;em&gt;The Daily&lt;/em&gt;’s policy against fossil fuel sponsorships.” However, a&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;spokesperson told her: “We do not allow oil and gas companies to sponsor &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;wholesale,” but “[any] company can place spot advertising within &lt;em&gt;The Daily &lt;/em&gt;podcast, as long as it meets our advertising acceptability guidelines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7d7OJ"&gt;Also worth adding to the story here is &lt;em&gt;Drilled&lt;/em&gt; podcast host Amy Westervelt’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amywestervelt/status/1458841818313859077?s=20"&gt;thread&lt;/a&gt; on other oil companies and oil-reliant brands utilizing podcast ads. One person notes Politico’s&lt;em&gt; Energy &lt;/em&gt;podcast is sponsored by Chevron, which indeed appears to be true, just as another example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vc3bF3"&gt;Still, this line between sponsorships and spot advertising is definitely an odd one for the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; to draw, and I won’t pretend to understand it. But I did reach out to a few folks on the ad side of things to figure out how the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ fact-checking process usually goes and whether this ad rang alarm bells for them. One ad buyer told me they’ve had the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; push back on ad copy and request data or research to support what’s being said. They also said claims aren’t allowed to be made; neither are endorsements. Others didn’t seem shocked by what was being said in this particular ad. One person equated Exxon’s “clever wording” to how tech companies often market their products — hyping a new feature — but doubted the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ listeners would be duped into thinking Exxon has nothing to do with oil so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="I9cbiA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27NcqO"&gt;Broadly, I imagine this is only the start of broader pushback on misleading ads, as well as strange brand / content pair-ups, both from the public and podcast hosts. This might happen for a few reasons: 1.) As more indie shows go corporate, they cede control over their advertisers to bigger and hungrier sales teams. 2.) As more money enters the space, of which I will have much more to say in the coming weeks, larger advertisers are flooding in, often those who run more controversial businesses. 3.) Dynamic Ad Insertion becoming more popular means more shows are allowing ad marketplaces to automatically insert ads based on audience targeting. This might yield undesired pairings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q7m2lp"&gt;All of which is to say, I’m keeping a close eye on how this nets out. We’ve come to expect some bizarre display ads to show up alongside the articles we read online. We probably even feel the same way about radio ads. Will that expectation of shitty ads come to podcasts, too? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie1SUO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confused podcast listeners helpfully review bomb Apple Podcasts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ELxwI"&gt;You might recall people pointing out months ago that Apple Podcasts maintained an abysmally low app rating. People hate it, I guess. So imagine the shock and awe when positive reviews started pouring in, raising its rating from 1.8 stars to 4.6. The catch, however, is that these reviews all extoll various podcasts, not the app itself. My colleague Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791968/apple-podcasts-star-score-review-prompt"&gt;has the full story&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple confirmed that it’s relying on a new review prompt. “With iOS 15.1 released last month, Apple Podcasts began prompting listeners to leave a rating and review just like most third-party apps — using the standard Rating &amp;amp; Review prompt available to all developers,” said an Apple spokesperson. People are just confused about what they’re supposed to be reviewing. The power of an in-app push!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkAZk8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook is paying people up to $50K to get them to use its live audio feature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUuUro"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-hands-out-cash-to-creators-to-boost-clubhouse-rival"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; (from behind a paywall) that Facebook is resorting to cash to get creators to use its Live Audio Rooms feature. Per the piece: “Facebook is offering to pay musicians and other creators $10,000 to $50,000 per session on its five-month-old live audio product, plus a fee for guests of $10,000 or more,” according to “people with direct knowledge of deal terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYInXm"&gt;At that price, hosts have to put together four to six live programs lasting at least 30 minutes each. I will be shocked if anyone tunes into these rooms, honestly, but I can’t fault people for wanting to get the $$$. However, what I don’t fully understand about these tech companies spending millions to get people to try their new feature is whether any of these users will actually stick around when the cash runs out. An open question at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnbfrL"&gt;Now, finally, one for the Goners in the room:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez5UUo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Long Gone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;podcast is releasing an album of music commentary?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4mgPZ"&gt;I hate to admit that I’ve become a Goner, but it happened. For our purposes, though, &lt;em&gt;How Long Gone&lt;/em&gt;, an interview and culture show co-hosted by Chris Black and Jason Stewart, signed to record label Jagjaguwar to release &lt;a href="https://www.secretlystore.com/how-long-gone"&gt;an album&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/donetodeath/status/1461705143909552129?s=20"&gt;now has&lt;/a&gt; a tracklist and details. Coming out December 17th, apparently the duo recorded an 80-minute commentary about music from various Jagjaguwar artists. Two CDs for $13.99. Props for the creative monetization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8maThR"&gt;Okay, that’s it. A long one, but I have to make up for future lost time. I’ll catch you all next Tuesday. Ta-ta.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals under $25</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/InnS7S5uPiCAjrbGIvGg1i-jofo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181956/dseifert_181011_3006_1141.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the best affordable smart speakers you can get is just $20 today.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ld9a3y"&gt;If our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;best early Black Friday deals under $50&lt;/a&gt; was outside your budget, don’t worry: there’s also plenty you can buy for under $25. Several retailers are now heavily discounting popular tech products in the short lead-up to Black Friday, discounting everything from Bluetooth trackers and smart speakers to the latest gaming subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Va5kw"&gt;For your convenience, we’ve curated a list of some of the best sub-$25 options below. If you’re looking for more holiday gift ideas that won’t break the bank, however, we’ve also put together separate budget-based gift guides for items under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745314/holiday-gift-guide-under-25-cheap-tech-2021-best-ideas"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"&gt;$50&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UG2Xy7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;For iPhone owners planning on traveling this holiday season, Amazon’s offering a great deal on Apple’s official AirTag Loop. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own, you’ll need such a loop to securely attach them to luggage, keys, and other items. Unfortunately, these loops can be as expensive as the AirTags themselves. Thankfully, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirTag-Loop-Deep-Navy/dp/B0932LZM6K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting the loop made to carry Apple’s popular Bluetooth tracker, selling it an all-time low of around $20 instead of $29. This deal is valid on the deep navy colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XnECMp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zOcQkL"&gt;Like Apple’s AirTag, Samsung Galaxy SmartTag Plus locates lost items ranging from keys to pets. Even though it can work with both iOS and Android devices, we recommend it more for Samsung users as it’s designed to work best with Samsung Galaxy devices. The convenient Bluetooth tracker features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio so you can more accurately track items and use the AR mode to see exactly where your missing tag is. To use the UWB radio, though, you’ll need a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone. The tracker can also be used as a remote control for Samsung smart home stuff. It’s a great buy for those embedded within the Samsung ecosystem, especially right now, as the tracker is going for $25 instead of $40 today at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-SmartTag-Bluetooth-Tracker-Locator/dp/B08NRNSVRK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/client_redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fmobile%2Fmobile-accessories%2Fphones%2Fgalaxy-a-smart-tag-1-pack-black-ei-t7300bbegus%2F%3Fnrtv_cid%3D.nrtv_plchldr.%26cid%3Dopmc-ecomm-nrtiv-mobacc-042720-142010-verge-8259575%26utm_source%3Dverge%26utm_medium%3Dnarrativ%26utm_campaign%3D8259575%26utm_content%3Dmobacc%26nrtv_as_src%3D1&amp;amp;a=1745743455626377571&amp;amp;uuid=b35751ff-a0af-4e83-9776-063d4c38d134&amp;amp;uid_bam=1750571413629784227&amp;amp;ar=1758359825979119625" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PULPjx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPzUR"&gt;For Xbox owners, we found a phenomenal deal from &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-xbox-one-digital/-/A-76626995&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeDealRoundup11222021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22560195%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate pass for $25 instead of its usual $45 — which is nearly 50 percent off. This pass gives Xbox owners access to online multiplayer and exclusive deals, as well as EA Play tiles and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud. It also offers access to more than 100 Xbox titles for a flat, monthly fee, including &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22637945/halo-infinite-release-date-launch"&gt;launches next month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cBwzN1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k5hzbg"&gt;It may be an older model, but the third-generation Echo Dot is still a great device that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;we once called&lt;/a&gt; the best cheap smart speaker you can buy. It’s far superior to its predecessor, with a loud and rich sound we praised. Right now, you can pick one up with a free Sengled smart bulb from Amazon for just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-3rd-Gen-Bluetooth/dp/B08YT3BWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $35 on an otherwise $55 bundle. If you don’t want the color bulb, you can also opt for six months free of Amazon Music Unlimited instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7nnaNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vLMzzl"&gt;For those who prefer Google smart speakers, the Google Nest Mini is currently 50 percent off at multiple retailers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called the small smart speaker a great upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini, one that sounds far better. The Nest Mini also makes it easy to add Google Assistant to your home. It lacks the Echo Dot’s 3.5mm jack that allows for a wired connection, but, unlike Amazon’s device, you can hang it on your wall without extra accessories. Right now, you can pick one up in various colors for 50 percent off at &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/google_nest_mini?hl=en-US"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Google-Nest-Mini-2nd-Generation-Charcoal/741412707?athbdg=L1300&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1LKg5XqS2?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fblack-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/google-nest-mini-2nd-generation/-/A-78589456?preselect=76500134#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=GoogleBF2021&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22552072%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which are all selling the speaker for $25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="opekZV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="7cYUPB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDsK5U"&gt;Streaming sticks are also heavily discounted right now, especially over on Amazon. At the moment, Amazon is even taking 50 percent off of the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XVYZ1Y5?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=124&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbea42d-e732-8263-21f&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22553294%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;older Fire TV Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with the third-gen Alexa remote. Typically $50, you can pick one up right now for $25, the device’s best price to date. It may not be as capable as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; (which is currently selling for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=94&amp;amp;imprToken=1abea435-1abd-7fcc-e1c&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22548186%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/black-friday%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35&lt;/a&gt; instead of $55), but it’s still plenty fast and supports Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, HDR10 Plus, and HDR10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Obk1C9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Bg1h"&gt;Those curious about Google’s Stadia game streaming service may want to check out this Stadia Premiere Edition bundle discount, which is available for more than 70 percent off. The $80 bundle comes with a white Stadia controller, as well as a 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for just $22&lt;/a&gt;, which equates to around $58 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqIGMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10880420"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="xJLatZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Stadia is celebrating its second birthday with hardware for free or cheap","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XXTH4I"&gt;The Blink Mini is a small, wired home security camera that comes with night vision and is capable of recording in 1080p while supporting two-way audio. While we weren’t blown away by the camera, we found that it still offers good video and audio quality for its price. Typically $35, you can buy the already affordable camera for $20 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Mini-plug-security-detection/dp/B07X6C9RMF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Note, however, those new to Blink’s ecosystem will have to pay an additional $3 per camera each month for cloud storage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21231112/blink-mini-smart-home-camera-security-cam-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="kNXToM"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are other great deals under $25:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="T1RmFO"&gt;PlayStation 4 owners can pick up Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy &lt;/em&gt;alongside a SteelBook for &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMarvel-s-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-Square-Enix-with-Walmart-Exclusive-SteelBook-PlayStation-4%2F765263786" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25&lt;/a&gt;, a $35 discount on its typical $60 price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747428/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-ps5-square-enix" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Black Friday 2021 smart home tech deals: speakers, cameras, robots, and more </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZzBxpdIVD7rM7z674DaQ5xUPd_E=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70178330/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 8 is one of many smart speakers and displays on sale this smart home buying season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uNHMij"&gt;There is never a better time to dive into the smart home than Black Friday and its close cousin Cyber Monday. Traditionally, tech deals on home gadgets are huge this time of year, plus, it’s the only time you’ll find real bargains on gear from some of the smaller companies, such as Eve, Level, and Nanoleaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjy6kh"&gt;Whether you’re thinking about dipping a toe into this home automation shindig with a smart speaker or maybe a connected door lock, or want to bolster an already impressive smart home setup, it’s worth investing some cash this holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRU2qz"&gt;Also, if you just want to upgrade your home cleaning routine or have a way to check in on Fido now that you’re back at work (the separation anxiety is real), this is a good time to get a great bargain on smart cameras, robot vacuums, and even a smart mop. Here’s our roundup of the best deals on smart home gear you can buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQmoq2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for more Black Friday deals? Be sure to check out our continuously updated roundup of all the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;&lt;em&gt;best early Black Friday sales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eero’s mesh Wi-Fi products are 40 percent off right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lKgkN0"&gt;Mesh Wi-Fi router deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KckJmY"&gt;The foundation of any smart home is good Wi-Fi, and if you’re looking to start out or are having trouble with connections in your home, a mesh Wi-Fi router is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="alHazy"&gt;For a battery-powered option, the new Blink video doorbell is just $34.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a savings of $10, and it can also be wired if you prefer.&lt;/li&gt;

You’ll want to make sure you can mount this on the side of your house first, as it has a rather awkward under-the-eave install. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776184/google-nest-cam-floodlight-review-smart-security-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read our review of this floodlight camera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="3qtfvz"&gt;If you’ve steered clear of robot vacuums because you don’t want to tidy up every time you run one (the cable clutter struggle is real) or empty the tiny bin — ever — Samsung’s Jet Bot AI Plus with Self Empty Clean Station is now $999.99, down from $1,299. Its AI does a good job of avoiding anything you place in its path and you can grab this deal at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf3sdfPvz6B" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung.co&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://Samung.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;m&lt;/a&gt; through December 1st.&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $499 Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 and $579 AMD Radeon RX 6800 are still selling well above MSRP.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KzoG02"&gt;Sony, Microsoft, Nvidia and AMD say they’re doing everything in their power to put a console or graphics card in your hands. But judging by eBay resale prices, their best won’t be nearly good enough this holiday season. One year after the next generation of gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430284/microsoft-sony-xbox-series-ps5-nvidia-rtx-3080-next-gen-gaming"&gt;was supposed to arrive&lt;/a&gt; (narrator: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791886/ps5-xbox-series-x-next-gen-consoles-games-delays-supply-shorage"&gt;it did not&lt;/a&gt;) people are &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; forking out hundreds of dollars over MSRP for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, and and they’re often still paying &lt;em&gt;double&lt;/em&gt; what a new PC graphics card was originally supposed to cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpa6YI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;Remember March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when I told you how the two graphics cards in the photo above were worth a combined $2,570 on the open market? That was a shocking leap compared to the $1,660 total they could fetch in December 2020, already well above their $1,078 MSRP. But eight months later, that same photo now contains $2,605 worth of GPUs on the secondhand market. They haven’t dipped one bit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhRcke"&gt;The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, too, are fetching higher prices this week than they did in March 2020 — if you take the scalper route, you can expect to pay over $800 on average for what should have been a $500 game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kH7OBR"&gt;Those are the key findings from our latest dive into eBay sales data, but here’s the whole set for you to scan yourself. It includes the latest street prices for every console and graphics card released this generation, after filtering out a number of fakes, bundles, freak outliers (one AMD RX 6800 allegedly sold for $8,260) and other eBay listings that muddied the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VGnQKj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10882070"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hrLEwD"&gt;As you can see from the chart, a PS5 is no longer worth $1,000 like it was back in December 2020, but the discless PS5 Digital Edition can still fetch twice its asking price on eBay, and even the Xbox Series X appears to be slightly more desirable than before. The one bright spot is the less expensive Xbox Series S, which has finally come down to a mere $50 or so over its original list price of $300.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wt02nF"&gt;There are a few surprising findings on the GPU side of things, like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"&gt;RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; is currently fetching more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524897/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;3070 Ti&lt;/a&gt;, despite being a little less powerful for games. (Perhaps people prefer the 3070’s reduced power consumption, smaller frame, and — in some cases — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;lack of cryptocurrency mining nerfs&lt;/a&gt;.) It’s also remarkable how much less the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"&gt;3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt; fetches now, despite being fairly close to a 3070 in performance and well regarded for both gaming and mining from what I’ve heard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCvngA"&gt;Then again, the 3060 Ti Founders Edition is in greater demand than ever — the $400 card is now pulling down $1,447 on average, though I didn’t break it out in the chart. It’s one of the best picks out there for smaller cases, so I’m not wholly surprised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc8sFy"&gt;Raw street prices don’t tell the whole story, though. Like in March, I also compiled a chart of &lt;em&gt;how many&lt;/em&gt; consoles and components changed hands on eBay this past week, and it’s intriguing: Less than half as many Sony PS5s are moving, but now almost twice as many Nvidia graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3jkLbe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10882103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzcmm6"&gt;Lower secondhand sales numbers for consoles don’t necessarily mean weaker supply — in fact, it could easily mean the opposite. Perhaps more people are getting satisfaction outside of eBay, never needing a scalper, because the likes of Sony and Microsoft are letting more people buy those consoles at retail instead. But on the GPU side of things, we can also still see how precious few AMD graphics cards are changing hands compared to Nvidia, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;original excellent Radeon RX 6800&lt;/a&gt; barely a blip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV9Q5b"&gt;Unfortunately, there's no end in sight for the great GPU shortage, so you shouldn’t expect prices to settle down anytime soon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;Both Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;AMD expect&lt;/a&gt; it to linger for most of 2022, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;Intel suggested last month&lt;/a&gt; that it likely won’t be resolved until 2023. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;The chip shortage is a complicated problem,&lt;/a&gt; and it takes time to spin up additional factories to satisfy demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTWhqz"&gt;Over the past year, using a very particular set of skills I have acquired over a long career as a dealhunter, I managed to snap up a $499 PS5 and a $399 Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti Founder’s Edition at MSRP. They’re worth roughly $2,317 today, not that I plan to sell. Here’s hoping next check-in, those prices will have gone way down.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Qualcomm exclusivity deal for Windows on Arm reportedly ending soon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YBI5pg2qxhJd28XoiXRsVuekG0o=/0x3:2239x1496/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181604/Windows_10_ARM_Microsoft_Qualcomm.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fXIRW"&gt;Qualcomm reportedly has an exclusivity deal with Microsoft for Windows on Arm licenses. The pair launched Windows on Arm laptops in 2016, and so far we haven’t seen any devices launch without a Qualcomm chip. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/qualcomm-exclusivity-deal-microsoft-windows-on-arm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm has had an exclusivity deal on Windows on Arm, but that it’s set to expire soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFA1FO"&gt;The report comes days after MediaTek held its executive summit with members of the media last week, where it shared its ambitions to build its own chip for Windows on Arm PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlACLx"&gt;If Microsoft’s exclusivity deal is about to end with Qualcomm, this could open the door for many more vendors supporting Windows on Arm. Samsung, MediaTek, and even Apple’s M1 chips could eventually support Windows on Arm. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Osx2JGpWq-JuqaS_bxzHkKo8OPw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19250204/akrales_190930_3682_0006_right.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s custom SQ1 Qualcomm chip for the Surface Pro X (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgXxix"&gt;While you can run Windows on Apple’s M1 Macs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383598/parallels-desktop-mac-windows-10-install-m1-macbook"&gt;through Parallels Desktop&lt;/a&gt; virtual machine software, Apple does not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;support Boot Camp on M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft only licenses the Arm version of Windows to PC makers. Whether or not Microsoft would license Windows on Arm to Apple, or Apple would support such a scenario remains to be seen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bLUuk5"&gt;Microsoft has also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;working on designing its own Arm-based processors&lt;/a&gt; for servers and possibly future Surface devices. The software giant started work on these new chips more than a year ago, and reports suggest they’ll be used primarily in servers for Microsoft’s Azure cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dER52U"&gt;Microsoft currently uses Intel-based processors for the majority of its Azure cloud services, and most of the company’s Surface lineup runs on Intel chips. Microsoft did break from tradition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20888999/microsoft-surface-pro-x-laptop-3-custom-processor-qualcomm-amd-specs"&gt;work with AMD and Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; for custom chips for its Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X devices. There are &lt;a href="https://www.clien.net/service/board/park/16536544"&gt;even rumors&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is also working with AMD on Arm-based laptop processors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung set to announce new $17 billion advanced chip plant in Texas: report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBUCPU5l1Q0c3l15iyH4zLxXNW4=/0x0:694x463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181590/main_visual1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung already has a presence in Austin, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ll0b4Z"&gt;Samsung is expected to officially announce a new advanced chip-making plant in Texas later today, that’s estimated to cost around $17 billion and could create 1,800 jobs, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-to-choose-taylor-texas-for-17-billion-chipmaking-factory-11637627613"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The new plant will reportedly be located in the city of Taylor, roughly 30 miles away from Austin, where Samsung has an existing facility. The new site is roughly 1,200 acres in size, making it larger than Samsung’s Austin plant, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZCnLJ"&gt;The announcement could come as soon as 5pm local time today, when Gov. Greg Abbott is due to make an “economic announcement.” However, the plant isn’t expected to actually start producing chips until the end of 2024, according to previous filings. Eventually, Samsung is expected to begin using the new plant to produce processors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226849/samsung-exynos-2100-chip-processor-galaxy-s21-international"&gt;for its own uses&lt;/a&gt; and for use in other companies’ products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umagtU"&gt;The city of Taylor specifically has also offered Samsung incentives to locate its plant there, which reportedly amount to property tax breaks of over 90 percent for its first ten years, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UvNy1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company has declined to comment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gIR3sT"&gt;Samsung is a giant in the memory chip manufacturing game, but it’ll likely use the Taylor plant to manufacture advanced chips for other companies based on their designs. Previous reports have indicated this new plant could produce chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243994/samsung-chipmaking-texas-plant-3nm-10-billion-report"&gt;as advanced as 3nm&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung has previously produced chips for companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RizEjX"&gt;The company declined to comment to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; on its report, noting only that “a final decision has not yet been made regarding the location.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nT1t5"&gt;The expansion comes as the global semiconductor shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;continues to cause major problems&lt;/a&gt; for everyone from console makes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;car manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a situation that’s unlikely to abate until at least 2023, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;recent comments from Intel CEO&lt;/a&gt; Pat Gelsinger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDt1nd"&gt;In response, the Biden administration is attempting to bolster US chip production, reducing the potential for supply chain disruption and reversing the country’s declining share of manufacturing in recent decades. The Senate recently approved $52 billion in subsidies for new chipmaking plants, though the CHIPS Act is yet to pass in the House of Representatives, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-23/samsung-is-said-to-pick-texas-site-for-advanced-u-s-chip-plant?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmx8s"&gt;The chip-making industry has production capacity increases planned, but many of the new plants won’t be online anytime soon. TSMC and Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772167/tsmc-sony-semiconductor-fab-factory-japan-2024-7-billion"&gt;new $7 billion chip factory in Japan&lt;/a&gt; won’t see production start until the end of 2024, the same year as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;TSMC’s new $12 billion Arizona plant&lt;/a&gt;. TSMC has said it plans to invest over $100 billion in new chip factories over the next three years, while Intel plans to spend a similar amount over the next decade on investments in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new emoji are now available in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4e-dOymptyXTzqc4j12rDzUhdy0=/0x0:1600x1067/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70181570/WindowsBlog_EmojiHero_1600x1067.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji for Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VpVMne"&gt;Microsoft is making its Fluent-style emoji available in Windows 11 this week. A new optional update for the OS &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/11/22/express-yourself-with-new-emoji-now-available-in-windows-11/"&gt;is rolling out&lt;/a&gt; that includes a number of important bug fixes and the new emoji &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578352/microsoft-new-3d-emoji-clippy-windows-office"&gt;Microsoft previewed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s a totally new style, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727850/microsoft-windows-11-new-emoji-not-3d"&gt;it’s not the 3D look&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft previously promised — the company opted for 2D instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiNdIS"&gt;The new emoji in Windows 11 includes the return of Clippy, as Microsoft has replaced the standard paperclip emoji with its Clippy character. The emoji have also been redesigned to include bright and saturated colors, but lack the 3D aspects that made them pop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5qOki"&gt;“The new emoji style is only available in Windows 11 and is 2D,” explains Microsoft in a quiet update to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/emotionality-at-work-398182387adc"&gt;its design blog from July&lt;/a&gt;. “We still offer an assortment of emojis [sic] for Windows 10 customers.” This same blog post still points out that Microsoft “opted for 3D designs over 2D and chose to animate the majority of our emoji.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_uBgYKN7Ph3zXyASX2LtJ4Nv7CQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22928947/GcHxn3A.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new emoji was supposed to be more 3D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jooM9X"&gt;It’s not clear if we’ll ever see the impressive 3D emoji inside Windows 11 that Microsoft demonstrated earlier this year. The lack of 3D could be related to technical limitations of &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directwrite/color-fonts"&gt;Microsoft’s color font format&lt;/a&gt; that the company uses to display emoji inside Windows. While Apple uses bitmaps to render its emoji, Microsoft uses a vector format which is far more scalable and has file size benefits if emoji are flatter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHDlzl"&gt;We’re still expecting 3D and animated versions of these Fluent emoji to appear in products like Microsoft Teams, but if you want the new emoji in Windows then you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 11. Microsoft has made it clear that it doesn’t plan on bringing this new emoji to Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wooting Two HE review: an analog keyboard in a digital world </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The ecosystem isn’t quite ready&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Qm6zd3"&gt;Like most PC gamers, I split my time between playing using a mouse and keyboard and a console controller. Nothing beats the precision of a mouse in first- and third-person shooters, but for me, a keyboard is no match for an analog stick in racing games or platformers. They both have different strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Z5ZT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wooting_two_he"&gt;Wooting’s Two HE keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $174.99 without keycaps, is the company’s latest attempt to bridge that gap, offering some of the benefits of analog control in the form factor of a keyboard. This time around, it achieves this with Gateron-manufactured “Lekker” switches, which use magnetic Hall effect sensors rather than typical metal contacts to detect when they’ve been pressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0bG2D"&gt;It’s an interesting idea, and Wooting has more or less nailed its implementation, with a design and software that makes setting up this unusual form factor relatively painless. But in practice, I found that a lot of PC games end up getting confused by this unusual keyboard’s analog controls, which limits their usefulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84nBzj"&gt;A quick note on availability: Wooting doesn’t currently have any Two HEs available to ship immediately and lists the Wooting Two HE as being available for preorder. The next US batch is due to ship in April 2022, while in Europe, there is a small number available that’ll ship in December, with the rest expected to also ship in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lu0jam"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10880485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GDDcoO"&gt;The central feature of the Wooting Two HE is its custom Lekker switches, which are what allow it to offer analog controls. Unlike traditional Cherry MX switches, which use metal contacts to register a keypress, Wooting’s switches have small magnets in their stems and a Hall effect sensor in their circuit board that can sense when it moves. So while Cherry MX-style switches only have two states (pressed or not pressed), Wooting’s latest switches can detect gradients of a press of anywhere between 0.1mm and 4mm, aka the difference between lightly tapping a key or pushing it all the way down. This range of motion is also improved compared to the optical analog Flaretech switches used in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/1/11832654/wooting-analog-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter"&gt;Wooting One&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootingtwo"&gt;original Wooting Two&lt;/a&gt;, which could only detect between 1.5mm and 3.6mm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lLhMZc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Magnets, how do they work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGiwAX"&gt;Considering its unusual functionality, there’s nothing too unusual about the Wooting Two HE’s design. It uses a full-size layout including a numpad (currently available with US, UK, German, and Nordic layouts), features per-key RGB backlighting, and connects to a computer using a detachable USB-C cable. There are three channels for routing the cable out of the top of the keyboard, which is handy if you’d rather have it come out of the top left or top right of the board. Although the cable is nice and braided, the keyboard as a whole has a bit of a plastic feel to it that’s unbecoming of its higher-end price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2s6Jj"&gt;The Wooting Two HE starts at $174.99 without keycaps, but there are keycaps made from ABS plastic available in a bundle for $184.99 or more premium PBT keycaps for $194.99. Regardless of which you opt for, the keyboard currently doesn’t come with its keycaps preinstalled, meaning you have to manually install all 100-plus keycaps yourself. This kind of self-assembly might make sense when you’re buying your keyboard and keycaps from different places, but it feels odd when they come in the same box (Wooting tells me this won’t be the case for future US orders with PBT keycaps). I had no issues with the ABS keycaps that came with my review sample, but for just a $10 premium, I think it makes sense to step up to PBT, a plastic that generally has a reputation for being more durable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t8vpgZfTETKkUhaqwjwFwb9Ct8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006804/jporter_211111_4873_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An exposed Lekker switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H6j0j1"&gt;The Wooting Two HE’s Lekker switches are also hot-swappable, so in theory, they can be easily removed from the board using &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_extractor"&gt;IC extractors&lt;/a&gt; or other switch pullers (sold separately) and without the need for soldering. But this doesn’t matter a huge amount because, for now, at least, there aren’t any third-party compatible alternatives for you to swap in. Wooting includes four spare switches in the box with the keyboard, though, which should be helpful in case one of the switches breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZZcwx"&gt;Use the Wooting Two HE for everyday work, and it feels much like any other linear mechanical keyboard to type on. The Lekker switch’s design isn’t dissimilar to Cherry MX Reds, although weirdly, the typing sound almost reminds me of using a keyboard with Topre switches thanks to its slightly hollowed-out sound. The Cherry stabilizers do rattle, though, so be prepared to make some modifications if you’re sensitive to that sort of thing. It’s not the nicest keyboard I’ve ever typed on, but it’s functional enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KkQgxl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10880512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh2TuO"&gt;Naturally, things get a lot more interesting once you download &lt;a href="https://wooting.io/wootility"&gt;Wootility&lt;/a&gt;, Wooting’s companion software that’s available across Windows, Mac, and Linux. It’s this that lets you get the most out of the keyboard’s analog switches, which it handles alongside other more traditional keyboard companion app tasks like setting up custom lighting schemes with the keyboard’s RGB backlighting or remapping its layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3j7UV"&gt;For starters, you can reprogram their “actuation point,” which is the distance they’re pressed down before a keypress is registered. This can be set anywhere from 0.1mm to 4mm. So if you’re a heavy typist prone to accidental keypresses, you might want to set up the keyboard so you have to press a key 3.5mm before it registers a press. Or, if you want the keyboard to feel as responsive as possible, you might set the actuation point to 0.5mm, so you barely have to touch the key before it actuates. These can even be set on a per-key basis. For what it’s worth, I left the keyboard set on a middle-of-the-road 2mm actuation point, which is similar to what Cherry uses for its standard MX Red switches. I’m a basic man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNKI8vjRoQ_qdk5eebwudWeQAUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006803/jporter_211111_4873_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The per-key RGB backlighting in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R0UXbu"&gt;Another piece of functionality enabled with analog switches is the Wooting Two HE’s rapid trigger technology. Unlike a traditional switch, which only deactivates once it’s released back to a specific reset point, the Lekker switches can deactivate the second the keyboard senses you’re lifting your finger up and can reactivate the moment you’re pushing your finger back down. In theory, this should make the keyboard feel more responsive, particularly in fast-paced games, but I couldn’t discern much of a difference in everyday usage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BFKF6K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gamepad-style controls, on a keyboard&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GAaIC"&gt;The most interesting aspect of the Wooting Two HE, for me, was the possibility of remapping gamepad-style analog controls to the keyboard. Considering the slightly dizzying array of options at your disposal, Wooting’s software does a surprisingly good job at making this setup process simple and pain-free. For a first-person game, you might want to map the left analog stick’s up, left, down, and right motions to the W, A, S, and D keys, respectively. Or, for a racing game, it might make more sense to have a controller’s right and left triggers mapped to W and S while leaving the A and D keys to tilt a virtual left analog stick left and right. So long as a game supports either Xinput or DirectInput, it should work with the Wooting Two HE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf1Mvl"&gt;It’s possible to also map non-analog gamepad buttons like A, B, X, and Y to the Wooting Two HE, but in most cases, I found it less complicated to rely on regular keyboard controls for these other commands. So, for example, in &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding,&lt;/em&gt; I set WASD to emulate an analog stick but used regular keyboard controls for every other in-game action (you need to enable the “Enable Keyboards keys” toggle in Wootility for this to work). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hgofnC5RcmUkx3lqqZF7W1PHbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006805/jporter_211111_4873_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can switch between analog profiles using the shortcut buttons on the top right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ob5nfa"&gt;These control schemes are very specific to certain genres, so thankfully, it’s possible to save three analog profiles on the keyboard, and then you switch between them using the keyboard’s A1, A2, and A3 keys. You can also save additional profiles and swap them into one of these shortcut slots when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7tNmu"&gt;That’s the theory, but in practice, it’s a bit more of a mixed bag. Initially, I thought that any games that rely on keyboard for movement and mouse for camera and aiming controls would be a great match for the Wooting Two HE. A mouse is indisputably more accurate for aiming, but a gamepad’s left analog stick offers more fine-grained movement. But the problem is that a lot of games simply aren’t set up to let you control movement using what is effectively an emulated gamepad, alongside a traditional mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TPsxU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wooting’s software deals well with complexity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YZqaDm"&gt;When trying to play &lt;em&gt;Deathloop, &lt;/em&gt;I found that the game refused to allow me to use a mouse for aiming while it thought I was moving with an analog stick. And I had a similar problem in &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&lt;/em&gt;. Wooting is aware of these issues, but unfortunately, it’s something that would need to be addressed by individual game developers to fix. Look out for games that support “&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/w/index.php?title=Special:CargoQuery&amp;amp;tables=Infobox_game%2CInput&amp;amp;fields=Infobox_game._pageName%2CInfobox_game.Developers%2CInfobox_game.Publishers%2CInfobox_game.Released%2CInfobox_game.Available_on%2CInput.Simultaneous_input%3DSupported&amp;amp;where=Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27true%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27limited%27+OR+Input.Simultaneous_input%3D%27hackable%27&amp;amp;join_on=Infobox_game._pageName%3DInput._pageName&amp;amp;order_by%5B0%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60_pageName%60&amp;amp;order_by%5B1%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Developers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B2%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Publishers__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B3%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Released__full%60+&amp;amp;order_by%5B4%5D=%60cargo__Infobox_game%60.%60Available_on__full%60+&amp;amp;format=template&amp;amp;offset=100&amp;amp;limit=100&amp;amp;named_args=yes&amp;amp;intro=%3Ctable+style%3D%22text-align%3A+center%3B+margin%3A+0+auto%3B+width%3A+auto%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-true%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENative+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Limited+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-limited%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ELimited+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Always+on+%28no+native+option%29%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-always-on%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3EAlways+on%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22Hackable%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-hackable%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ERequires+manual+fix%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd+style%3D%22padding-left%3A25px%22%3E%3Cdiv+title%3D%22No+native+support%22+class%3D%22svg-icon+svg-25+tickcross-false%22%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Ctd%3E%3Cbig%3ENo+native+support%3C%2Fbig%3E%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E%0A%3C%2Ftable%3E%0A%0A%3Cdiv+style%3D%22margin-top%3A10px%22%3E%3Ccenter%3ENative+support+may+require+selecting+certain+settings+in+the+game+or+launcher.+Refer+to+the+individual+game+pages+for+details.%3C%2Fcenter%3E%3C%2Fdiv%3E%0A%0A%3Ctable+class%3D%22wikitable+sortable%22+style%3D%22width%3A+100%25%3Btext-align%3A+center%22%3E%0A%09%3Ctr%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A195px%3B%22%3EGame%3C%2Ftd%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EDeveloper%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3EPublisher%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ERelease+date%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+30px%3B%22%3ESystems%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%09%3Cth+style%3D%22width%3A+20px%3B%22%3ESupported%3C%2Fth%3E%0A%09%3C%2Ftr%3E&amp;amp;template=Feature%2Frow&amp;amp;outro=%3C%2Ftable%3E"&gt;simultaneous input&lt;/a&gt;” if you want an indication that they’ll work with the Wooting Two HE, but be aware there are many out there where this won’t be an option without jumping through significant hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTQMBW"&gt;I had better luck with other titles. &lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead 2 &lt;/em&gt;worked without any issues, as did the &lt;em&gt;Halo: Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer beta and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, but unfortunately, none of these are games that benefit from being able to walk slowly. They’re pretty much designed for you to be running full-pelt at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umUQShPGZdyt1QFo-bhp1ruMV4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23034688/wootility_lekker_beta_YGQr4swUO2.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wooting’s software, featuring a keymap designed for racing games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKEZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; was perhaps the game that most played into the Wooting Two HE’s strengths. Analog control is perfect for the kind of delicate touch the game asks of you as you maneuver Sam Porter Bridges, laden with gear and deliveries, over difficult terrain. The experience wasn’t perfect, however, because of the way the on-screen button prompts would flit between showing keyboard and mouse or gamepad controls depending on what input method it thought you were using with the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CaYcZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; was a much bigger success because it saw me exclusively use the keyboard for control rather than using it alongside a mouse. Rather than using multiple small taps to try and smoothly turn the car, the Wooting Two HE let me half depress the A or D key to make a smooth turn, and I could also roll off the accelerator to try and recover from oversteer without having to either hit the brakes or stop accelerating entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pPSjna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many games were confused by the Wooting Two HE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i923M1"&gt;Despite the improvements, given the option, I’d still opt to play a racing game with a force-feedback-enabled controller or, even better, a full steering wheel. For the sake of balance, I tried racing with an Xbox One controller paired with my PC using Microsoft’s Xbox Wireless Adapter, and I immediately felt more at home in &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt;. Nothing beats being able to &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the car start to slide with your hands and then compensate accordingly, rather than having to look out for audiovisual cues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLw5KN"&gt;Maybe this is an unfair comparison. After all, Wooting doesn’t claim that its keyboard is capable of offering force feedback. But it highlights some of the drawbacks of a keyboard like the Two HE. In attempting to bridge the gap between a keyboard and a gamepad, it can end up feeling like a half measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWyTgp"&gt;I also ran into an annoying bug during my time with the keyboard. On more than one occasion, Windows refused to pick up the Wooting Two HE’s gamepad inputs at all. I could usually fix it by unplugging and then replugging the keyboard into my PC using USB or by following the &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__wooting.helpscoutdocs.com_article_38-2Danalog-2Dinput-2Dis-2Dnot-2Dworking&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=476jdkIgGUarAZOh8c7rGQ0y2cYvQOVP4r7SgCS1JPE&amp;amp;m=aIkdyzesyzqp1MsLS9Fxw5wrv2CcuyDmuVAW-yFFRbrTXlevOsPs7NDjDTA1t6HC&amp;amp;s=bP66pG50P7gnNfuNki_w7OyBcyGGPSiHRX1yVvQFib0&amp;amp;e="&gt;steps in Wooting’s troubleshooting guide&lt;/a&gt;, but it was far from seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRiG7WT5AWeyUuK9qPVN9vCfjeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006806/jporter_211111_4873_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wooting Two HE in a UK-ISO layout. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4Zs8v"&gt;The Wooting Two HE achieves more or less what it says it’ll achieve. Its keys are capable of registering analog inputs, and its software makes it easy to remap them to function as gamepad controls. It delivers on its promises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4r0Wc"&gt;But its biggest problem is that it’s a niche product that most PC games aren’t designed to accommodate, and the result is that several of the titles I tried got confused when they sensed me using a gamepad and mouse simultaneously. That’s not the fault of Wooting, but ultimately, its keyboard is operating in an ecosystem that doesn’t recognize it exists. Meanwhile, the benefits of other features like an adjustable actuation point and more responsive keypresses are marginal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aBpRis"&gt;If you only want to use one peripheral for your PC gaming, then the Wooting Two HE is a much more flexible alternative than most regular keyboards. But I’d stop short of claiming it can match a traditional gamepad, and I think most people would be better off with having both peripherals in their arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony (update: sold out) </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony just got a restock of the PS5&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InjNmw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 22nd, 8:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Sony appears to have sold out of PS5 consoles for the day. We’ll make sure to let you know when the next opportunity comes up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw7TZO"&gt;If you’re still trying to get your hands on a PlayStation 5, lining up at Sony’s digital storefront is one of the more reliable ways to snag Sony’s next-gen console. Sony &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;has reopened the digital queue on its direct store&lt;/a&gt; to place orders for the $500 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;disc-based PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the $400 &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/hardware/ps5"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqKvo7"&gt;Provided you’ve already &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/ps5"&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; and logged into your PlayStation account, you should be able to line up once you’ve hit the landing page. Once you’ve entered the queue, you’ll be given an ETA of when you’ll be able to check out and, once that timer hits zero, it's all systems go. It's no secret that these consoles go quick and getting into the queue doesn’t necessarily guarantee a console, but Sony’s direct store remains one of the more reliable ways to get ahold of the PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HI8v4N"&gt;If you’re still deliberating which console is the better fit for you, let's chat a little about the differences between these two consoles. Both models of the PS5, the standard model ($500) and the Digital Edition ($400), are virtually identical with the exception of the inclusion of a UHD Blu-Ray disc drive on the standard edition. Because it doesn’t have a disc drive, the Digital Edition is a little lighter and slimmer, but still features the same 825GB SSD. Both consoles are compatible with the same games, however,&lt;/p&gt;
