    <title>Android Go reaches 200 million daily users just in time for Android 12 update </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yn7gFv8lsWlsZtD3A1evFGpj1EQ=/222x0:3822x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270195/android12_go_edition.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CprF08"&gt;Android Go, the lightweight version of the full-featured OS, has officially reached &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-android-12-go-edition/"&gt;over 200 million daily users&lt;/a&gt;. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16736260/google-android-oreo-go-edition"&gt;first launched Android Go in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, offering a smoother Android experience for users on entry-level devices with 2GB of RAM or less.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIbIqvAnB0kFGvWJkWFp--KU69Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087202/android_12_go_speed.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apps on Android 12 (Go edition) open 30 percent faster.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GZ6AOl"&gt;Now, Google has also announced that some of these affordable devices will receive an update to Android 12 (Go edition), bringing a host of features from the standard, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;newly released Android 12&lt;/a&gt; to more devices. Most notably, phones with Android 12 (Go edition) will open apps up to 30 percent faster and with smoother animation. Google says that apps will open without delay, eliminating the short period in which you might see a blank screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxE6Tn"&gt;Other features, like the privacy dashboard, are already available in the standard version of Android 12, letting you view and access your app permissions from one hub. You might also recognize the on-screen translation tool, automatic app hibernation that helps conserve your phone’s battery life, along with the handy feature that lets you share an app with nearby devices, preventing other users from having to use data to download it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmAYJl"&gt;Right now, it’s still unclear which devices will get the Android 12 (Go edition) update or when exactly the update will be rolled out. Google says it’s slated for 2022 but has yet to pinpoint a specific date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap launches Story Studio, a standalone video editing app for mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBCr_L6oTWwBrKLxiXfi5Fd_pOA=/0x0:1967x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270100/snap_story_studio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Promo images of Snap’s Story Studio. | Images: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C27Ktl"&gt;Snap has launched a standalone video editing app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/story-studio/id1566585014"&gt;Story Studio&lt;/a&gt;, which is meant to give creators more precise editing control over vertical videos and allow them to add elements like text, trending audio, and AR lenses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445373/snap-ios-story-studio-app-video-edit-app-spotlight"&gt;First announced&lt;/a&gt; in May, the app is now available as an “early version” to iOS users in the US, UK, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19GTj2"&gt;Story Studio, which Snap says is being “built alongside creators,” is meant to be a more advanced video editing tool, like for creators using Spotlight. Launched a year ago, Spotlight is Snap’s response to TikTok — videos edited in Story Studio can be exported directly to Spotlight or a user’s Snapchat story. Videos can be downloaded and shared on other platforms, and they aren’t watermarked, unlike TikToks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Us4lu"&gt;Snap also announced that since the launch of Spotlight last November, the company has paid out more than $250 million to 12,000 creators. The company says it’s paying millions per month to users with top performing Spotlight submissions but did not specify an exact number. Snap says it will continue to offer a “range of opportunities” to reward popular creators but didn’t say whether the millions in payments per month would continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WUfHw"&gt;Snap still faces stiff competition in the mobile video space from TikTok and Instagram Reels, and Facebook said in July it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;will pay out $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; through 2022. Though Snap says that Spotlight creators are posting three times as often as they were when the feature was announced, it’s still a relatively new product, and it’s up against behemoths like TikTok with 1 billion monthly users. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Army is in hot water over TikTok recruiting activity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7kIlvE34OLHPBSfk_vdBFMwgYrg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70270063/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CnG5Ad"&gt;The US Army is facing pressure from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) after &lt;a href="https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/12/rubio-urges-army-to-enforce-ban-of-tiktok-for-recruitment"&gt;recruiters were caught using TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to find leads on young Americans to enlist, despite orders banning the app’s use on government devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUxn13"&gt;Issued on Monday to Army Secretary Christine Wormuth, Rubio’s letter comes in response to &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/11/army-recruiters-tiktok-dance-around-ban-reach-gen-z/186935/"&gt;a recent report from &lt;em&gt;Nextgov&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;describing how recruiters struggle to reach young adults online. The report detailed how many Army recruiters are ignoring the military’s TikTok ban, often using their own personal devices to create videos and reach out to young users to find enlistment leads. Some recruiters, like @njrecruiter, tout nearly 500,000 followers on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9EC54"&gt;In his letter, Rubio pressures Wormuth to take additional enforcement actions, citing possible threats posed by the app’s use due to its alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHGv2i"&gt;“Armed with biometric and other personal data, the CCP is able to track, monitor, and collect information on Americans anywhere in the world,” Rubio wrote. “From a military perspective, it can track troop movements, build source networks, or compile biographic profiles on military members for purposes of intelligence collection, exploitation, and manipulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Ldy1"&gt;Rubio also asks Wormuth to disclose how many Army recruiters use their personal devices for recruitment purposes and whether the Army has any protocols for ensuring soldiers do not download or use TikTok in a personal capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3dMu9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/31/21044559/us-army-bans-soldiers-from-using-tiktok"&gt;The Army first banned the use of TikTok&lt;/a&gt; in December 2019, but recruiters continue to use the app. Rubio also highlighted accounts like @njrecruiter, writing “I urge you to take decisive action to immediately end this practice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3ZWZE"&gt;The Army’s press team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 7 is $50 off and Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 hits a new low price</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQWZIa"&gt;It can be a little anxiety-inducing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;shop for holiday tech gifts&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of December. Black Friday and its deals feel like a long-forgotten tale of folklore, and there is only so much time remaining to make the purchase, get it, wrap it, and place it under the tree. But we’re always finding you the best deals each and every day, and today we have some great ones for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQAUIY"&gt;Starting off, the Apple Watch Series 7 has hit a new all-time low price this week. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F129685296%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578187165&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-series-7%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_6549129%3Fq%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26redirectQuery%3DApple%2BWatch%2BSeries%2B7%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have a selection of Series 7 smartwatches for $50 off, including the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;base 41mm and 45mm aluminum models with GPS&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-aluminum-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84736575%3Fpreselect%3D77640216%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;cellular-equipped counterparts&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-stainless-steel-series-7-gps-cellular%2F-%2FA-84783483%3Fpreselect%3D77640147%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;the stainless steel model&lt;/a&gt;. Each one is $50 off, and that brings the base model &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-7-gps%2F-%2FA-84736576%3Fpreselect%3D77640160%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;41mm Series 7 down to a new low of about $350&lt;/a&gt;. The previous lowest price was only a $20 discount, so this is a prime opportunity to get Apple’s latest watch with a larger, edge-to-edge display until the deal ends on December 18th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="thvhUI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10860351"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MmLlQN"&gt;If you’re on a tighter budget, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fpl%2F328828651%3Fmarketing_id%3D3290-1911863578181648&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Felectronics%2Fapple-watch-se%2F3944_1229722_1890925_1696849_2926746%3Fq%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26redirectQuery%3Dapple%2Bwatch%2Bse%26search_redirect%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have various Apple Watch SE configurations for $50 off. The base &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-aluminum-case%2F-%2FA-81498739%3Fpreselect%3D77640223%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals121421"&gt;40mm aluminum version with GPS is now just $229.99&lt;/a&gt; — not its lowest price ever like its Series 7 counterpart, but the SE contains much of the innards from the previous flagship Series 6 at a much friendlier price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wpmPME"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUeq5"&gt;Now, for another all-time great deal that Android fans can actually enjoy, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B097CNBDX2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3 has hit a new low price of $1,349.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is this deal $150 better than its previous lowest cost, but it also comes with a free pair of Galaxy Buds 2. Be sure to check the extra savings or special offer lines on the Amazon listing, and click the dedicated button to add both to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0mkqI"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest flagship foldable, with a 6.2-inch outer screen and unfolding 7.6-inch inner display. While the Fold line first came to market with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411510/samsung-galaxy-fold-broken-screen-debris-dust-hinge-flexible-bulge"&gt;easily breakable and flawed design&lt;/a&gt;, it has now developed into something &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Dieter Bohn called “nearly normal” — which is high praise when you think about a smartphone with a screen you fold up and put in your pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7jnw8"&gt;Today’s deal brings the price down by a whole $450 for any of the color options in its 256GB storage configuration. If you want to be the most unique kid on your block by using a foldable phone, this price is as good as it gets for the phone-unfolds-into-small-tablet form factor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="n4269r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google releases first Android 12L beta for large-screen devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824287/google-android-12-beta-1-release-large-screen-devices-tablet-pixel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="aywFuG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10919310"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="925RjI"&gt;While those prior deals can be a bit polarizing if you only use iPhones or you only use Android, here is one that everyone can enjoy. Woot currently has some &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeries7121421/https://tools.woot.com/plus/meross-smart-home-products-7?ref=w_cnt_cdet_tool_dly_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exceptional deals on a couple of Meross smart home products&lt;/a&gt;, including a three-way smart dimmer switch kit for interior lighting and a garage door opener remote for easy access to your car hole, regardless of your location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqJ1IF"&gt;Meross is a solid choice for budget-friendly HomeKit-compatible smart home accessories. While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter isn’t here to save us from smart home complexity just yet&lt;/a&gt;, this garage door opener is compatible with Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings. All you need is your smartphone to let yourself, or someone else while you’re away, into your garage. It’s normally priced at $49.99, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeAppleWatchSeriesSale121421/https://tools.woot.com/offers/meross-smart-garage-door-opener-remote-2?ref=w_cnt_wp_0_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has it for just $35&lt;/a&gt;. This discount runs until December 18th, and the units are in new condition with a full one-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8yz33f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 home tech holiday gift guide","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22752612/smart-home-tech-holiday-gift-guide-2021-kitchen-lighting-speakers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="g74J9I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10919412"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6sZ7yT"&gt;From the smart home to the TV streaming front, few set-tops have the loyal fan base of the Nvidia Shield TV line, thanks to its fast performance and flexible compatibility with apps like Plex. The newer Nvidia Shield TV Pro is the higher-end model over its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935215/nvidia-shield-tv-2019-review-streaming-stick-dolby-vision-4k-price-specs-features"&gt;tube-shaped sibling&lt;/a&gt;, running Android TV and compatible with all the major streaming apps. It looks a lot like the older model from 2015, but it packs a faster Tegra X1 Plus processor and supports Dolby Vision HDR. All of these improvements come at a bit of a cost, but you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YP9FBMM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Shield TV Pro for $20 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, knocking the price down to $179.99. If you don’t mind splurging for a TV streaming device that’s faster and more capable, saving money on the Shield TV Pro is a great option and solid alternative to the Apple TV 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VMOtnp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10919342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="45viBF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/12/13/22832836/apple-macbook-air-m1-processor-cpu-lowest-price-deal-sale"&gt;Yesterday&lt;/a&gt; saw an especially good daily deal on the MacBook Air with M1 processor at Best Buy, matching its best price to date.

    <title>Nicolas Cage takes on his most challenging role yet: Nicolas Cage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vtzn9Egdvb1tCROeGnp4DJAcXXo=/176x0:859x455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269963/Screen_Shot_2021_12_14_at_11.56.33_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3XLe"&gt;Do you ever watch a Nicolas Cage movie and think, “He just wasn’t Nick Cage enough for me”? Well, that shouldn’t be a problem in &lt;em&gt;The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming movie in which Cage plays himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xHqht"&gt;It’s described as an “action-adventure,” and the premise is something else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UQwFKB"&gt;Creatively unfulfilled and facing financial ruin, the fictionalized version of Cage must accept a $1 million offer to attend the birthday of a dangerous superfan (Pedro Pascal). Things take a wildly unexpected turn when Cage is recruited by a CIA operative (Tiffany Haddish) and forced to live up to his own legend, channeling his most iconic and beloved on-screen characters in order to save himself and his loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2bq2m"&gt;The first teaser looks appropriately ridiculous, with Cage hamming it up in the best way, seemingly very much in on the joke. It kind of makes me want to watch &lt;em&gt;The Croods 2 &lt;/em&gt;— and maybe even revisit&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260020/prisoners-of-the-ghostland-review-sundance-nic-cage-sion-sono"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The movie is coming to theaters on April 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nomad adds magnets to its Base Station wireless charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0-NCiB5ih0nq1SmsE7K1Go1l4fw=/0x0:5899x3933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269880/856500018928_Lifestyle_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomad Base Station Hub with magnetic alignment&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D1pWM"&gt;Nomad is updating its line of wireless chargers with the latest version of the Base Station Hub. A multi-device charger that can wirelessly charge up to two devices at the same time, plus charge two more devices through its USB ports, the new Base Station Hub now has embedded magnets to help align devices in the right spot on the pad. The new Hub costs $119.95 and is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub-magnetic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for purchase starting today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMjCHA"&gt;Aside from the magnets, the new Hub is very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeNomadBaseStation121421/https://nomadgoods.com/products/base-station-hub" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nomad’s prior version&lt;/a&gt;. It has three charging coils under a leather pad that are each capable of up to 10W charging (iPhones will be limited to 7.5W). On the back of the charger is an 18W USB-C port and a 7.5W USB-A port for other devices. Nomad also sells an attachment that affixes to the back of the Hub and holds an Apple Watch charger (not included) that you plug into one of the USB ports on the back or a separate brick. It’s less elegant than the multi-device chargers that have Apple Watch chargers built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8BAkh"&gt;The biggest challenge with wireless charging pads is making sure your phone or device is put in the right place to actually charge. That’s where the magnets in the new Hub come in: they make it easy to tell when your compatible iPhone (12 or newer), AirPods, or even a Google Pixel 6 is in the right spot to charge efficiently. The magnets are not as strong as those in Apple’s MagSafe charger or most MagSafe accessories — they aren’t designed to hold your phone in place if an earthquake happens. But they do noticeably attach and align the phone in the right place when you put it down, which is the whole point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zytiU21ytftKWHObC2sfBOyWuQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085820/856500018928_G.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nomad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under the Base Station Hub’s leather pad are three charging coils surrounded by magnets, which help align compatible devices so they charge efficiently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="11PnIJ"&gt;The Base Station Hub is not as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21399941/nomad-base-station-pro-review-wireless-charger-aira-freepower-price"&gt;Nomad’s old Base Station Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which used a complex array of charging coils and was meant to let you just plop your phone down wherever and have it charge. But that device had significant limitations and compatibility issues with phones that used MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obtjdT"&gt;Ultimately, when it comes to wireless chargers, the most important thing is knowing that your device will charge when you place it down. The new Base Station Hub makes that just a little bit easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp can now preview voice messages before sending them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/llb-JE3s_wIFpKmWNVgR8FU6ggo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269844/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjCsng"&gt;WhatsApp has recently released a preview feature for voice messages, letting you check whether your ramblings vaguely make sense before inflicting them on others. The Meta-owned messaging service said that the feature has been slowly rolling out in recent weeks, and that it’s now available across all platforms including iOS, Android, web, and desktop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7n07ZX"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/android/chats/how-to-preview-a-voice-message/?lang=en"&gt;help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, the option to preview a voice message appears after you press the stop button to finish a recording. You can then preview it with the triangular play icon, delete it with the trash can icon, or send it with the send button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AdGHKq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re not mistakes, they’re rehearsals. Now you can preview your voice messages before you hit send. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ohnEVrGTvD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ohnEVrGTvD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WhatsApp (@WhatsApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1470801332118474758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prcahL"&gt;Audio previews are one part of a flurry of new updates that have either been released or are reportedly in development around WhatsApp’s voice message feature. Earlier this year, the service added the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/22/whatsapp-beta-gets-playback-speed-options-for-voice-messages/"&gt;adjust the playback speed of voice notes during listening&lt;/a&gt; (perfect for quickly getting through long and rambling messages), and &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-the-ability-to-pause-voice-recordings/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll also soon be possible to pause and resume recording of a voice message. We’ve been able to verify that the latter feature is available in the beta version of WhatsApp for iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43IJUe"&gt;But more interesting features may be on the horizon. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671185/whatsapp-voice-notes-transcription-ios"&gt;WhatsApp confirmed&lt;/a&gt; it was in the early stages of developing a new voice transcription feature that could one day allow you to read a transcription of a voice message rather than listening to it. Then, in October, &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-a-global-voice-message-player/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that it had also found signs of a “global voice message player” feature that would let users listen to voice notes while browsing other WhatsApp chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Cq9G1"&gt;There’s no information available as to when (or even if, in some cases) WhatsApp may roll out these new voice message features. But being able to preview a voice note before sending it is a promising start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former FCC officials are worried about air safety fears delaying 5G rollout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yy5gINqsvBIFWWrMcbOmPWXC7lk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269778/acastro_180430_1777_5G_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PJOxGH"&gt;US mobile carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;delaying their 5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; thanks to an ongoing spat between two government agencies, and it doesn’t look like the situation will be resolving soon. As &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/six-former-fcc-chiefs-concerned-over-aviation-agency-5g-stance?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a group of six former FCC chiefs have sent a letter dated this Monday saying they were “concerned about the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) recent efforts to revisit the FCC’s 2020 decision” to open up the C-band to 5G applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBL4R"&gt;At heart, the argument is between the federal agencies tasked with regulating airplanes and airwaves: the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The agencies disagree about whether it’s safe to allow 5G equipment to operate within a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the C-band. The FAA says that doing so threatens the safety of aircraft, as 5G signals could interfere with the operation of certain altimeters (used to measure height above the ground). The FCC is complying with the FAA’s requests, but some third-party experts say these air safety fears are overblown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="67hVg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sMUkCx"&gt;“The FAA position threatens to derail the reasoned conclusions reached by the FCC after years of technical analysis and study,” said the authors of the recent letter, former FCC chiefs Ajit Pai, Tom Wheeler, Mignon Clyburn, Julius Genachowski, Michael Copps, and Michael Powell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xepu8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports that the letter was sent to current FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel and Evelyn Remaley, acting assistant secretary of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (another agency involved in telecoms regulation). The letter reportedly encourages the FCC and the FAA to work together in finding a solution for this problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOfDx"&gt;As a result of the FAA’s objections, Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T have delayed the expansion of their 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;until at least January 5th&lt;/a&gt;. That expansion was set to use the C-band spectrum, which the FAA says threatens aircraft safety. And just last week, the FAA ruled that certain aircraft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822875/5g-faa-rule-c-band-landing-airport-bad-weather-visibility"&gt;would not be able to land using guided and automatic systems&lt;/a&gt; because of worries these programs could be affected by 5G equipment. The result of this may well be flight delays, thought it’s impossible to say how widespread these problems could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw2btY"&gt;But for some industry watchers, the delay to the 5G rollout isn’t just frustrating — it’s nonsensical. They argue that a key FAA study supposedly showing 5G interference with altimeters doesn’t really support the agency’s claims, and note that 40 other countries have already approved or operate 5G equipment in the worrisome C-band without any trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14ZEqE"&gt;“Either physics works differently in the US, or the report at the center of this controversy needs to explain why [interference] hasn’t shown up in any other country where deployments are either authorized or have already taken place,” writes Harold Feld, a senior vice president of the consumer advocacy group Public Knowledge, in an &lt;a href="https://wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/what-the-eff-faa-my-insanely-long-field-guide-to-the-faa-fcc-5g-c-band-fight/"&gt;excellent explainer on the spat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGcE71"&gt;How, exactly, the two agencies will find a resolution and stop fighting over the airwaves is unclear. In a statement reacting to the FCC letter, the FAA told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;: “[W]e continue to work with federal agencies and the wireless companies.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iPhone’s new App Privacy Report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6oUxAjmsCkK_KjPTdkuTVnGPHU=/0x0:828x552/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269752/IMG_F070E3C6CB84_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vk9q6w"&gt;Information is power, and if you’re an iPhone user, you can now get more information about how often your apps access your data (for example, your location or your microphone). The App Privacy Report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;which became available with iOS 15.2&lt;/a&gt;, also lets you know each app’s web activity and what domains they attach to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDSraO"&gt;The feature is off by default, but if your phone has updated to iOS 15.2, it’s very simple to turn on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2r1zTG"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; App Privacy Report (which will be at the bottom of the screen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Y0O6T"&gt;Select “Turn On App Privacy Report”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

&lt;p id="4GD0oA"&gt;After that, you can follow the same series of selections to see your report. (You can also use &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71047d5a577b488397247b7a1081e0fd"&gt;this Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; for quicker access right from your home screen or a Siri voice command.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjoYu"&gt;You won’t immediately see any data — it takes time for your phone to collect the data and assemble the report, but you can start to see results in just a few minutes. The report will let you know the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IrZ5Yz"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Which apps accessed your data within the last seven days.&lt;/strong&gt; If you tap on one of the apps listed, you will be able to see exactly when the last accesses were. You will probably have to drill down a couple of pages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Sp65IE"&gt;

    <title>Toyota’s electric vehicle plans are getting bigger and more expensive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycSCHiwIbdzrftl2sDBTLWoSpxg=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70269647/20211214_BEV_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lpDFL3"&gt;Toyota is ramping up its electric vehicle production schedule, vowing to release 30 electric vehicles by 2030 rather than just 15 EVs by 2025, as was previously promised. The Japanese automaker also vowed to sell 3.5 million battery EVs globally by 2030 and to transform Lexus into an EV-only brand by 2035.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKQa9D"&gt;The company said it would invest 2 trillion yen ($17.6 billion) in battery vehicle technology, an increase over its previous commitment of 1.5 trillion yen ($13.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q47Zfx"&gt;Toyota was an early pioneer in electrification, helping pave the way for companies like Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. But the company has since fallen far behind its competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WDyBfR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota was an early pioneer in hybrid tech but has since fallen far behind its competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJas62"&gt;Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. Toyota, meanwhile, has yet to release a long-range electric vehicle. And the company’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TmugB4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10919409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aoYaR6"&gt;But in an event Tuesday, Toyoda changed his tune, touting the need for the company to reduce tailpipe emissions by releasing more EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PCCMJ"&gt;“I believe that achieving carbon neutrality means realizing a world in which all people living on this planet continue to live happily,” Toyoda said. “We want to help realize such a world. This has been and will continue to be Toyota’s wish and our mission as a global company. For that challenge, we need to reduce CO2 emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goZmwu"&gt;As part of the announcement, Toyota showed several dozen concept vehicles, including sedans, sports cars, crossovers, SUVs, pickup trucks, and even a couple of boxy shuttles. The company didn’t release many details about each vehicle but did note that a planned Lexus sports car would have a “cruising range” of 700 km (434 miles) and be able to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in under two seconds. Toyota’s first long-range EV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752539/toyota-bz4x-electric-suv-steering-yoke-solar-roof"&gt;the BZ4X compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, is expected to be released in the US in mid-2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FPio05"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota is planning on spending some of its promised $17.6 billion in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwpnfe"&gt;Toyota is planning on spending some of its promised $17.6 billion in the US. The company recently announced a $1.29 billion battery factory in North Carolina as part of its plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662236/toyota-battery-investment-electric-cars-hybrids-2030"&gt;invest around $13.6 billion in battery tech&lt;/a&gt; over the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QepYs5"&gt;But despite its expanding commitment to EVs, Toyota is still spending a lot of money in Washington, DC, to lobby against President Joe Biden’s efforts to encourage Americans to buy more EVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtSoOJ"&gt;Congressional Democrats have proposed increasing the federal EV tax credit from $7,500 to $12,500 for purchases of electric vehicles made in the US by unionized workers, triggering a backlash from non-union companies like Tesla and Toyota. The Japanese automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/qll6xa/toyota_full_page_ad_in_the_wsj_screams_antiunion/"&gt;run full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; accusing Biden and the Democrats of “play[ing] politics with the environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
