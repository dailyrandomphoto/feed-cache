    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A natural experiment in Vermont helped show the impacts&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="81dPMw"&gt;In late October 2020, the University of Vermont Health Network was hit by a ransomware attack. The system couldn’t access electronic health records for &lt;a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/uvm-health-brings-ehr-back-online-one-month-after-ransomware-attack"&gt;nearly a month&lt;/a&gt;. Every computer at UVM Medical Center was infected with malware. Hospitals in the network &lt;a href="https://threatpost.com/cyberattack-uvm-health-network/161059/"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; chemotherapy and mammogram appointments, just as COVID-19 cases in the United States started to tick upward in what would become an enormous winter wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hn4juj"&gt;Intuitively, cyberattacks on hospitals seem like they’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;dangerous for patients&lt;/a&gt;. Shutting down computer systems shuts off access to patient scans, can lock physicians out of tools they need to provide care, and creates backlogs in the operating systems. But despite years of attacks, there’s very little data on whether those disruptions actually caused harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RRyU4"&gt;The specific circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, though, gave experts an opening to see what the UVM attack meant for patient care. Because hospital systems were already strained caring for COVID-19 patients, any additional stressors — like a ransomware attack — could be seen more clearly. So, when a team at the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) scrutinized the data, they were able to show that patients did worse in hospitals navigating a cyberware attack than in hospitals that didn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YdWeeD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lIVMQx"&gt;The findings, which are still unpublished, should help push back on any groups hesitant to say that cyberattacks are dangerous for patients, says Josh Corman, a senior adviser to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568397/covid-vaccine-cybersecurity-cisa-task-force"&gt;CISA&lt;/a&gt;, the federal agency that advises on government and private sector cybersecurity issues. “We should stop pretending that there is no harm to human life from cyber attacks,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vZ7R8Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sAnHti"&gt;Data in the field is so thin that experts turn to marathons to make the argument that cyberattacks will harm patients. They often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18293817/cybersecurity-hospitals-health-care-scan-simulation"&gt;point to&lt;/a&gt; one particular bit of research: &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1614073"&gt;a 2017 paper&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;New England Journal of Medicine&lt;/em&gt; that looked at emergency care during marathons in the United States. The study found people who had heart attacks during a marathon were at higher risk of death within a month than people who had heart attacks on other days, likely because it took longer for them to get the care they needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIKw6G"&gt;It’s not a perfect analogy, but like marathons (which close roads and cause delays for ambulances), ransomware attacks can force hospitals to divert ambulances or delay treatments. It’s one of the clearer pieces of evidence available. It has been hard to get a good picture of the same phenomenon during ransomware attacks because the numbers tend to be so small, says Mark Jarrett, chief quality officer at Northwell Health in New York. “You really need an approach that looks at data across the country, so you can get a large enough denominator that you’ll be able to get a numerator that really means something,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9ecZ3"&gt;Hospitals also tend to be tight-lipped about ransomware attacks. They &lt;a href="https://www.nj.com/business/2019/12/hackensack-meridian-hospital-chain-confirms-ransomware-attack-last-week.html"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21482304/ransomware-outage-hospital-chain-cybersecurity"&gt;go days&lt;/a&gt; before announcing that systems are down because of a cyberattack, and often &lt;a href="https://www.hcinnovationgroup.com/cybersecurity/data-breaches/news/21153617/six-weeks-later-new-yorks-samaritan-health-still-recovering-from-malware-attack"&gt;don’t share&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/scripps-health-still-grappling-with-impact-of-may-1-ransomware-attack/"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.villages-news.com/2021/06/03/new-coo-takes-over-as-ransomware-attack-cripples-the-villages-hospital/"&gt;details&lt;/a&gt; about the impact an attack is actually having on day-to-day operations. It would likely be a challenge to convince an organization to agree to any investigation into the impact of an attack on its patient care, says Sung Choi, assistant professor at the University of Central Florida department of health management and informatics who studies healthcare cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hcrHHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vVDvqQ"&gt;“They’re very careful about releasing data on mortality, because that links directly to the reputation of the hospital,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9p3bIv"&gt;There hasn’t even been a close analysis of the potential health harms from the 2017 WannaCry cyberattack, which downed computers across the United Kingdom’s National Health Service and threw the system into chaos, Corman says. Just looking at stroke patients should give a sense of what the harm might have been, he says — if people having a stroke don’t make it to a health facility that can handle the emergency quickly, they’re more likely to have a bad outcome. During a few days of the WannaCry attack, there were no stroke centers open in London. “The official line is that no one died. It strains credulity,” he says. “There’s such a palpable, visceral reluctance to admit that we’ve lost lives because of cybersecurity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aODhm8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Connecting the dots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrDHod"&gt;The pandemic gave Corman and his team at CISA an opening to get a clearer picture of the harm caused by ransomware attacks. The work started with its analysis of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/14/us/covid-19-death-toll.html"&gt;excess death&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic. Excess deaths, which count the number of deaths above normal during a given time of the year, help outline the true toll of an event like a COVID-19 outbreak — it helps show COVID-19 deaths that may have not been counted in the official toll, and how many people may have died because of disruptions in their care during the chaos of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzAEdB"&gt;The team was interested in trying to figure out ways to predict when there might be excess deaths regionally or nationally. Normally, when hospitals get overburdened because of a local emergency, they’re able to divert ambulances, reschedule surgeries, and lean on the other healthcare resources in the community. There’s slack in the system to make that possible. Eventually, they might reach a point where they weren’t able to provide adequate care to the people they were treating, but it would take a long time to reach that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgwxX8"&gt;But during COVID-19 outbreaks, every hospital was under stress. “No one could absorb anything,” Corman says. “Regions could shift through this more quickly.” They’d reach a point where there were too many patients to handle faster than normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnmmnZ"&gt;In their analysis, the CISA team figured out that once an area had a certain percentage of intensive care unit beds filled, they were more likely to start to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later. It was an inflection point — a strong indicator that the area was approaching a capacity issue that would tip over into higher death rates, Corman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zDLhDC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was a natural experiment in the state”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIxQB"&gt;With that metric in mind, the CISA team looked at the excess death data in the state of Vermont during the UVM ransomware attack. “It was a natural experiment in the state,” Corman says. They found that during the same time period, with the pandemic going on in the background, hospitals affected by the ransomware attack reached that inflection point earlier than unaffected hospitals and remained there longer. “You’re reaching that danger zone where you’re going to see excess deaths two, four, and six weeks later more quickly,” he says. “Water is wet, fire is hot, and we can now tell that cyber disruption introduces degraded or delayed patient care.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mX6DWB"&gt;Data scientists working on the project also think Vermont was the best-case scenario, Corman says — in other states with poorer overall health, the effect might be more dramatic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNtGt"&gt;The UVM Medical Center did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w48rAi"&gt;The pandemic created an environment where the CISA team was able to see the impact of ransomware more easily — excess deaths were already so high that the trends and patterns were easy to pick out. The same patterns, though, likely hold true outside of the pandemic, Corman says. A ransomware attack puts stress on a hospital system, delaying care, which could lead to bad outcomes. The impact may be less dramatic when there isn’t another emergency, but experts could use the same framework to scrutinize ransomware attacks at any time.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vpkpqk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yhVD38"&gt;The CISA analysis is still ongoing and circulating through the federal government, and Corman isn’t sure when the final conclusions will be published. But having a quantitative picture of how ransomware affects patient health could help spur organizations dragging their heels on cybersecurity into action, Northwell Health’s Jarrett says. “Patient safety should always be driven by data, so having the data will make a big difference.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1A00a"&gt;Data from CISA could be a good first step. Jarrett hopes there could also be analysis of harm to patients who don’t necessarily die, but who have worse health outcomes because of delays in their care. “Not everyone dies, thankfully,” he says. But a heart attack patient who isn’t seen quickly enough could have permanent damage. “Your health going forward is not going to be the same level.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1zofjk"&gt;Any hospital facing down a ransomware attack should do their own analysis of what went wrong and what the implications were for patients, Jarrett says. “Clinicians in general tend to think of this as an information technology issue, and it really isn’t. It’s a patient safety issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BvuW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gp7w1B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC says Facebook has been a monopoly ‘since at least 2011’ in amended antitrust complaint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SycXJmpiUoH2WDxxj3-g3fucw3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747985/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auMO0T"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21045875-facebook-revised-ftc-complaint"&gt;an amended antitrust complaint against Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that the company violated federal antitrust laws with its acquisition of Instagram and WhatsApp. The new complaint is a more detailed version of a charge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554476/ftc-facebook-instagram-antitrust-case-whatsapp-federal-court"&gt;dismissed by the court in June&lt;/a&gt; for insufficient evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iF9MNw"&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market for US personal social networking services,” the complaint alleges, citing time spent and active-user metrics on the daily and monthly scale. “Individually and collectively, these metrics provide significant evidence of Facebook’s durable monopoly power in social networking services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF60pB"&gt;Facebook has until October 4th to issue a legal response to the complaint. In a post on Twitter, Facebook’s corporate account said the company was reviewing the complaint and “will have more to say soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BV6VIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has today, and has maintained since 2011, a dominant share of the relevant market”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oW3sSj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-facebook-illegal-monopolization"&gt;First filed in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC alleges that Facebook’s acquisitions of competing networks gave it monopoly power over social network services in the US. But the following June, the court dismissed the complaint, finding that the commission had failed to provide sufficient evidence that Facebook had monopoly power in social networks. However, the court gave the FTC an opportunity to file an amended complaint that addressed the concerns, eventually setting the deadline &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-ftc-asks-more-time-file-amended-complaint-facebook-case-2021-07-23/"&gt;for August 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udBnmO"&gt;Together with the amended complaint, the FTC also made clear that chair Lina Khan will continue to play an active role in the case. In July, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;called on Khan&lt;/a&gt; to recuse herself from the agency’s lawsuit against the company based on her, based on her legal scholarship. “For the entirety of her professional career, Chair Khan has consistently and very publicly concluded that Facebook is guilty of violating the antitrust laws,” the company said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUFGhK"&gt;That effort appears to have been unsuccessful. “As the case will be prosecuted before a federal judge, the appropriate constitutional due process protections will be provided to the company,” the agency said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1428380607957045250?s=20"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufWtUE"&gt;In particular, the new complaint contains a more rigorous definition of personal social networks, the market in which Facebook holds the alleged monopoly. The new complaint explicitly distinguishes Facebook from services like TikTok, which broadcast content, but do not provide an explicitly social space. The FTC’s definition also excludes services like Twitter and Reddit that share information among communities with specific interests but “do not focus on connecting friends and family.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xa7VJ5"&gt;The complaint cites a number of internal messages to establish that Facebook understands this difference, although the specific content of the messages is redacted in the public version of the document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc6gfc"&gt;“Facebook... has been the dominant provider of such services since at least 2011,” the complaint concludes. “Further, Facebook Blue and Instagram are the two largest personal social networking services in the United States.” By the FTC’s definition, Facebook’s only significant competitor in the space is Snapchat, although defunct providers include Friendster, Myspace, Google+, and Path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RT9H6J"&gt;Once that market is defined, the complaint relies heavily on attention metrics to establish Facebook’s dominance — particularly monthly active users (MAUs), daily active users (DAUs) and time spent on-site — citing similar cases in Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom that have based their claims on those metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHeB7L"&gt;One weakness of this approach is that both Facebook and Instagram can serve multiple functions, raising the possibility that some of the metrics are in fact reflecting use of Facebook as a photo-sharing service, messaging platform, or other non-social purpose. But the FTC claims Facebook’s advantage by those metrics is so dominant as to swamp any alternative uses of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORVYi6"&gt;“Even if one were to assume, &lt;em&gt;arguendo&lt;/em&gt;, that half of the time that U.S. users spend on Facebook Blue and Instagram was not in fact spent using personal social networking services,” the FTC reasons, “Facebook would still have maintained a dominant share of the U.S. personal social networking market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSoJ9M"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Tesla’s AI day event </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zFPgb1hWmFA6kP1Emyr-uc25Ov0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747879/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZDnSUn"&gt;Today is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"&gt;Tesla’s AI Day&lt;/a&gt;, a sequel of sorts to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510828/tesla-elon-musk-autonomy-day-investor-comments-self-driving-cars-predictions"&gt;Autonomy Day&lt;/a&gt; event held in 2019. The event, which will be held at Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, CA, &lt;a href="https://livestream.tesla.com/"&gt;will be livestreamed for the public&lt;/a&gt; starting at 5PM PT / 8PM ET (though the event may not actually begin until closer to 5:30PM PT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O23w6E"&gt;We don’t have a lot of details about what will be announced, but based on the invitation, we’ll get a keynote address by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, hardware and software demos from Tesla engineers, test rides in the Model S Plaid, and “more.” Musk has also tweeted that the “sole goal” of the event is to lure experts in the field of robotics and artificial intelligence to come work at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YriMOi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has been holding events to highlight certain technologies that the company views as essential to its future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yZD9Yb"&gt;Tesla usually holds around two public events a year. This year, we got the Tesla Model S Plaid launch event in June, and now AI Day. Over the past few years, Tesla has been holding events, not to unveil new products, but to highlight certain technologies that the company views as crucial to its future development. Last year, Tesla held its first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450840/tesla-battery-day-production-elon-musk-tabless-range-cathode-cobalt-plaid"&gt;Battery Day event&lt;/a&gt;, at which it discussed plans to drive down the cost of battery development with the goal of producing a $25,000 electric car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tfSJ58"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from Tesla’s AI day event","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22627101/tesla-event-ai-day-rumors-elon-musk-what-to-expect"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ywbAs5"&gt;AI Day is expected to pick up on the themes first introduced during Autonomy Day, which include the manufacturing of Tesla’s own silicon computer chips to power it’s Full Self-Driving advanced driver assistance feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXcb56"&gt;This AI Day comes at an awkward time for the company. Earlier this week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; for the nearly dozen incidents in which its cars crashed into emergency vehicles. Two Democratic senators also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate&lt;/a&gt; Tesla’s marketing practices for potentially misleading information. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Battery power capacity in the US grew big time in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Cooperative Connexus Energy Builds Minnesota’s First Large-Scale Energy Storage System" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVor0NaPIkGzDpZ47Cxa1cUOFLs=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747812/1031531618.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A worker installs solar panel at the Connexus Energy Athens Township solar-plus-storage project site in Athens Township, Minnesota, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018.  | Ari Lindquist/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qibmO"&gt;2020 was a big year for big batteries in the US, which is crucial for getting grids to run on more renewable energy. Power capacity — a measure of how much power a battery can instantly discharge — for large-scale batteries grew at an unprecedented pace in the US last year, according to an annual &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/analysis/studies/electricity/batterystorage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released this week by the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HmkjbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcHGs2"&gt;2020 smashed the previous record set in 2018 for the biggest growth in power capacity in the US with 489MW of large-scale battery storage added. That’s more than twice what was added in 2018. By the end of last year, there was 1,523MW of large-scale battery power capacity in the US. For comparison, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.sunpower.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fcs-solar-star-projects-fact-sheet_0.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F19%2F22632172%2Flarge-battery-power-capacity-us-grew-2020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;largest solar farm in the US&lt;/a&gt; has a capacity of 579MW and can generate enough electricity for about 255,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao0swK"&gt;That’s all good news for renewable energy, but way more batteries are needed to clean up the electricity grid. “It’s great that it’s growing. But by the scale of the grid, it’s still a pretty small drop in the bucket,” says Gerbrand Ceder, a professor of materials science and engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. For perspective, Ceder says, the total battery power capacity in the US at the end of 2020 is still “no bigger than one or two big power plants.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="u4dA3T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Still a pretty small drop in the bucket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYIFEK"&gt;Batteries store renewable energy so it can be used when winds lull and sunlight dims. They’re also a clean &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KQEt5QqPXU"&gt;alternative to fossil-fueled “peaker plants”&lt;/a&gt; that come online periodically to provide extra juice when there’s high demand. Big batteries can also step in when a disaster knocks another power source offline. So on top of cutting down greenhouse gas emissions, they can make the grid more reliable and resilient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYDsrm"&gt;Electricity is currently responsible for a quarter of &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;greenhouse gas emissions in the US&lt;/a&gt;. But a clean grid could tackle emissions from other sectors like transportation and heating as cars, homes, and buildings go all-electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e868RZ"&gt;The Biden administration has set a target of making the power sector “carbon pollution-free” by 2035, in an effort to slow down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;already catastrophic effects&lt;/a&gt; of climate change. That can be achieved by turning to renewable energy sources like wind and solar. Or the goal could potentially be met through a combination of renewables plus more controversial carbon-free energy from nuclear plants and fossil-fueled power plants paired with technology that captures carbon dioxide from their emissions. But with concerns about the cost, safety, and pollution from nuclear energy and carbon capture strategies, many environmental advocates hope batteries can ensure that there’s a bigger proportion of renewable energy feeding the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="10g4JL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPbtt7"&gt;Battery storage costs have tumbled 72 percent since 2015, the EIA found, which helps explain why the vast majority of large-scale battery storage power capacity available today only came online within the past six years. Electric vehicles have helped drive down lithium-ion battery costs in the power sector, according to Ceder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcJ5mf"&gt;As costs fall, battery power capacity is forecast to grow quickly in the coming years. There’s 10,000MW of large-scale battery storage on the way from now until 2023, according to what utilities have reported to the EIA. That’s ten times the capacity there was in 2019, and most of it will be paired with solar power generators.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New test brings Reels to Facebook in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vw7IIBu85S66RPrxpBN4NAYlab8=/1x0:2047x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747533/facebookreels.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FaJ78t"&gt;Facebook in the US is going to look slightly more like TikTok for some users. Today, the company announced that it’s testing Facebook Reels stateside, which will bring the short-form, TikTok-like videos to the platform. These will show up for some users in the News Feed and within Groups, where people can watch them together. (The company is already testing this in India, Mexico, and Canada, and the US limited rollout is just an extension of that test.) As part of this test, Instagram users will also be able to cross-post their reels to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQPzK6"&gt;People can watch and create reels from the Facebook app, and the feature is designed to give people a way to “express themselves, discover entertaining content, and to help creators broaden their reach.” As justification for the test, Facebook says nearly half of time spent on the app is dedicated to watching videos, and that Reels is growing “especially quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG05R4"&gt;Of course, the remaining question is whether people will dedicate time to making this type of content, specifically for Facebook. Facebook’s competitors, like Snapchat, have paid people to do so, with Snap at one point spending $1 million per day to incentivize creation for its Spotlight feature. YouTube also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its Shorts Fund, which will see the company pay out $100 million throughout the next year to creators who make content for its TikTok competitor. Facebook has said it’ll spend $1 billion on Facebook and Instagram creators through 2022, but adds today that it’ll also “roll out additional bonus programs and seed funding” in the coming months, particularly aimed at Facebook Reels. If anything can get people to make content, it’s the promise of a potentially big payout. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bird’s new electric bike looks like a VanMoof, and you can buy it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOa7dvbK3ONJOkWD_U_R-7_CzgQ=/0x1:2468x1646/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747472/Bird_Bike_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pL41Q1"&gt;Shared electric scooter company Bird is branching out into new two-wheeled vehicles, namely electric bikes. A few months after it introduced its first shared e-bike, the company announced that it would also offer its own e-bike for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="te7Fvp"&gt;The bike, dubbed Bird Bike of course, has a 500W rear hub motor, a Gates carbon belt drive, pedal- and throttle-assisted power, and the relatively modest sticker price of $2,299. Design-wise, the bike looks very similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof’s popular e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;, with a slightly elongated top tube and embedded front and rear lights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P65L1"&gt;Bird, which was the first company to introduce shared electric scooters in a US city, has always flirted with the idea of e-bikes. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20926658/bird-scoot-electric-moped-la-cruiser-specs-speed"&gt;first rolled out its Scoot-branded electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in 2019 but was forced to pause the Cruiser program because of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="952etA"&gt;Last May, the company announced that it was going public by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428864/bird-electric-scooter-spac-public-valuation"&gt;merging with a SPAC called Switchback II&lt;/a&gt;. In its &lt;a href="https://www.bird.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Bird-Investor-Presentation.pdf"&gt;pitch to investors&lt;/a&gt;, the company included an image of a shrouded bicycle next to several graphs charting the meteoric rise in e-bike sales in the US. “Coming soon,” the graphic promised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CpkEsX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the Bird Bike looks to be a more powerful option compared to the shared e-bikes the company plans on rolling out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2FCZSw"&gt;Based on the spec list, the Bird Bike looks to be a more powerful option compared to the shared e-bikes the company plans on rolling out to select cities in the US and Europe later this year. The rear-hub motor is made by Bafang and will come in 500W (for the US) and 250W (for Europe) configurations. The 36v / 12.8Ah battery is removable for easy charging and, based on the power setting, should provide up to 50 miles of range. Using pedal assist, the bike can reach a top speed of 20mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PYSDFO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10709218"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNzJ50"&gt;The Gates carbon belt drive, which is quickly becoming a popular choice among bike manufacturers, is a cleaner alternative to the derailleur and chain ring and requires less maintenance. The tires, which are made by Kenda, are puncture resistant. And the bike can be connected to the Bird app via Bluetooth, where customers can turn the lights on or off and see the battery range and miles ridden. (This information is also available on the bike’s LCD panel display on the handlebars.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qHpAX"&gt;The bike comes in two colors, stealth black and gravity gray. It’s also available in a step-over and a step-through frame type. The company says it expects the bike to be “broadly available” this fall in the US and Europe. Bird also is one of the few shared scooter companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448941/bird-air-electric-scooter-announce-price-specs"&gt;sell personally owned scooters as well&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZvI6K"&gt;Bird’s decision to add e-bikes to its product lineup coincides with Lime’s recent moves to expand its own fleet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409409/lime-electric-moped-nyc-price-announce"&gt;such as with the addition of electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt;. While both companies are mostly known for their electric kick scooters, there is a growing sense among micromobility providers that the more varied your vehicle lineup is, the better your chances are at becoming a financially soluble business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL34fX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvJynN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9hf8Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox game The Vale transports you to a medieval world through sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Title screen of The Vale, showing Alex, the player character, holding a sword and shield as she stands in shadow in front of a dark, red-tinted landscape." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyP5O70DhQAHe56jwQ-pAD08wWg=/37x0:3637x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747442/TheVale_Title_Landscape.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Title screen of The Vale: Shadow of the Crown.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Falling Squirrel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kd0Lp6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale: Shadow of the Crown&lt;/em&gt;, an audio-based adventure game by indie studio Falling Squirrel, is available on Xbox and PC today for $19.99. The game was developed in collaboration with the Canadian National Institute for the Blind, and made for and tested by blind and low-vision players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhHICz"&gt;Players navigate a medieval setting as Alex, the blind second heir to a kingdom, who is on her way to the borderlands when her caravan is attacked by enemy soldiers. Left on her own, Alex has to travel the land, find weapons, learn spells, and fight enemies without sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsenFo"&gt;Besides menus, which are presented in text and through audio description, the only visuals in &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;are colored specks that float across a black screen. The behavior of the specks changes based on what’s happening in different scenes; they’ll turn blue and fall during rain or imitate floating embers when Alex comes across a burning village. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSaNq2"&gt;Without visual information, the player has to listen to the sounds of the environment when moving around. The gameplay relies on 3D audio, so headphones are required. You move in the direction of clanging metal to find the smithy, or toward little squeaks and nibbles to find rats to squash in the inn’s basement. During combat, you raise your shield or swing your sword to the right, left, or forward depending on where you hear the enemy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j143yx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ACFQ7WlXF9c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="It10hh"&gt;I played about an hour of &lt;em&gt;The Vale &lt;/em&gt;on PC. I’m not blind, but I found several of the gameplay elements refreshing. I get overwhelmed easily by games that introduce lots of controls up front, so it was nice to have a voice in my ear explaining which buttons to press and when. It was also handy to be able to close my eyes when the rain animation started making me motion sick, something I can’t do in most games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNIeDg"&gt;The voice acting and sound design are lively, serving both as narrative tools and navigational cues. When choosing between side quests, you make your decisions based on vignettes of conversations, rather than reading through walls of text. Certain elements like inventory management and weapon upgrades are simplified in a way that doesn’t sacrifice the game’s RPG feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KFHeJ"&gt;There are a few things that could make &lt;em&gt;The Vale&lt;/em&gt; more accessible, like remappable controls and captions. While it’s made for people with visual impairments, and makes strides in that area, there are players with both low vision and other disabilities who would benefit from those options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSUMss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vale&lt;/em&gt; is hopefully a sign of more blind accessible games to come. Immersive, engaging games that forgo conventional game mechanics mean more variety for all kinds of players. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Netflix engineers charged with insider trading </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hcUPp7-eXP9bX8uN_GfG0ZmH4xE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747389/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Three former Netflix engineers charged with insider trading | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AGg5Yp"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has charged three former Netflix engineers with being part of a “long-running” insider trading scheme, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-158"&gt;the agency announced&lt;/a&gt;. The engineers and two close associates allegedly traded on confidential information about Netflix’s subscriber growth, generating more than $3 million in total profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61hYk4"&gt;According to the SEC complaint, while employed at Netflix in 2016 and 2017, Sung Mo “Jay” Jun tipped information about the streaming giant’s subscribers to his brother Joon Mo Jun and friend Junwoo Chon, who used the info to trade ahead of Netflix earnings announcements. After Sung Mo Jun left Netflix in 2017, the SEC alleges, he continued to get confidential information about the company’s subscriber growth from Ayden Lee, described as “another Netflix insider” and former Netflix colleague Jae Hyeon Bae, another engineer at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0ctB7"&gt;The engineers used encrypted messaging apps to discuss their trading scheme, to evade detection. The SEC said the group’s “improbably successful trading over time” was eventually flagged by its Market Abuse Unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P6iYnx"&gt;During 2016 and 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394425/netflix-subscriber-growth-stalls-2021"&gt;Netflix saw rapid growth&lt;/a&gt;, as its stock price more than tripled. It was adding an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21142065/netflix-streaming-wars-subscriber-growth-disney-international"&gt;average of 5 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; a year between 2012 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJJ6lS"&gt;Giving employees access to company information that may be considered sensitive is part of Netflix founder Reed Hastings’ philosophy, as &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/three-former-netflix-software-engineers-charged-insider-trading-sec-1234817441/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;. In his 2020 book &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/netflix-reed-hastings-book-five-takeaways-no-rules-rules-1234752550/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Rules Rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Hastings said sharing such details was a motivational tool for workers. “We are perhaps the only public company that shares financial results internally in the weeks before the quarter is closed,” Hastings wrote in the book. “The financial world sees this as reckless. But the information has never been leaked. When it does one day leak (I imagine it will), we won’t overreact. We’ll just deal with that one case and continue with transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZEPzs"&gt;Netflix didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9rASgG"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GZNzCG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartwatch-induced health anxiety led one woman to run 916 ECGs in a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zgqnMuAwsetL7U_xjHbURCIfEps=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69747269/acastro_190219_1777_watch_health_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uno6Cg"&gt;One year after getting diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, a heart condition that causes an irregular heartbeat, a 70-year-old woman was back for another diagnosis: new-onset health anxiety triggered by her smartwatch. Despite not having concerning symptoms, the patient became more and more preoccupied with and worried about notifications from her watch. Over the one-year period, she took 916 ECG recordings through her device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmMqlq"&gt;That patient isn’t an outlier, says Lindsey Rosman, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of cardiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, who wrote about the case in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8357265/pdf/nihms-1705938.pdf"&gt;new paper&lt;/a&gt;. She was just one example of a pattern seen in cardiology clinics. “Patients with underlying arrhythmias, heart palpitations, or irregular heartbeats were coming into clinic with literally stacks of papers with data from their smartwatches,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1Oo6Y"&gt;Smartwatches are a great tool in cardiology — they help doctors educate patients, can be great tools for patient engagement, and give researchers access to big-picture data on health trends. But for some patients, they can cause more harm than good. “Wearables are amazing,” Rosman says. “At the same time, they may have an unintended effect for some patients where they create and perpetuate that anxiety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uwcpli"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they may have an unintended effect for some patients where they create and perpetuate that anxiety”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x329QV"&gt;Some of the problem likely comes from the constant access to on-demand health information. “It can create this pattern of pathologic symptom monitoring,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji2UiL"&gt;Rosman and her colleagues also noticed that many patients were upset by innocuous readings — like elevated heart rate notifications from exercise — or when the wearables said that a reading was inconclusive or inconsistent. Those results were misinterpreted as a potential danger, and pushed them to use the device more and more frequently. That’s what happened with the 70-year-old patient: her ECG usage escalated anytime she got a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWh4Ty"&gt;The sheer volume of information produced when patients are constantly checking their heart rhythm can be hard for doctors to manage — there’s only so much time in a regular patient visit, and it’s not enough to get through dozens of heart rhythm readings. It can also strain the relationships between doctors and patients: patients might feel like they’re having a problem, but their doctor may not see a need to change their treatment. “There’d be a discrepancy between what patients and families are experiencing and think is dangerous, and what the healthcare providers are doing,” Rosman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krUOsm"&gt;There’s a chance this type of anxiety&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;may appear with other types of health data gathered on smartwatches, not just heart rate data. People might fixate on breathing rate or blood oxygen level information because of the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, Rosman says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcaGCf"&gt;It’s not clear yet what proportion of patients might experience this type of anxiety, or what risk factors might make someone more likely to experience it. Those are questions Rosman hopes to answer going forward — she’d like to get a better picture of how this type of anxiety affects patient’s health and quality of life, and if those patterns push people to seek out unnecessary medical care. The 70-year-old patient is only one example, but in that case, she saw a healthcare provider 12 times over the year, even though she didn’t have any physical symptoms that would prompt a visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rfbzK"&gt;The chance that someone might develop health anxiety while using a wearable doesn’t detract from their potential benefits. But it’s an issue that doctors, tech companies, and other stakeholders should consider, Rosman says. The groups should work together to develop better patient education information around how people should use the device and how they should interpret that data. Right now, information around health data from tech companies tends to be complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akpeq0"&gt;“We need to have something at more of a fifth grade reading level,” Rosman says — that’s typically the target for patient education materials, she says. It should be in a variety of different formats, as well, like in an auditory form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qyN94"&gt;“It’s a large task, but a reasonable task,” she says. “I think if we’re going to create the technology, we need to create the patient information so that they can understand and use it effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkOpdH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steve Jobs email confirms Apple was working on an ‘iPhone nano’ </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zEvBRi"&gt;In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/81768/more-detail-on-apples-iphone-nano-exclusive/"&gt;rumors swirled&lt;/a&gt; that Apple was working on a so-called “iPhone nano,” a new iPhone that would be smaller and cheaper than the top-of-the-line model at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-06-22-iphone-4-review.html"&gt;the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;. While Apple never did release that rumored super-small phone, a Steve Jobs email we spotted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"&gt;while collecting the very best emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; confirms the company was indeed working on an iPhone nano at one point in time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Py0fBN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22375277"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oZ53Yd"&gt;Unfortunately, Jobs’ October 2010 email, which is an agenda for a strategy meeting, doesn’t reveal much about the device. There’s a bullet for an “iPhone nano plan,” a sub-bullet for its “cost goal,” and another sub-bullet indicating that “Jony,” presumably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761736/jony-ive-apple-leave-iphone-chief-design-officer-lovefrom-company-quit"&gt;Apple’s former design chief Jony Ive&lt;/a&gt;, would “show model (and/or renderings).” A “2011 Strategy” bullet earlier in the agenda has a sub-bullet that says “create low cost iPhone model based on iPod touch to replace 3GS,” but it’s unclear if that is referring to the iPhone nano or a different device entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NAVSuS"&gt;While Apple doesn’t use the “nano” branding for any of its physically smaller products right now, Apple had just released its &lt;em&gt;sixth&lt;/em&gt; iteration of the hugely popular iPod nano when Jobs sent this email, so the branding still carried some power at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3tqIT"&gt;The iPhone nano actually isn’t the first mysterious “nano” Apple product that has appeared in a meeting agenda sent by Steve Jobs found as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial. An August 5th, 2007 Jobs email shared by the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400208754659008519"&gt;Internal Tech Emails Twitter account&lt;/a&gt; refers to a “Super nano,” which seems likely to have been an upgraded version of the iPod nano, that was on track for a release in the first half of 2008. Apple didn’t end up releasing an iPod nano in that timeframe, and although it did release the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-09-09-official-ipod-nano-reaches-4g-looks-tall-for-its-age.html"&gt;tall fourth-generation iPod nano&lt;/a&gt; in September 2008, we don’t know if this was the “Super nano” to which Jobs was referring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w3bC03"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Steve Jobs: Apple executive team meeting agenda&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;August 5, 2007 &lt;a href="https://t.co/m9H9PWFIbG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/m9H9PWFIbG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Internal Tech Emails (@TechEmails) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400208754659008519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wZzUZH"&gt;Apple has moved on from the nano branding, eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/7/27/16051744/ipod-nano-history"&gt;discontinuing the iPod nano in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and opted instead for the “Mini” moniker for the currently available &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 12 Mini&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod Mini&lt;/a&gt;. Still, it’s fun to imagine what an extra small iPhone nano may have looked like, especially in 2010 / 2011, when the iPhone 4 had a now-tiny 3.5-inch screen. Maybe if Apple &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; introduced the iPhone nano, Jobs could have pulled off &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GRv-kv5XEg"&gt;one of his most famous reveal tricks&lt;/a&gt; a second time.&lt;/p&gt;
