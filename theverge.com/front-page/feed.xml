    <title>The next step for wearables could be illness ‘warning lights’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch OS 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fXh2zueaFAkTFGlY605oKWtNPXQ=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456509/20150914-apple-watch-os-2-os2-14.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q7JE9o"&gt;Harpreet Rai, the CEO of smart ring company Oura, often &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/23/oura-ceo-harpreet-rai-our-smart-ring-users-found-coronavirus-detection.html"&gt;tells a story&lt;/a&gt; about a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ouraring/status/1239580766427697152"&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; Facebook post. An Oura ring user posted that the device said that his overall health score had dropped below his normal level, which prompted him to get tested for COVID-19 — and the test ended up being positive. The company heard from other users, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCzNCm"&gt;The anecdotal reports encouraged Oura to partner with research teams to try to figure out how well the ring could predict who might be sick with COVID-19. Their studies were part of a wave of interest over the past year in wearable devices as illness detectors. Now, flush with data, researchers and wearable companies are looking toward their next steps.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sFXzq"&gt;Research done over the past year showed that it’s probably possible to flag when someone is sick. But differentiating &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; illness someone might have will be much harder. Experts think it might eventually be possible, but in the near future, illness detection programs might look more like warning lights: they could tell a user that they might be getting sick, but just not with what. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="txKcx2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just like the warning light for your car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlaXXp"&gt;“It’s just like the warning light for your car — take it into the mechanic, we don’t know what’s wrong, but something looks off,” Rai says. “I think that’s where the industry is heading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Q1YshH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illness signatures &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1jP44H"&gt;Even before the pandemic, researchers were checking wearables’ data to see if they could find telltale signatures that might predict illnesses. One study published in &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500%2819%2930222-5/fulltext#seccestitle150"&gt;early 2020&lt;/a&gt; found that data from Fitbits could predict state-level trends in flu-like illnesses, for example. Other research found that wearable devices could detect signs of &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402"&gt;Lyme disease&lt;/a&gt;. A research team at Mount Sinai Health System in New York used wearables to predict disease flare-ups in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) like Crohn’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ePtij"&gt;When COVID-19 hit, many of those research teams adjusted their focus. “We decided to shift some of our emphasis to how we can evaluate and identify COVID-19 infections, using the same techniques and technology,” says Robert Hirten, a gastroenterologist at Mount Sinai who worked on wearables and IBD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlzuYo"&gt;Hirten’s research showed that Apple Watches could detect changes in the heart rate variability of healthcare workers &lt;a href="https://www.mountsinai.org/about/newsroom/2021/mount-sinai-study-finds-wearable-devices-can-detect-covid19-symptoms-and-predict-diagnosis-pr"&gt;up to seven days&lt;/a&gt; before they were diagnosed with COVID-19. Heart rate variability, which tracks the time between heartbeats, is a good proxy for how the nervous system is working, he says. “Often it seems to be very telling of something going on in the body, even before people realize something is happening.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftAlru"&gt;Other types of data were also useful. A Stanford University study found that heart rate, daily steps, and time asleep as measured by smartwatches &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00640-6"&gt;changed in a small group of users&lt;/a&gt; before they developed symptoms of COVID-19. The &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-78355-6#Sec11"&gt;first report&lt;/a&gt; from the TemPredict study at the University of California, San Francisco found that the Oura ring could detect increases in body temperature before wearers developed COVID-19 symptoms. Through a partnership with New York-based Northwell Health, Fitbit &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00363-7#Sec6"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that its devices tracked changes in heart rate and breathing rate in the days before someone started feeling sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1hH7b"&gt;The research is ongoing. Groups at UCSF and the West Virginia University Rockefeller Neuroscience Institute continue to run studies with Oura ring, and Fitbit is still working on research with Northwell Health. Fitbit is also part of &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/covid-19-study/"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; out of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and the Stanford Medicine Healthcare Innovation Lab. Apple launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/can-digital-devices-help-detect-flu-covid-19-infection"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; on respiratory disease prediction and Apple Watch in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kJ1N3S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are really learning better ways to identify and predict conditions.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="70OXCR"&gt;The big wearable companies have a good reason to pursue this line of research; the studies done so far are promising. “People are really learning better ways to identify and predict conditions,” Hirten says. “This has really taken the field of wearable technologies forward significantly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NmDC7E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A warning light &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fTdqyP"&gt;That doesn’t mean that smartwatches will have apps that tell wearers when they have COVID-19. There’s a big difference between being able to detect a general change in the body that could be an illness and detecting a &lt;em&gt;specific&lt;/em&gt; illness, says Jennifer Radin, an epidemiologist with the digital medicine division at Scripps Research Translational Institute who’s run studies on wearables and COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnsuIO"&gt;“If your heart rate goes up compared to your normal rate, it can be caused by many other things besides just a viral infection. It could just be that you had too many drinks last night,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="am63TU"&gt;None of the metrics researchers pull from wearables are direct measures of a respiratory illness. “They’re all just markers of if the body is feeling good or not,” Hirten says. The systems are very different from the features on wearable devices that can detect atrial fibrillation, a type of abnormal heart rhythm. In that case, the wearable is directly measuring the marker — heart rate — that changes in a clear, unique way when someone experiences atrial fibrillation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bvWXkG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something like COVID-19 is much more complicated.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5pbIBY"&gt;“Something like COVID-19 is much more complicated. You’re trying to look for alternative markers in the body that track viral illness,” he says. “But it’s a lot more complicated because those markers also track other things going on in the body.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pt1xJ4"&gt;Fitbit saw the overlap with other illnesses on one of its illness prediction projects &lt;a href="https://blog.fitbit.com/covid-19-study/"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;, which asked participants to take flu tests. There were similar signals in the data when people had the flu as when they had COVID-19, said Conor Heneghan, a director of research at Fitbit. “My instinct is that it’s going to be hard to reliably distinguish between them,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tuHNe"&gt;The task gets even harder as the levels of coronavirus circulating in a community drops. The studies done on wearables and COVID-19 all ran over the past year when the coronavirus was the primary thing making people sick. Flu season &lt;a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-ended-flu-season-before-it-started/"&gt;hardly existed&lt;/a&gt;. There was a pretty good chance that, if someone had a certain signature on their wearable that tracked with respiratory illness, the respiratory illness could be COVID-19. As the disease becomes rare, that gets harder. “It’s not as specific anymore as the prevalence drops,” Hirten says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ujm3OU"&gt;But tools to alert people when they might be getting sick are still useful, even if they can’t say what someone is sick &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt;. Heneghan says that’s the likeliest path forward for Fitbit. “It’ll be a general, hey, something has changed in your physiological signs, you might want to consider that you could be getting ill,” he says. “That’s probably ok from our point of view.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnFD3n"&gt;Oura’s Rai says that the Oura ring serves that function already. The ring gives users a readiness score, which incorporates metrics like sleep quality, heart rate, and body temperature. If it detects that someone’s body temperature is elevated, it gives people the option to pause activity goals and enter a rest mode. That’s the product’s warning light, Rai says. He thinks it’ll be the main approach for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGrf3Z"&gt;“These devices cannot diagnose or treat, but what they can do is say that something’s off in your baseline,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zehIs8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What they can do is say that something’s off in your baseline”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hHdJN6"&gt;Adding those types of features to more wearable devices will take good communication with users, says Radin. “We don’t want to scare people,” she says. It’d be a problem if people who wore smartwatches thought they had COVID-19 any time their data changed. But the devices could explain to users that there is a range of reasons someone might be seeing a change, including illness, she says. “It’s just a heads up that something is out of your normal range, and it could be something to keep an eye on.”  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds E2E RCS encryption to Messages, emoji mashup suggests, and more for Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A drawing of a person using starred messages to save a text containing a Wi-Fi password" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qQwrYIa_TOIBdUjdUJnryPT7GoM=/250x0:1600x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455668/Untitled_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W7balv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-features-summer-2021"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; seven new features for Android that it says will help improve accessibility and make Assistant Shortcuts more useful, among other things. The new features announced today are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qRcwNg"&gt;End-to-end encryption for Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JwXfkB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.android.com/google-features-on-android/summer-2021/#summer-2021-end-to-end-contents"&gt;Google announced&lt;/a&gt; that RCS chats sent through the Messages app will now be end-to-end encrypted. The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;rolled out in beta last November&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems that Google is now releasing it for everyone who has access to RCS. When a message will be encrypted, the send button will have a lock icon on it — that’ll be important to keep an eye out for, as many people you text may not have RCS, or may not be using messages. It’s also worth noting that, according to Google, the feature will only be available for one-on-one conversations, so your group chats won’t be getting the feature at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zJ6ie9"&gt;Android’s Earthquake Alerts are coming to more countries&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xvio6R"&gt;Google says its phone-based earthquake detection and alert system will be coming to Turkey, the Philippines, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The system, which uses Android phones to create an earthquake detection network that will warn people if they’re in a potentially affected area, originally launched in California, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407676/google-expands-android-earthquake-detection-system"&gt;was made available&lt;/a&gt; in Greece and New Zealand in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLLUeT"&gt;Google says it hopes to bring the feature to more regions over the next year, but that it’s focusing on first making it available to countries that have a high risk of earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="EnYDvt"&gt;Starred Messages&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="JyxsmQ"&gt;If you get sent a text with important info and want to be able to quickly find it, you’ll be able to “star” it, which will place it in the starred category so you won’t have to scroll back through a conversation to find it. Google says the feature will be rolling out to the Messages app “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cpWpNWN8IprNefP67JmbAjvICgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659095/Emoji_kitchen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gboard will suggest your custom emoji creations based on your message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RtEWOV"&gt;Emoji Kitchen recommendations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TrUzI3"&gt;Starting this summer, Gboard will contextually suggest stickers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21132971/google-emoji-mashups-kitchen-gboard-android-cowboy-monkey-ghost-combination"&gt;created in Emoji Kitchen&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s tool that lets users create mashups of two different emoji. The suggestions will show up in the Emoji menu for those writing a message in English, Spanish, or Portuguese. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ji2QTgR5GKHtPRR4g9-mnpmV-ck=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659110/Screen_Shot_2021_05_17_at_4.05.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/new-for-io-assistant-tools-and-features.html" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google uses Strava as an example for the widget view that will be available in Assistant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XTxYQY"&gt;Google Assistant Shortcuts are getting an upgrade&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="feUePm"&gt;Google’s Assistant Shortcuts let users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506301/google-assistant-custom-shortcuts-third-party-apps-android"&gt;jump to a specific part of an app&lt;/a&gt;, but developers will now be able to show users information in widget form right in Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utYBHxHA0d7Hawgd-9BSKkCn0PU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659138/voice_access_gaze_detect.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tell Voice Input to ignore you if you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="XVqiVw"&gt;Voice Access won’t take your conversations as input&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaF2b4"&gt;Google’s Voice Access app, which allows people to navigate their phones using their voice, is getting gaze detection so it can tell whether someone is talking to their phone or talking to other people. The feature, which is in beta, will stop taking commands if it detects that you’re not looking at your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIvJ40"&gt;Voice Access is also getting improvements when it comes to entering passwords: users will be able to say words like “dollar sign,” and they’ll be translated into the symbol, instead of being written out literally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oHQRDw"&gt;Android Auto gets more customization and creature comforts &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUCnY"&gt;Android Auto users will be able to use their phone to personalize the app launcher and manually manage dark mode. Google’s also adding the ability to quickly scroll to the top of a list, and the scroll bar is getting an A to Z button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66EYoR"&gt;Google also says the messaging experience for apps like Messages and WhatsApp has been improved, making it easier to send and read messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ONOK0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 15th, 2:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with information about Google adding end-to-end encryption for RCS chats sent through Messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Switch is getting new Mario Party and WarioWare games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMFKHQDqGBo1VdghD6QIcEgDLGA=/169x0:1089x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456280/mpss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7L3S"&gt;During its E3 Direct, Nintendo announced new entries in the &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; series, both coming to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0eY92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will be a collection of classic &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; boards from the Nintendo 64, featuring (hopefully only the most infuriating) mini-games from both the N64 and GameCube eras. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-party-superstars-switch/"&gt;According to Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, the mini-games can be played through online multiplayer and are compatible with regular controllers (unlike the recent &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-party/"&gt;didn’t allow for the use&lt;/a&gt; of a Pro Controller or Switch Lite unless you had external Joy-Cons.) It will release on October 29th, 2021, for $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVmeVR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Erdq0kiako4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p0YLA4"&gt;Nintendo also announced a new &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; game called &lt;em&gt;Get It Together.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/warioware-get-it-together-switch/"&gt;Nintendo says&lt;/a&gt; it will feature over 200 tiny games, along with a story mode, which can be played alone or with a friend on the same system, or via local wireless co-op. &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; will release on September 10th, 2021, and will sell for $50. You can watch the trailer below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NReGb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxk6ijyr5Wk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>eBay’s sex ban wipes out an important storefront for queer collectors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a phone showing the eBay logo, set on top of a laptop keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oi0Hh0g4H4vFMBfItL94NXOvcjE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456257/1229865757.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQrWfq"&gt;Carta Monir, an author, publisher, and pornographer, maintains an amateur archive of vintage queer erotica: zines, comics, porn mags, classified ads, and other ephemera. “I think it’s really valuable to preserve and read these artifacts,” she says, “like people speaking to you from the perspective of the way that their community was at the time.” One of her favorite marketplaces for finding these materials is eBay, where she can consistently find a variety of old erotica for fairly cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYvaRB"&gt;But starting today, Monir’s access to these materials is significantly reduced. eBay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436855/ebay-sex-ban-june-15"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt; that it would be removing the “Adult Only” category on June 15th. Under &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fpolicies%2Fprohibited-restricted-items%2Frestricted-adult-items-policy%3Fid%3D4278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22535109%2Febay-sex-ban-adult-only-queer-collectors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new policy&lt;/a&gt;, sellers aren’t allowed to list “items containing nudity and displays of sexual activitys” on the site. The policy makes exceptions for a few mainstream titles, including &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Playgirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mayfair&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Penthouse&lt;/em&gt;, as long as the listing doesn’t contain nude images. eBay has already expanded that list to include several gay and lesbian magazines, including &lt;em&gt;Playguy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On Our Backs&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BUTT&lt;/em&gt;. But by and large, the policy has the effect of wiping out pornography from one of the internet’s biggest storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9S2PF"&gt;The new rules at eBay echo policy changes over the years at other sites, including Tumblr and Patreon, which have banned or limited adult content. According to Monir and others, those policies tend to have the harshest impacts on queer communities and especially queer people who produce or buy erotic content outside of mainstream porn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Exu5ku"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The “Adult Only” section is already hard to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cjkI"&gt;eBay says its goal is to make adult items available to people “while preventing those who do not wish to view or purchase these items from easily accessing them.” But it’s already difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally stumble on the “Adult Only” section of eBay. It doesn’t appear in drop-down menus and is nested several categories deep. Users have to sign in, agree to continue, and enter a credit card to view it. eBay did not respond to a request for comment on the new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTF0SY"&gt;Adult content bans usually aren’t decisions made entirely by sites themselves and are instead responses to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/4/18126112/tumblr-porn-ban-verizon-ad-goals-sex-work-fandom"&gt;advertising concerns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;strict regulations&lt;/a&gt; from payment processors and credit card companies. In turn, those regulations are often influenced by lobbying from conservatives who point to sex trafficking and “save the children” arguments to cut down on porn. “There are undisguised evangelical anti-porn groups working extremely hard to ban pornography outright, and especially queer pornography,” says Monir, citing organizations like &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxqy4z/petition-shut-down-pornhub-trafficking-hub-earn-it"&gt;Exodus Cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing a section of eBay titled “Adult-Only Items” with subcategories for books, magazine back issues, DVDs, art, collectibles, and other items." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHwF14dwTByR0zu_bUuR2-os7p0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.15.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: eBay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBay’s adult-only storefront.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IDCyWj"&gt;These bans aren’t just bad for collectors, but for artists. In 2008, eBay was one of the first places where Jade, a queer artist, managed to sell their erotic artwork. For several years before they started a webcomic, they would list smutty ink drawings on the site where people would buy them up within a few days. At the time, they remember thinking, “Wow, this is great, you can do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekC0xI"&gt;But things have been more fraught in the years since then. Jade still sells their work on other sites, but always with the worry that their livelihood will disappear if payment processors and credit card companies place further restrictions on the sale of erotica and porn. Patreon increased the enforcement of its adult content regulations in 2018 because of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;pressure from payment partners&lt;/a&gt;, including PayPal, which is known to close people’s accounts and withhold the money in them. Jade requested a pseudonym for this article out of fear that PayPal would shut down their account because of its strict “sexually oriented goods” policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Gubz"&gt;Megan Gedris, another queer artist who makes erotic comics, has also felt the effects of adult content restrictions. Since Tumblr’s 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;adult content ban&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve found it much harder to grow and maintain an audience for their work. They have two separate Patreon pages, one designated 18+ and one that’s not, because Patreon limits the exposure of 18+ accounts, and they worry mixing the two would make all of their work harder to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8zFCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjbOHk"&gt;Policies like the ones at eBay, Patreon, and Tumblr only compound the effects of FOSTA-SESTA, which were ostensibly passed to curb online sex trafficking but have mostly hurt &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom"&gt;sex workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17360458/anti-sex-trafficking-law-fosta-sex-work-education-oschool"&gt;sex educators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/i-fear-loss-community-tumblr-s-new-adult-content-rules-n944196"&gt;queer communities&lt;/a&gt;, and erotic artists. “We know that the way that bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression,” Monir says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGypjS"&gt;Gedris says crackdowns on adult content end up affecting indie creators the most, and it’s those creators who make erotic work that features disabled, fat, non-white, queer, and trans people. It’s important for people who rarely see bodies like theirs in mainstream porn to have access to erotic work that reflects their bodies and experiences. Jade says there’s been a boom of “amazing, beautiful queer erotica” in recent years, but there are still only a handful of publishers that will distribute it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcOoVD"&gt;There are other sites where Monir can dig around for her collection, but she says nothing compares to eBay. “It’s very frustrating because it effectively destroys one of the only reasonably priced large, eclectic marketplaces for vintage and archival content,” she says, “and drives that stuff into more specialized underground, expensive, less accessible venues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y0rdm"&gt;Monir sees queer erotica not just as an important form of expression, but as a way to connect with queer people through history. Porn bans don’t come as a surprise, but the change at eBay hits particularly hard. “Seeing this stuff, feeling the passion and personal attention that was paid to it, and feeling the sense of community that comes from it, is very special,” she says. “And I am sad that people’s ability to just stumble onto stuff like this is going to be so much more curtailed and limited with this large marketplace going away.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt says Cyberpunk 2077 will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNJOyNFFhZMC4mUl-NBHIm8Io8g=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456142/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tgNaCU"&gt;CD Projekt says &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st, slightly more than six months after being removed. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22229742/cyberpunk-2077-returns-to-playstation-store-release-refund-ps4-ps5-cd-projekt-red"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the news came in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-34-2021/"&gt;regulatory disclosure&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s developer, CD Projekt Red’s parent company, saying Sony had agreed to reinstate the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijvrbT"&gt;A CD Projekt Red spokesperson declined further comment about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s return, including what potential bug fixes or other updates the new version offers. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;, Sony confirmed the news but said that it still doesn’t recommend playing the game on PlayStation 4. “Users will continue to experience performance issues with the PS4 edition while CD Projekt Red continues to improve stability across all platforms. [Sony Interactive Entertainment] recommends playing the title on PS4 Pro or PS5 for the best experience,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PJgpy"&gt;CD Projekt executives have said they frequently updated Sony on fixes for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s myriad bugs and performance issues since the game was pulled from the store on December 17th, 2020. The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; for its console, PC, and Google Stadia editions; in late May, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cd-projekt-says-its-still-waiting-for-sonys-approval-to-bring-cyberpunk-back-to-the-playstation-store/"&gt;joint CEO Adam Kiciński told investors&lt;/a&gt; there’d been “visible progress” on stabilizing the game. But Kiciński said Sony would have to make the final call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Juyp0j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; was released in December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397638/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-biggest-game-ever-sales"&gt;to strong sales&lt;/a&gt; but severe technical problems. The game struggled to run on last-generation Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, and players faced numerous (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;frequently hilarious&lt;/a&gt;) bugs on every platform. Microsoft and Sony both offered refunds for the game, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189918/cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-store-listing-warning-label"&gt;added a warning label&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox One owners on its Xbox store. Sony took the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;more drastic step&lt;/a&gt; of pulling &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from its PlayStation Store entirely. Console owners could still buy physical discs, but CD Projekt has said that the digital version’s absence may have &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-playstation-store-removal-may-be-hurting-xbox-and-pc-sales-too-cd-projekt-says/"&gt;slowed down sales&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox and PC as well as PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GnmYp"&gt;CD Projekt Red spent nearly a decade designing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cd-projekt-committed-fixing-cyberpunk-2077-so-it-can-sell-for-years-2021-04-12/"&gt;calls the game&lt;/a&gt; a long-term investment that it can sell for “years to come.” The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-reconsidering-cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-102937559.html"&gt;backed away from plans&lt;/a&gt; for a standalone multiplayer mode, saying it would focus on adding online features to all its games instead. But it’s promised downloadable content for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s single-player campaign, plus a major upgrade for new consoles — including the PlayStation 5 — in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSP2S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 15th, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added comment from Sony via&lt;/em&gt; Polygon &lt;em&gt;and response from CD Projekt Red.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is releasing a Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lFHH_NSHqTbcqmMmfXs8r1BcKPo=/0x0:2139x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456064/tlozgameandwatch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DA68Su"&gt;For the 35th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo is releasing a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-themed green and gold Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld console with four playable built-in games. You’ll be able to play the first entry in &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series, followed by its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. The fourth game is the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Vermin &lt;/em&gt;game, but with Link’s character imposed over the original character. Additionally, it can be used as a digital clock or timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHeakW"&gt;The handheld will release on November 12th for $49.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430625/game-and-watch-nintendo-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-handheld-console-closer-look"&gt;The previous Game &amp;amp; Watch console&lt;/a&gt; released for Mario’s 35th anniversary had three games, including the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Ball &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mv8f-6fNrGcCkofPoEi2MyIwCOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660319/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FwGyEY"&gt;This version has a similar design and color LCD display found in the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; version, but it’s unique in that it has a start and select button for navigating the &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;games. Unless Nintendo changed its strategy, it likely has a USB-C charging port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz7a08"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this harrowing story about the team cleaning up Airbnb’s biggest disasters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pVVJW2uDMOjLcrSXRs4To8ksR8Q=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456024/Airbnb_Logo_Over_Gradient.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgO5L7"&gt;When Airbnb works smoothly, the platform can feel like simply an eclectic hotel chain. But the app is a huge, high-stakes experiment in trusting strangers, and that can come with a heavy price. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-15/airbnb-spends-millions-making-nightmares-at-live-anywhere-rentals-go-away"&gt;An article from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;journalist Olivia Carville&lt;/a&gt; makes that price vividly clear, delving into the workings of Airbnb’s safety team — the group that cleans up after Airbnb users’ most horrific experiences, including sexual assaults and murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFpXdl"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article cites interviews with current and former Airbnb employees, who describe an intensely stressful balance of helping customers and protecting Airbnb’s public image. It reports that Airbnb spends around $50 million annually in payouts to hosts and guests. Airbnb says most of that money covers property damage claims, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it also covers cases like a $7 million settlement with a woman who rented a New York apartment and was raped by a stranger who had a set of duplicate keys. After the incident in New York, Airbnb’s now-former crisis management head says he pushed it to ban hosts from leaving keys at local shops — but that he was allegedly overruled in part because it could discourage hosts from continuing to use the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3XAPE"&gt;The story notes that conventional hotels aren’t immune to crime. But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says that Airbnb has unique issues. It’s harder to implement centralized rules that could make guests safer, like digital keypads that would have prevented duplicating keys. It generally relies on a vetting system rather than direct on-site security. Even if the system works the vast majority of the time, its scale of 5.6 million listings can add up to a lot of bad experiences for individual users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mJ6VJ"&gt;Meanwhile, Airbnb is fighting long-running regulatory battles that &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests encourages it to sweep problems under the rug, offering payouts for users’ silence. (Airbnb denied that suggestion in a comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.) “The only thing that really motivates them is the threat or potential threat of bad PR or a nightmare in the press,” complains the lawyer of one person whose son was killed in a shooting at an Airbnb rental. Once an initial crisis is over, “they don’t care anymore, because the news cycle has moved on.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is remastering the first two Advance Wars games for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6OX9pbiQ_h1zw7RWRcA6UkVg2c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456010/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_9.47.45_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2klMm"&gt;Nintendo announced that it’s remastering the first two games in the &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; series for Nintendo Switch in one package under the banner &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&lt;/em&gt;. The game is scheduled to launch on December 3rd, and you can preorder it beginning Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjE3lo"&gt;The games are “fully rebuilt from the ground up,” and in the trailer shown during the presentation, you can see the game’s great new 3D graphics. But it also looks like the classic grid-based strategy gameplay is intact almost exactly as you might remember. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tToU8B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ADVANCE WARS. IS. BACK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaigns return in one package, fully rebuilt from the ground up for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt;! Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp launches 12/3. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7b01QzYGe"&gt;https://t.co/R7b01QzYGe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gcBeVExa8x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gcBeVExa8x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1404840256776683530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="toYtfb"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; game came out in 2001 on the Game Boy Advance, and the second hit in 2003. I played hours and hours of both games as a kid — they were some of the first strategy games I ever enjoyed — so I’m looking forward to getting my hands on these remasters when they’re released for the Switch in December. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Breath of the Wild 2 heads to the skies in stunning E3 trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58sm5uKKT6KOPeGI_OOl7u_ekAM=/0x0:821x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455952/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfCWI3"&gt;After years of anticipation, Nintendo has revealed a new trailer for the still-untitled upcoming sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; at E3 2021, along with a 2022 release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1YUPY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; was a launch title for the Switch, and it reinvented the now-35-year-old franchise with an open-world model that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/17/14957460/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-future-games"&gt;broke new ground in the genre&lt;/a&gt; and is wildly considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;most acclaimed games of all time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0CSoSdQon4l0EOVSEXbSpUBKG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660293/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.38.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b8k8v6"&gt;That’s a long way of saying that there’s a lot riding on the sequel, which Nintendo announced over two years ago at E3 2019 with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00"&gt;surprise teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;. It featured the return of Link and Zelda from &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; along with what appeared to be longtime series villain Ganondorf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cVUP1P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo is working on a full sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="teuA1w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel isn’t Nintendo’s only major Zelda project in the works: the company is also working on an HD rerelease of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which was originally released for the Nintendo Wii, planned for release on July 16th. The &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; port offers improved graphics and a new control scheme to allow players to play the Wii Remote-focused title with a traditional controller.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first three Super Monkey Ball games are getting remastered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccZsVf3gYugQGYBjjEuK9Yjkm28=/26x0:871x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455848/SMBBM_Key_Art___Landscape.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zpRaz"&gt;Sega on Tuesday announced &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, &lt;/em&gt;a “modern HD remaster” of &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;that will be releasing on October 5th for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S, and PC. The announcement arrives ahead of the 20th anniversary of the first game’s original release on June 23rd, 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MpWOd"&gt;The meat of the &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Monkey Ball &lt;/em&gt;series consists of navigating increasingly challenging mazes as adorable monkeys rolling around in transparent balls. But these three games also had some ridiculous multiplayer mini-games that I spent hours on as a kid, such as bowling, billiards, and even golf. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AGOR2tChWloLlyBOK0ywCpyOivw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653931/Mini_Game___Soccer.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sega&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soccer is one of the mini-games you can play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ejEPP"&gt;Sega says &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; will include more than 300 recreated levels and refined versions of the 12 multiplayer mini-games from the original games. Those 12 multiplayer games won’t be playable online, though — they’re four-player local multiplayer only, Sega tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The remaster does have online leaderboards and an online time attack mode, however.&lt;/p&gt;
