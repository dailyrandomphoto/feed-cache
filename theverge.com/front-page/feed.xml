    <title>Toyota is quietly pushing Congress to slow the shift to electric vehicles </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lYMVto"&gt;The US is slowing moving toward adopting policies that would put more electric vehicles on the road, but for Toyota, it’s not slow enough. The Japanese automaker, which is the largest car company in the world, has been quietly lobbying policymakers in Washington, DC to resist the urge to transition to an all-electric future — partly because Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rD2kj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/25/climate/toyota-electric-hydrogen.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a top Toyota executive has met with congressional leaders behind closed doors in recent weeks to advocate against the Biden administration’s plans to spend billions of dollars to incentivize the shift to EVs. The executive, Chris Reynolds, has argued that hybrids, like the Toyota Prius, as well as hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles should also be in the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oY0YDi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota is lagging behind the rest of industry in making that transition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AZQVvz"&gt;In addition, Toyota is also pushing back against EV-friendly policy through the auto industry’s main DC-based lobbying group, the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. The group, which represents the major car companies and their suppliers and is chaired by Reynolds, has been arguing against the Biden administration’s plan to adopt the so-called California compromise as its official position, the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGrQsP"&gt;Last year, a group of car companies made a deal on tailpipe emissions with California, which had been seeking to set tougher rules than the US as a whole. Under President Donald Trump, the Environmental Protection Agency had sought to strip California of its power to set its own emissions standards. But under Biden, that rule was reversed, allowing California and other states to impose tougher standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XrVHeG"&gt;Toyota, which sided with the Trump administration in its battle with California, was not part of the original compromise. And the company has argued against EV-friendly policies in India and in its native country, Japan, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvPuiZ"&gt;Toyota’s behind-the-scene efforts to slow the momentum behind EV-friendly policies is surprising, given its status as an early adopter of battery-powered transportation. With the release of the Toyota Prius in 1997, the company helped pave the way for Tesla and others by proving that vehicles with alternative powertrains could be immensely popular. And more recently, the automaker has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391738/toyota-electric-vehicle-strategy-bz4x-concept-subaru"&gt;revealed plans to release 70 new models by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, including battery-electric, hydrogen fuel cell, and gas-electric hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roCEmu"&gt;But that doesn’t hide the fact that Toyota has fallen far behind its competitors, appearing content to rest on its laurels while the rest of the industry has lapped it several times. Companies like Nissan, General Motors, and Volkswagen have been selling pure battery-electric vehicles for years, while also revealing their plans to phase out gas cars completely. And Toyota’s failure to embrace EVs is not a new concept; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/energy-environment/20electric.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; noted as much in this article from 2009&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oq7ekF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Toyota’s top executives, including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13yhcU"&gt;Toyota’s top executives, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/12/17/toyota-ceo-lack-of-vision-spreads-ev-misinformation-spells-the-end/"&gt;including billionaire CEO Akio Toyoda&lt;/a&gt;, have been on the record calling the trend toward electric vehicles “overhyped” in part because of emissions associated with power plants — which is a favorite talking point used by the oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ves5zT"&gt;The company came under fire recently after it was revealed that it was &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/what-we-learned-from-the-first-major"&gt;the largest corporate donor to Republican lawmakers who objected to the certification of the 2020 presidential election&lt;/a&gt;. A majority of those politicians also dispute the scientific consensus on climate change. Toyota initially defended the contributions, &lt;a href="https://popular.info/p/update-toyota-reverses-course-says"&gt;but then later said it would halt them&lt;/a&gt;. You know things are bad for the company when a Toyota spokesperson has to confirm to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that the automaker does indeed believe that climate change is real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlFTxu"&gt;Toyota’s argument that hybrids and fuel-cell vehicles should also be included in the conversation is not a bad one. Hybrid vehicles in particular are an important stepping stone to the wider adoption of EVs, especially as the charging infrastructure is still in its infancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aEwS7"&gt;But that argument might carry more weight if the automaker’s track record on fuel economy was actually, well, good. &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends/highlights-automotive-trends-report"&gt;According to the EPA&lt;/a&gt;, Toyota has slipped in its ranking in fuel efficiency across its entire fleet, going from an industry leader to near the bottom with GM and Ford. This comes as the company has pushed the sale of huge gas-guzzling trucks and SUVs, which tend to command a larger profit than smaller sedans and hatchbacks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech company anti-terrorism initiative will increase its focus on far-right groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIwehru3lHSDDwTre53AfEJTfTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69633495/akrales_180614_1777_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaagcC"&gt;A cross-platform counterterrorism program will start targeting white supremacist and far-right militia material, flagging content for moderation on Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and several other services. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-facebook-tech-giants-target-manifestos-militias-database-2021-07-26/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported the news&lt;/a&gt; this morning in an interview with Nicholas Rasmussen, executive director of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdqMKe"&gt;GIFCT — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/26/15875102/facebook-microsoft-twitter-youtube-global-internet-forum-counter-terrorism"&gt;launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt; by Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube — maintains a database of terrorist content that helps member companies find it for review or removal. That database initially included material from a United Nations-designated list of sanctioned groups, which meant it focused heavily on Islamist extremist organizations like the Taliban and Islamic State, with exceptions around specific far-right incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;2019 Christchurch, New Zealand shooting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ui1Ze7"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; outlines, GIFCT is expanding the list to include material identified by the UN Tech Against Terrorism initiative and the Five Eyes international intelligence partnership. That means adding content from groups like neo-Nazi organizations, the Three Percenters militia, and the Proud Boys, which was &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/02/992846086/proud-boys-named-terrorist-entity-in-canada"&gt;designated a terrorist entity&lt;/a&gt; by Canada in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IgkIqX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GIFCT’s database helps Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and other platforms flag content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BebqLZ"&gt;The initial GIFCT database included hashed identifiers for images and video, and a spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that GIFCT will add three categories of content over the coming months: PDFs of terrorist or violent extremist attackers, terrorist publications that use specific branding and logos, and URLs that are often shared on social networks. Platforms that can access the database — like Reddit, Snapchat, Microsoft’s LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Dropbox — will use the database to make moderation decisions according to their own policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj6uzl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/gifct-erin-saltman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; offers more detail&lt;/a&gt; on what’s being added, describing the expansion as “modest.” In an interview, GIFCT director of programming Erin Saltman says the group is attempting to avoid “scope creep” and will not include all content from loosely organized groups like &lt;a href="https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2020/05/27/the-boogaloo-movement-is-not-what-you-think/"&gt;the Boogaloo movement&lt;/a&gt; or QAnon — although if a member commits a violent extremist attack, material like a killer’s manifesto might be banned. “There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship, especially when there are such close ties to politics,” says Saltman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dI1mF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of concern of over-censorship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3piFlc"&gt;GIFCT is expanding its list as national governments are taking a closer look at far-right terrorism. The US does not designate domestic terror groups the way it does foreign organizations, but President Joe Biden’s administration has &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/government-and-politics-donald-trump-joe-biden-business-race-and-ethnicity-84a84878e61009485af6b3542bfbb69a"&gt;pushed for a crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on homegrown extremism, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/10/us/politics/three-percenter-capitol-riot.html"&gt;alleged Three Percenters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/19/979304432/4-proud-boys-charged-with-conspiracy-over-jan-6-capitol-riot"&gt;Proud Boys members&lt;/a&gt; were charged with participating in the January 6th riot at the US capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWI2mT"&gt;Saltman notes that companies are wary of GIFCT going beyond existing lists of terrorist groups out of fear it could undermine the credibility of the list. “Even at the UN level, you could not have an agreed-upon definition of terrorism, although they do still have frameworks and designation lists. We’re seeing companies being held to the same standard or above, being asked to go above and beyond what governments are able to do, which makes companies a little wary to be that powerful gatekeeper,” she says. Rasmussen also expressed wariness of over-moderation, saying that “over-achievement in this takes you in the direction of violating someone’s rights on the internet to engage in free expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="PpkqH6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always interested in the future — so this week, we’re taking a look at the people who will live there. All week, we’re going to publish stories focused on young people, whether they’re pushing for immigration reform or making bank in the online vintage trade. The way we see it, they’re building the future, and they’re using technology to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ2Jo"&gt;We’re calling the series Next Gen, like a next-gen camera or phone. The hope is that human beings will get a little better each time around, with fewer of the hang-ups that plagued earlier models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tw4gT"&gt;To kick it off, we’re going to hear from some of those young people firsthand. In a series of four personal essays, we asked young writers to talk about the tech that’s made the biggest impact on their lives, from YouTube videos to multiplayer gaming rigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwaD4N"&gt;By the end of the week, you should have a pretty good sense of what the younger generations are up to — and what kind of future they’re building.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are $179 in-store at Staples through the rest of July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JO7oHSR_IYqNGPb2bEMYZMaxoks=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632701/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6mOlzf"&gt;Staples is hosting some stellar back-to-school deals this week, especially if tech is on your checklist. &lt;a href="https://www.staplesconnect.com/weeklyad"&gt;The AirPods Pro are $179&lt;/a&gt; (visible on the third page of the ad) and are available at this price in-store only. Originally $249, these have been falling in price, but it’s not often that they sell for less than $189. It’s worth mentioning that Staples is also offering &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13048831?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.staples.com%2Fapple-homepod-mini-my5g2ll-a-bluetooth-speaker-space-gray%2Fproduct_24490472%3FcmArea%3DCIRCULAR" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s HomePod Mini for $89&lt;/a&gt;, which ties for the lowest price yet. Unlike the AirPods Pro, Staples is offering this miniature smart speaker in-store or online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nJdyMF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613508"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw4_3VG4v2GjDGnC1mF-JdVVSGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13357959/newpencil.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rdv4sj"&gt;As noted by &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15182548-apple-pencil-2nd-generation-new-99-at-best-buy?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+SlickdealsnetFP+%28Slickdeals+Frontpage%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation Apple Pencil that’s compatible with iPads that have a USB-C port is $99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747302599779291212" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K1WWBJK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (delivery at Amazon currently delayed to August 12th). This is $30 lower than its usual price, and students who want to take notes during class should hop on this deal. Compared to the first-generation Apple Pencil that clumsily recharges via an iPad’s Lightning port, this one magnetically attaches to the side of your iPad to power up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Parsec</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new tool for an older kind of gaming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="9r1Bse"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1BzlFi"&gt;In my corner of the Bronx, March 2020 felt like the end of the world. A statewide emergency was declared on March 7th, and the city went into lockdown 13 days later, as case numbers climbed higher each day. Before lockdown, I’d been going to an esports venue nearly twice a week to play in Super Smash Bros. tournaments, but that quickly dropped out of my routine. I had just gotten a library card, too, to make more time for reading. Now the card was useless, and trips outdoors became rare. As soon as I had laid out a plan for getting productive, the world pushed me back inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dKxrM"&gt;Being stuck inside wasn’t as bad for my social life as you might think. I spent more time on Discord, seeking out new channels and new people. Some of them were streamers, others voice actors — all of them people I would have been unlikely to meet offline. Some of them became my closest friends, which made me even more anxious to find new ways to connect and spend time with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="kG9nPl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mtxxoF"&gt;Eventually, my friends from college introduced me to &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;. In simple terms, Parsec is an application that lets you screen-share your PC to anyone you wish. By creating a link to your Parsec, you can let another Parsec user see your screen and interact with it, a step beyond the basic screen shares in apps like Zoom and Discord. Linked Parsec users can even connect keyboards or controllers virtually to the host system and the app will treat them like locally connected peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4TGBE"&gt;Put it all together and it becomes a new way to play games online. A lot of games from older systems like the GameCube and Wii didn’t have online functionality, but they have local multiplayer built in. Combine Parsec with an emulator like Dolphin and a whole new world of console games opens up — games I’d never been able to play with someone who wasn’t in the same room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2m4h0B"&gt;We started out with Mario Party, which led to some hilarious moments. (You’ve never seen a player truly break until you’ve seen all of their earnings being given to someone else through Chance Time.) We played the older generation of Super Smash Bros. games, too, before moving on to Mario Kart: Double Dash and GoldenEye. Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games, providing raw, harmless fun without an overburdened story or gestures at real-world relevance. So many rivalries were born, and so many friendships were tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PNP6e8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parsec became a way to relive the aesthetic of an earlier generation of games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="369Vcr"&gt;I usually played with friends from college, and those games became some of the best memories I’ve shared with them. I had known most of them for more than a year, so we already had a good rapport, and a sense of just how much smack talk we could get past each other. We kept a Discord channel open while we played, solely for the purpose of throwing jabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFCca5"&gt;Parsec’s biggest limitation is that it requires both the host and the remote user to have strong internet connections. If either one is out of whack, then it can cause lag on that side of the game. Lag on the host side is particularly bad since it causes downstream problems for everyone in the session. (I highly recommend connecting an ethernet cable to the system you’re using since a little lag can create a lot of embarrassment.) Since I had a wired connection, I would usually end up hosting. But occasional issues on my end still caused a whole game to stutter. Still, that’s the only real problem with Parsec, and it’s more of a general cloud-gaming problem than a specific issue with the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCxpAr"&gt;Parsec is a one-track app, aimed at serving a simple purpose: remote multiplayer gaming. In some ways, it’s a simple problem to solve, but solving it well gave me a lot of happiness during what was otherwise a very hard year. Whenever I wasn’t working on writing or trawling the internet for content to watch, I would end up booting up a game and trying to get a Parsec session going. It happened nearly every day. When I think of my favorite moments from 2020, a lot of them were routed through Parsec, playing an older generation of games with newfound friends — and feeling, if only for a moment, that we were all in one room together.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: the Alicia Keys Tiny Desk concert</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fl3uKgNZSTOfzG81T7UUOdC0j9Y=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632570/VRG_4679_YT_Alicia_Keys_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking for the thrill of live music during lockdown, I turned to NPR&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="NDkD8V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="t6e1CQ"&gt;Life is weird: one minute I’m dancing in a concert mosh pit, happily crammed among strangers like a sardine in a can, and then &lt;em&gt;bam&lt;/em&gt; — pandemic. The can tilts, the music stops, and I’m flopping around without the thrill and connection of live music at a packed venue, my favorite place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqFjXK"&gt;But since lockdown, I’ve managed to find one important substitute: NPR’s Tiny Desk concerts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rGF9I"&gt;Tiny Desk concerts are exactly what they sound like: an artist performs while residing behind, well, a rather tiny desk. The series has been running since 2008, starting with indie acts like Dr. Dog and the Avett Brothers, and moving to huge names like Taylor Swift and Megan Thee Stallion in recent years. The setting is casual, the performance is laid-back — it can be as basic as an artist and an instrument — and the songs are often stripped to their core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="9oJ6Jk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9I23gU"&gt;Big deal, right? Actually, I’m so glad you asked. It’s a huge deal, even if it doesn’t seem like much at first glance. Though I appreciate the in-your-face experience of a concert (it’s hard to forget your boyfriend dragging you from a mosh pit after getting hit in the face), the magic of Tiny Desk is in its simplicity. It’s just music and people in a room, a pairing very much missed for the past year and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWdqY0"&gt;Many of my favorite Tiny Desk concerts were released toward the beginning of the pandemic. There’s King Princess’ gentle serenade, and Harry Styles’ playful laughter as he cracks jokes with the audience — two videos that fill me with an incomparable warmth, time and time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4of1f"&gt;But the one that’s stuck with me for the longest time is a performance by Alicia Keys. Recorded in February of 2020 and published the following June, the video begins with Keys telling the audience that she “just wanted to vibe out” with them. And vibe out she does. Everything about this performance — from her invitation for the audience to join her as she sings, to her unwavering smile as she plays along with her band — is exactly what music is about: coexisting with the ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sU62FW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwUt1fVLb3E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BtrZCM"&gt;As she plays the introductory chords to her song “Show Me Love,” Keys speaks about needing love “more than ever before” because “that’s really what links us.” I remember getting chills despite the unbearable summer heat, thinking how heart-wrenching it was that her call for unity had been recorded a month before the world went into lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXnaLM"&gt;I think that’s what I cherish most about this performance. It was uploaded during a time when the world was in desperate need of love, and Alicia Keys gave me an awful lot to cling to. It wasn’t just the wisdom and mindfulness she demonstrated through the duration of the show, but the way she poured her soul into the music and how she embraced the audience before her, praising them for their voices, offering everyone in the room — the audience, her band — a collective sense of belonging and purpose. The natural chemistry between the individuals in that room made me forget about the drudgery I had been stuck on and instead consider the value of human connection that I once took for granted. Even through a screen, music can connect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TWSF3Y"&gt;As I’ve watched the world revert to something resembling the normalcy of life before the year 2020, the Alicia Keys Tiny Desk concert has remained a consistent source of comfort that I’ve often turned to. It’s been the accompaniment to my happiest and saddest days, but each time, it has been exactly what I need: a gentle reminder that life is not everlasting but we will always have these humbling tidbits of humanity. This Tiny Desk concert is my treasured digital artifact. It’s my reminder that music is boundless, and that despite the ever-changing world we exist in, it is the universal constant — the one thing that helps us make sense of our existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="aTvank"&gt;And if nothing else, Tiny Desk confirmed that “Fallin’” is a damn masterpiece. It’s not mosh-pit material, but I would still do anything to be a sardine in that crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: the half-finished Duolingo course</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a-fPKAyJYBPlnzqM_AM5WsudFmQ=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632567/VRG_4679_Duolingo_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I am tormented by the specter of Duo the Owl&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="3jw7V5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="YG0jg0"&gt;I heard the notification whistle and reached for my phone instinctively. I was met with a bright screen and an ominous message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7BW7"&gt;“Hey Jamal, we’ve missed you!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WI0zDo"&gt;Instead of coming from a friend or concerned neighbor, the message came from language-learning app Duolingo. Once again, I had abandoned a Spanish course, and Duo the Owl had popped up in my notifications to remind me just how frequently I failed to complete a course on the app. It became a kind of routine: leaving a course half-finished and then watching the anxiety pile up with each notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="8XFmTI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrEb4W"&gt;I was drawn to Duolingo as a way to improve my Spanish, which had never quite clicked during college. The warp speed of university life often left me with little to no time on my hands, and languages had never been my strong suit. In my courses, I was forced to adapt to the timelines of a semester, and even when I did perform up to par, it felt like it was more about grades than actual knowledge. Duolingo seemed like a good way to break out of that trap and get comfortable with the language itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYDQwq"&gt;Part of my anxiety comes from the vulnerability I feel when testing out a new language. There’s always a period of confusion when starting something new, but I’m usually able to fake my way through it, pretending to have the skills for long enough to actually pick them up. Language isn’t like that. You can’t fake a transitive verb. When you don’t know something — when &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; don’t know something — the error is inescapable. My friends were often available to help me out, but the threat of embarrassment made me too anxious to take them up on it. When I studied alone, I spent hours perfecting one word or syllable and having imaginary conversations that never bore witness because of my trepidation. The fear of failing stopped me from trying in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUOBU7"&gt;Without realizing it, I had turned Duolingo from a hobby into a place of hyper-evaluation. If it took me longer than a week to get comfortable with a grammar or vocabulary lesson, I started to see it as impossible. I had internalized the belief that learning was meant to come innately. If I wasn’t picking up Spanish immediately, I figured my brain just wasn’t built to learn it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="paF8yx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t fake a transitive verb&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKcgHW"&gt;As it turns out, I’m not the only one who falls into this trap. Duolingo doesn’t release completion rates for its courses, but &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/us-language-report-2020/#uslearnersrank68thforhardestworkinglearnersbasedontheaveragenumberoflessonscompleted"&gt;a report last year&lt;/a&gt; said American users ranked 68th out of all countries in the number of lessons completed. A separate &lt;a href="https://forum.duolingo.com/comment/39925566/Percentage-of-people-who-finished-a-course"&gt;informal study&lt;/a&gt; put the overall completion rate for Spanish at less than 0.01 percent. Far more people are getting stuck halfway through than are finishing lessons — so maybe my half-finished lessons weren’t quite as embarrassing as I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDandG"&gt;Naturally, Duolingo thinks a lot about user retention. I spoke with Cindy Blanco, a senior language scientist at Duolingo, and she stressed that the courses aren’t intended to be one-size-fits-all. People come to Duolingo with different goals, and they may end up ditching the course once they’ve reached the level they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qd5Qom"&gt;“If you think, ‘Well, I want to go to Portugal and feel comfortable ordering in a restaurant,’ how much of the course do I need to work on so I could feel good about that experience?” she told me. “For other people it’s like, ‘Well, I really love K-pop and I want to understand the culture or read more about the bands in their own language.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXhSd7"&gt;That distinction extends to Duo the Owl, who had tormented me over my unfinished Spanish lessons. Blanco told me that the owl is designed to send different messages depending on culture and geography. In that sense, the app is focused on delivering a user experience that feels unique, even when it’s trying to rope a dormant user back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J2QpRk"&gt;Since my conversation with Cindy, I’ve begun to dig back into my Spanish lessons. But I’ve also started to think about my unfinished courses in a different way. Learning isn’t always linear. It may take a while before I get comfortable with Spanish. In fact, it may never happen at all. Once I had let go of that insistence on perfection, I started to feel much better about dipping into the occasional Spanish lesson — and much less shaken when I see an unexpected notification from a cartoon owl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpBM6r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jamal Burns is a recent graduate of Duke University. Originally from St. Louis, Missouri, he studied history with a concentration in women and sexuality studies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next Gen Favorites: Wattpad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ERFfDnZgDBMX-EWANu9UO8qAto=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632615/VRG_4679_Wattpad_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ari Liloan for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Looking beyond my local library, I found a new way to think about writing&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="KrmueU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="S1aWzP"&gt;I started reading early, and I spent my childhood hungry for stories. For the first half of my life, I was sustained by my small public library, finding solace in old, ratty copies of Lemony Snicket’s &lt;em&gt;A Series of Unfortunate Events &lt;/em&gt;and Louisa May Alcott’s &lt;em&gt;Little Women.&lt;/em&gt; It wasn’t until I was 14 that I felt the limits of my library’s bookshelves and started to look online for new, brave, curious protagonists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPZswi"&gt;That’s when I stumbled onto Wattpad. When I found it in 2012, the site functioned as a microcosm of teen popular culture, reflecting the platform’s large contingent of Gen Z and millennial users. Every scroll, regardless of genre, brought users book covers largely adorned with Photoshop edits of notable teenage heartthrobs of the time (think: Dylan O’Brien in his &lt;em&gt;Teen Wolf &lt;/em&gt;fame, or a younger, long-haired One Direction Harry Styles). Some stories even included popular song recommendations (mostly Taylor Swift) and a cast filled with A-list celebrities, in the hopes of creating an immersive experience for readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="WdCEDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="St8FbU"&gt;Founded in 2006, Wattpad has grown far beyond the scale of my local library. The platform currently boasts 90 million users and 665 million stories, ranging from historical fiction to outright fanfiction. In its 15 years of existence, Wattpad stories have gained a reputation in the online literary community — a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;landfill of self-insert fanfiction to some, and a treasure trove of hidden gems to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvNN3"&gt;As a 14-year-old, I found Wattpad’s saturation of teen popular culture exhilarating; it promised to appease my quickly shifting reading preferences. My digital library became a hoard of historical fiction and supernatural romance novels, where I surrendered to my teenage angst and lived vicariously through questionably written characters. For four years, I religiously followed the satirical but romantic &lt;em&gt;Storm and Silence &lt;/em&gt;series, treating the Wednesday chapter uploads like morning church service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pL5FbF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A nexus where the personal and professional came together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zUS5QF"&gt;I was amazed by Wattpad, not only for its riveting content, but also for its ability to shatter many traditional barriers and expectations for writing. For one, authors seemed to balance their professional and personal personas on the platform, retaining sometimes thousands of readers under pen names like “dontstealmypoptarts” or “iheartonedirection.” Where I had previously only viewed authors as elusive and mysterious, these usernames instead suggested that anyone could write a book — even people who liked Pop-Tarts and One Direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYWusr"&gt;I also loved how authors often addressed their readership directly. They would spotlight a reader of the week, offer bonus chapters, and communicate any changes to their uploading schedule. Chapters contained author’s notes, a nexus where the personal and professional came together. Sometimes there was a note about upcoming exams, at other times a tragic comment about a pet’s passing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c79YkZ"&gt;Readers also bridged the divide, offering words of encouragement or criticism. They would share their excitement, amusement, or worry in a chapter’s comment section, and interact with other users in the comments. Readers and writers developed a collaborative relationship and a sense of community, as writers are able to refine their stories with this feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9HNVGA"&gt;In 2014, I began to publish my own poems and books on the platform. My poems spoke about love and betrayals that I had not yet experienced. My books were enemies-to-lovers romance novels with bad dialogue that my 16-year-old self mistook for wit. A few of my books were ranked by the website’s popularity algorithm in broad categories, but most remained largely untouched by readers. Still, I kept writing for the joy of it. Eight years later, those pieces are like a time capsule of my teenage self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmxVvT"&gt;Wattpad has changed drastically since 2012. Book publishers have started to take notice, and the company has rolled out professionalizing features like content from established writers (“Tap Originals”) and pay-to-access works (“Paid Stories”). In January, Wattpad was acquired by a South Korean tech conglomerate, Naver Corporation, for $600 million. Like any online community, Wattpad writers are hostage to the profitability of their platform. The introduction of Wattpad coins, in particular, threatens to isolate or separate readers who aren’t able to buy them and access these new Paid Stories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDV8pQ"&gt;As someone who joined the website for its expansive, accessible, and free content, I have mixed feelings about the new features and the emphasis on monetization. It’s a familiar turn for tech platforms, and while it’s alarming, it’s better than the site shutting down entirely. As a retired Wattpad user, I can’t help but feel nostalgic for all the time I’ve spent on the platform. I hope it can survive for all the 14-year-olds still looking for a bigger library, as a space where individuals can read, write, and form community.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Surface Duo 2 photos reveal new triple camera system</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JuSok3q4ktaYDZ0sCosN7-NpXyU=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69632335/surfaceduo2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surface Duo 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Tech Rat (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQJOndIdGk" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHkkw1"&gt;Microsoft is readying a Surface Duo 2 for release later this year. Leaked images have revealed the dual-screen device will include a new triple camera system. The leaked images first appeared in a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8PQJOndIdGk"&gt;YouTube video last month&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/images-microsofts-upcoming-surface-duo-2-leak-revealing-triple-camera-setup?utm_source=wc_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=86625&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; they’re legitimate. Microsoft is expected to launch its Surface Duo 2 device in September or October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REaUu6"&gt;The camera system on the Surface Duo 2 appears to be the main significant hardware change on this device. It’s rumored to include a telephoto, ultrawide angle, and standard lens. The leaked photos show a bump at the rear of the device, just like many existing flagship Android phones. It also appears that Microsoft has moved its fingerprint reader into the power button on the Duo 2 and centered the USB-C port on the right-hand side.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrWeUA1iyKNEZhoewoQVd7w4TSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740413/surfaceduo2leak.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 reportedly includes a triple camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XgE5JJ"&gt;The Surface Duo 2 is expected to have relatively minor design tweaks overall, with most of the significant changes appearing in the camera system and internal specs. Rumors suggest the Surface Duo 2 will include Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, 5G support, and an NFC chip for contactless payments. Microsoft may even slightly increase the size of each display on the Surface Duo 2, with slightly thinner bezels and options for both black and white color variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAkMuw"&gt;Microsoft appears to be sticking with separate screens on the Surface Duo 2, instead of opting for a truly foldable screen like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;. That means all eyes will be on how well Microsoft improves the software side of the Surface Duo 2. The original device has had a variety of software updates, but Android 11 still hasn’t appeared yet. That’s left the Surface Duo as a buggy device, with regular issues with multitasking and gestures, a screen turning off during book mode, and lockups using the fingerprint reader.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new true wireless earbuds have a privacy-conscious ‘Whispering Mode’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f1DEwcUWwGaCaBTSDDiQEaGJp0c=/0x0:1724x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69631996/LG_TONE_Free_FP8_Pearl_White_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s Tone Free FP8 wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6JXuLj"&gt;LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/new-additions-to-lg-tone-free-lineup-deliver-enhanced-performance-greater-convenience/"&gt;new Tone Free FP true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; feature a “Whispering Mode” where you can hold the right earbud next to your mouth during calls to use it as a dedicated microphone. It’s a neat privacy-conscious feature for those moments when you don’t want to have to speak loudly enough for the sound to be picked up by the earbuds in your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myfucm"&gt;There are three new earbuds in the lineup — the FP5, FP8, and FP9 — and they share a lot of the same specs. All are noise cancelling, have three microphones per earbud, and have an IPX4 water resistance rating to withstand light splashes. Their earbud stems are 4.4mm shorter than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534509/lg-tone-free-fn7-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-anc-uv-case"&gt;LG’s previous models&lt;/a&gt;, and they have improved drivers and diaphragms which LG claims offers more bass without impacting clarity. Headphone Spatial Processing and 3D Sound Stage provides an audioexperience that surrounds the listener. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVuIde8Ec7JohOQeiUAaVoEjh5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22740343/LG_TONE_Free_FP9_Pearl_White.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FP9 earbuds, whose case doubles as a wireless transmitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Wgd5F"&gt;However, there are individual features exclusive to one or two of the headphones. The most interesting of these is reserved for the FP9 earbuds, whose case can double as a wireless transmitter to allow the earbuds to be used with non-Bluetooth devices. Using a USB-C to aux cable, the case can be plugged into anything from a games console to an in-flight entertainment system, removing the need to use a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20982261/airpods-in-flight-entertainment-bluetooth-adapter-twelvesouth-airfly-pro-review-price"&gt;separate Bluetooth adapter&lt;/a&gt;. It’s similar to what we saw from Bowers and Wilkins’ PI7 earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395276/bowers-and-wilkins-pi7-pi5-true-wireless-earbuds-noise-cancelling-in-flight-entertainment-price"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zp7g7W"&gt;The FP8 and FP9 earbuds feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/3/20896563/lg-tone-plus-free-true-wireless-earbuds-features-uv-light-bacteria-hygiene-google-assistant"&gt;LG’s bacteria-killing UV tech&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says can kill 99.9 percent of the bacteria on the earbuds’ speaker mesh in five minutes to reduce the chance of inner ear infections. These two earbuds also have improved battery life compared to the FP5, and can run for 10 hours on a charge, or up to 24 hours when used with their charging case (the FP5 is rated for 8 and 22 hours, respectively). Only the FP8 model supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZDqK2"&gt;LG’s new true wireless earbuds will be available starting this month in “key markets” at a price that’s yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;
