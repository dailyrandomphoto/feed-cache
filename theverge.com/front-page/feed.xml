    <title>The 2022 Volkswagen ID 5 is a sporty electric SUV with over 300 miles of range</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kMWXmz4Wl3YMh1M5BbN2KX44quA=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086532/DB2021AU00964_large.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlhcwx"&gt;Volkswagen revealed the ID 5, a smaller, sportier version of its landmark ID 4 electric SUV that will only be available in Europe. It’s the latest vehicle to join VW’s growing “ID family” of electric vehicles as the company gets closer to its 2035 deadline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551956/volkswagen-stop-selling-combustion-engine-vehicles-europe-2035"&gt;to stop selling gas-powered vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in its home continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpxxw7"&gt;VW is releasing two versions of its new EV: the entry level ID 5, and the more premium ID 5 GTX, with dual electric motors on both the front and rear axel. (GTX is for VW’s ID models what GTI, or Grand Tourer Injection, means for the Golf.) The entry-level ID 5 will be equipped with a single rear-wheel-drive motor with an output of 174 horsepower and a 77kWh battery pack — theoretically enabling over 320 miles of range. (VW has yet to release range estimates for the ID 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3eXyT"&gt;On the surface, the ID 5 looks indistinguishable from the ID 4, but a closer look reveals some key differences. It’s slightly shorter than the ID 4, with 12 millimeters less headroom in the back, and the bumper, painted door paneling, and new roof line are distinctive. Other than that, the ID 5 is basically just a coupe version of the ID 4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291294/vw-id5-ev-electric-suv-coupe-production-volkswagen-2021"&gt;Earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, a VW spokesperson said there were “no plans” to sell the ID 5 in North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Epwd5o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;VW says the ID 5 in-car features will be improved over the ID 4&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68Q2JI"&gt;VW says the ID 5 in-car features will be improved over the ID 4, including an updated voice assistant that is now “learning-enabled” with “online access to information from the cloud.” The vehicle will also be equipped with VW’s “Car2X communication” to improve safety and data collection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1vPtZJ"&gt;Data from compatible vehicles in the Volkswagen fleet and signals from infrastructure within a radius of up to 800 metres can be locally interpreted in a fraction of a second, enabling driver alerts about dangerous areas, accidents and stationary traffic. The ID. Light in the cockpit helps by providing visual warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="svI4M2"&gt;The ID 4 is the first vehicle built on VW’s modular MEB electric architecture to be available in North America. Its predecessor, the hatchback ID 3, is only being sold in Europe. The company sold over 6,000 in the first three quarters of 2021, which is fewer than the number of Mustang Mach-E SUVs sold by Ford but still a solid start for a brand-new EV in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="swoIJf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10843783"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJ7pH0"&gt;VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. The e-Golf was first launched in 2012 but was discontinued in 2020 as the automaker shifts focus to its MEB-built vehicles. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche’s first all-electric sports car, the Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274376/audi-etron-gt-rs-electric-car-specs-price"&gt;the E-Tron GT&lt;/a&gt;. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;now six-year-old Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars in order to trick emissions tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ujqmG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brydge’s 11-inch Max Plus iPad keyboard is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbnJyj0hA9CRKotgVWZESUMN71c=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086425/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge 11 Max Plus keyboard with an 11-inch iPad Pro in it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PWj0BD"&gt;Following the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22553643/brydge-12-9-max-plus-review-price-shipping"&gt;12.9-inch Max Plus keyboard for the iPad&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Brydge is now releasing an 11-inch version. The new, smaller keyboard has all of the same features as its bigger sibling, including Brydge’s new magnetic mounting system and Instant-On Bluetooth tech, but is sized to fit all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro and the fourth-generation of the 10.5-inch iPad Air. It’s available starting today, November 3rd, from both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Brydge’s online store&lt;/a&gt; and Amazon for $199.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR0P3l"&gt;Despite its smaller size, the 11-inch Max Plus’ pitch is exactly the same as the 12.9-inch model’s: it’s meant to provide a MacBook-like experience with an iPad. That includes a full keyboard layout with a function row, plus a large trackpad that supports multitouch gestures and navigation. The aluminum chassis can be purchased in either a dark gray or a silver finish to match your iPad’s color, and it has a very MacBook-like appearance when the iPad is installed in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AxoD1EnoshadMbeA7wjhr95UBKA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980077/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back panel of the 11 Max Plus is plastic and has tabs to easily pop the iPad off of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sq5nntfMZ3aBYNgydxlj_THVy00=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980078/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus connects to the iPad’s built-in magnets to hold it in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P7ayvW"&gt;The big new innovation with the Max Plus line is the magnetic attachment system, which eschews the clamps Brydge used in older designs for a full backplate that connects to the magnets inside the iPad to hold it in place. The advantage here is that it allows you to quickly remove the iPad from the keyboard and use it handheld and just as easily snap it back into place when you want to use the keyboard again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p84uXJ"&gt;The Max Plus does not use the iPad’s Smart Connector, relying instead on a Bluetooth connection with the tablet. To overcome the usual delays that happen when using a Bluetooth keyboard with an iPad, Brydge developed its Instant-On technology, which allows the keyboard to stay connected to the iPad for up to four hours, even if it isn’t being used, without detrimental battery drain on either the case or the iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7G61ky"&gt;This makes waking up the iPad feel much the same as a directly connected keyboard and mitigates one of the major complaints with Bluetooth. Brydge claims up to three months of battery life between charges, but that varies greatly on how much you utilize the three-level backlight. In the week or so I’ve been testing the product, I’ve not had to charge it back up once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ax7BVZ"&gt;Brydge CEO Nick Smith tells me that the company’s inspiration for the keyboard feel was the vaunted 2015 MacBook Pro. As a result, the Max Plus keys have a bit more travel than either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547938/logitech-combo-touch-ipad-air-fourth-generation"&gt;Logitech’s Combo Touch&lt;/a&gt;, the two main competitors in this space. The keycaps themselves are also a little smaller and have a little bit more space between them, but I had no trouble getting comfortable with the layout after a few minutes of use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n88GEQqlJgIPgnFRtSS2HfnuTE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980079/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 11 Max Plus has a full keyboard with function row and a large multitouch trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NzwXx3"&gt;Brydge is also very proud of the size of the trackpad it was able to include with the Max Plus; the 11-inch model has a larger trackpad than either Apple or Logitech’s keyboard. It supports multitouch gestures and has good tracking, if not quite as precise as Apple has in the Magic Keyboard. Due to the smaller size of the 11-inch’s deck, I did have a few instances of palm rejection, which caused my cursor to jump across the screen when I didn’t expect it to. But otherwise, the trackpad experience on the Max Plus is quite nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxdnmp"&gt;Using the Max Plus keyboard is a different experience than the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch, by design. It’s a chunkier, heftier product, adding nearly two pounds of weight to the iPad itself, but it’s more stable on a lap, like you’d expect a laptop to be. It’s also more comfortable to type on for longer periods because the deck provides more room to rest your hands. And the full function row is a boon compared to the Magic Keyboard, which requires reaching up to use the iPad’s buttons or touch the screen anytime you want to adjust brightness or volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPwJcz"&gt;Lastly, because the Max Plus uses a Bluetooth connection, you can remove the iPad from the case and still use the keyboard and trackpad with it. I particularly liked putting the iPad in a portrait orientation when working on a long document, which you can’t do with the Magic Keyboard or the Combo Touch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZo1MBkMOokkxIqaaoS6YU9rVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22980081/dseifert_4858_brydge_11_max_plus_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When closed, the 11 Max Pro is chunkier than other keyboards, but preserves the MacBook-like aesthetic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrsgNm"&gt;The Max Plus is also not designed to provide much in the way of protection. Unlike Logitech’s Combo Touch, when you remove it from the keyboard, you’re holding a bare iPad, and it doesn’t provide any corner protection from drops. If you are looking for a more protective design that has similar traits as the Max Plus, Brydge offers the plastic &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-air-max-plus%3Fvariant%3D39421148594281&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22759698%2Fbrydges-11-inch-max-plus-ipad-keyboard-now-available-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Air Max Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which provides four feet of drop protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoEeWd"&gt;At $200, the Max Plus undercuts Apple by about $100 and is priced similarly to the Combo Touch. It’s not a budget product by any means; that’s reflected in the copious amount of aluminum used and the long feature list. But if you’re looking for a way to get more out of your 11-inch iPad Pro or iPad Air and want a more traditional experience than Apple’s keyboard provides, there’s a lot to like here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ VivoBook 13 Slate is a detachable laptop with an OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user watches a movie on the Asus Vivobook 13 Slate, stood horizontally on its kickstand without the keyboard or stylus attached, on a red table." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMbBaE2_xBNGoChaOhhfmSFTv40=/580x428:2920x1988/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086427/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_T3300_Entertainment.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Vivobook 13 Slate OLED has a keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KLDKTo"&gt;Asus is known for delving into unconventional form factors, and its latest experiment is no exception. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2FLaptops%2FFor-Home%2FVivobook%2FVivobook-13-Slate-OLED-T3300%2F%3Futm_source%3Dmedia%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3D21q4_wowtheworld_hq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761276%2Fasus-vivobook-13-slate-oled-price-release-date-features-screen-stylus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VivoBook 13 Slate OLED&lt;/a&gt; is a 13.3-inch Windows tablet with an OLED screen and a detachable keyboard which starts at $599.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAIh2U"&gt;OLED screens are unusual, though not unheard of, in the detachable form factor. Asus claims that this one is capable of displaying 1.07 billion colors, covers 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and has a 0.2-millisecond response time. It’s said to have blue-light levels “up to 70 percent lower than an LCD display” (although many modern LCD PCs also have technology to &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/4aa6d3d3-f12e-46e7-87b9-313bd31ed89a"&gt;reduce blue light&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWODUT"&gt;Rather than framing the Slate as purely a tablet for artists, though, Asus seems to be pushing it as an entertainment device. The company emphasizes that the tablet’s 16:9 aspect ratio “provides a full-screen viewing experience” (which is basically the only thing 16:9 screens are good for). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoHgYt"&gt;The Slate OLED also ships with a stylus, the Asus Pen 2.0, which attaches magnetically to the chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vivobook 13 Slate OLED stood horizontally on a red desk beside a small stack of books with the keyboard attached. The screen displays the Asus Vivobook OLED logo on a multicolored background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRrVj0h8fS9cW_eEn0PVsBMuuCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982581/Vivobook_13_Slate_OLED_T3300_Laptop_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is with the keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R1OJKh"&gt;Certainly, $599.99 is an affordable price as OLED products go. It’s also a refreshing one for detachable Windows laptops. A decent model of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; would be close &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1023026/7613?subId1=VergeVivoBook110321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to twice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeVivoBook110321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-8%2F8QWCRTQ8V8XG%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f2c%26selectedColor%3D86888a%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that price&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s not including a keyboard and stylus (which are bundled in the VivoBook 13 Slate OLED’s price). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3g4au"&gt;OLED screens are becoming more common on 13-inch and 14-inch laptops across the board. Samsung announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242005/samsung-display-oled-laptop-production-90hz-14-inch"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would soon begin mass-producing laptop-sized OLED panels and actually started that production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676223/samsung-display-90hz-oled-laptop-screens-lenovo-asus"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. The new Samsung panels are featured on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652549/asus-proart-studiobook-16-pro-oled-vivobook-expertbook"&gt;a number of 2021 Asus releases.&lt;/a&gt; Shoppers can now find smaller and more affordable OLED devices from other manufacturers as well, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22660761/lenovo-chromebook-duet-detachable-release-oled"&gt;Lenovo’s Duet 5 detachable Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNXyuZ"&gt;The VivoBook 13 Slate OLED will be available in December. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YjlYFo"&gt;Amazon has affirmed its support for the smart home connectivity standard Matter, announcing in a &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2021/11/support-for-matter-over-thread-coming-to-echo-and-eero-devices"&gt;blog post today&lt;/a&gt; that it will support Matter over Thread in its Echo devices and Eero Wi-Fi routers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22741839/eero-ceo-confirms-matter-support-thread"&gt;Eero had previously confirmed its support of the standard&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says the announcement is about “further expanding Amazon’s commitment to Matter and reinforcing its smart home philosophy of flexibility, privacy, collaboration, and interoperability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OLSFc"&gt;Additionally, Amazon has joined Apple, Google, and Samsung on the Thread Group Board of Directors — it has been a member for five years. Alongside Wi-Fi, Thread is a primary protocol for Matter. It provides a low-power, low-bandwidth, and low-latency mesh network for smart home devices to connect to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufs62n"&gt;The company confirmed that the Echo 4th gen will gain Matter over Thread support, with support for additional Echo devices coming later. Earlier this summer, Amazon said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586377/amazon-echo-matter-standard-dot-show-studio-flex-plus-upgrade"&gt;it would upgrade most of its Echo smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; to support Matter, including most Echo and Echo Dot speakers and every Echo Studio, Echo Show, Echo Plus, and Echo Flex. All Eero Pro, Eero Beacon, Eero Pro 6, and Eero 6 devices have Thread radios in and already act as Thread border routers for Thread devices to connect to. They will gain Matter support next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="15Q1PJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 4th Gen Echo will be the first one to get Matter support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f9iWN0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an IP-based application protocol that will establish a common language and common interaction model across smart home devices and ecosystems. With support for Matter over Thread and Wi-Fi in Echo devices, Alexa users should be able to connect any Matter-enabled smart home devices to their Echo smart speakers and control them within the Alexa app and with Alexa voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcHycT"&gt;For example, Amazon name-checked Eve in a list of companies it is working with around Matter. Eve, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22310378/eve-smart-home-thread-plug-home-kit-weather-station-price-specs-features"&gt;makes smart home devices&lt;/a&gt; such as sensors, plugs, switches, and lighting, has previously only worked with Apple’s HomeKit, but with Matter, its products will be able to connect to Alexa and other smart home ecosystems. Amazon also mentioned Yale, Wemo, Schlage, Sengled, Netatmo, Nanoleaf, Tuya, eWeLink, and Leedarson as brands that are creating Matter over Thread devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aum2WY"&gt;One of Matter’s main promises is multi-admin control. This means you should be able to control any Amazon smart home device that supports Matter using any other Matter controller. SmartThings, Google, and Apple have all committed to Matter, so in theory, you will be able to use those companies' apps and voice assistants to control your Amazon smart home devices, should you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QOWPM"&gt;There are no Matter devices available to buy yet, as the standard is still being finalized. But according to the Connectivity Standards Alliance, which oversees Matter, we should start seeing Matter-enabled smart home products later in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE0VSw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL579P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVADbM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stack Overflow’s copy / paste keyboard is no joke</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Hear me out&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="wRd2Pw"&gt;A Stack Overflow-branded keyboard with just three buttons (Ctrl, C, and V) is a &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/03/31/the-key-copy-paste/"&gt;great April Fools’ gag&lt;/a&gt; that has no business being as neat and useful as it is. And yet Stack Overflow and manufacturer Drop have managed to turn The Key into a surprisingly competent little $29 accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq8uQG"&gt;On its surface, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Fbuy%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-macropad&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Key&lt;/a&gt; looks like it’s only capable of doing two things: copying and pasting. You shamelessly copy your code from Stack Overflow’s thousands (millions?) of helpful contributors and paste it into your own work. Simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6kzsh"&gt;But The Key is a lot more powerful than that. It draws upon QMK open-source keyboard firmware so that it can be fully reprogrammed to do so much more than just copy and paste. It’s not the most user-friendly process, but it’s enough to turn The Key from a goofy novelty into a great little accessory. And it might actually be worth tracking one down when Drop has more in stock next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FlsmLW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10843447"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fJr7fl"&gt;Right off the bat, I should say that in functional terms The Key isn’t doing anything particularly new or original. Head over to eBay and search for “Macro Keypad” and you’ll find dozens of inexpensive keyboard add-ons with anywhere from a single blank key to nine or more. The &lt;a href="https://keeb.io/products/bdn9-rev-2-3x3-9-key-macropad-rotary-encoder-and-rgb"&gt;BDN9 from Keebio&lt;/a&gt; is another option I’ve seen recommended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftk3vY"&gt;But The Key ends up succeeding where another diminutive keyboard I bought a couple of months back did not. And it’s also available preassembled, unlike other boards that are aimed much more firmly at hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjr2iU"&gt;For starters, The Key is straight up nicely made. Its case is made out of aluminum, and underneath each key is a linear Kailh Box Black switch that’s just a hair stiffer than regular Cherry MX Reds. Press one, and it has a nice thunk to it, like you’d expect from a mechanical switch. It even has a modern USB-C port on its back for connecting to your PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgTAiw4v-rzOFfAiBNgyUi8gfJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938115/jporter_211018_4805_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kailh Box Black switches sit under each key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6dgcrF"&gt;More importantly, it’s also got relatively &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%3Fsort%3Dvotes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;easy-to-follow instructions available on Drop&lt;/a&gt; to help you reprogram it. In contrast, the last macro board I bought arrived without any documentation in a plain cardboard box, and its eBay listing directed me toward a chaotic Discord server filled with confused customers and (admittedly) helpful support staff. For all I know, there are much better documented cheap macro boards available, but my experience so far wasn’t ideal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFDpV"&gt;Before I get into reprogramming The Key, I should clarify that, yes, it’s capable of copying and pasting out of the box… for most Windows users. The key with the Stack Overflow logo acts as your “Ctrl” key, and the C and V keys act as you’d expect. You know the drill, you don’t need me to explain how copying and pasting works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Idxc9w"&gt;Obviously this is a problem for Mac users, where the default copying and pasting shortcuts rely on the Cmd key rather than Ctrl, and any Mac users who want to use The Key will have to reprogram their device accordingly. The Key’s layout was also a problem for me specifically because I use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18223384/dvorak-qwerty-keyboard-layout-10-years-speed-ergonomics"&gt;Dvorak keyboard layout rather than QWERTY&lt;/a&gt;, which confused The Key’s default layout and caused the C key to register as a “J,” and the “V” to register as a “K.” What I needed was for the “C” switch to be rebound to “I” and for the “V” to be rebound to the “.” (compare &lt;a href="https://thekindle3books.com/qwerty-vs-dvorak-the-two-great-keyboards-the-time-were-born/"&gt;QWERTY’s layout side by side with Dvorak&lt;/a&gt; and this will make a little more sense). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcWrIg"&gt;Fixing these problems forced me to get acquainted with programming The Key, and I’m glad I did. It opened up the full possibilities of this macro pad, which can do so much more than just copy and paste. The amount of commands QMK supports &lt;a href="https://docs.qmk.fm/#/keycodes?id=keycodes-overview"&gt;is a little mind boggling&lt;/a&gt;, and you can even have one key perform multiple tasks using a modifier key. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BYp_6ASI0WX9csMcNQ4yaaNnThY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938119/jporter_211018_4805_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eRjM4"&gt;So maybe you want to use The Key as a small trio of media playback controls (play / pause, skip forward, skip back) or for volume (volume up, volume down, mute). Or maybe you want to go even further and program each key to a macro, where each key can handle a series of button presses automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99Rn3X"&gt;That’s where I ended up after I decided to turn The Key into a Zoom shortcut macro pad, inspired in part by the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lanewinfield/zoomout"&gt;many DIY projects&lt;/a&gt; that emerged last year. Two of its buttons could handle turning my camera and microphone on and off respectively, and a third would quit the Zoom call entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="o02fR4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Yes, the copying and pasting works&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V3B15l"&gt;What’s nice is that as well as programming simple key combinations (Alt+V for the camera and Alt+A for the microphone), QMK also lets you program multiple stages. So as well as programming a button to hit the Alt+Q command to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; the process of exiting a Zoom meeting, I could also program it to follow up with a tap of the “Enter” key. So now my colleagues won’t have to see me stare awkwardly into the middle distance the next time I forget about Zoom’s confirmation dialog box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLBnBI"&gt;There are a lot of keyboards out there that already offer macro keys like this. Companies like Corsair and Logitech have long offered models with extra programmable buttons, and there are much fancier devices like Elgato’s $149.99 Stream Deck which include small displays on each key to let you customize their appearance as well as their function. But The Key costs just $29. It’s an affordable, and yet surprisingly flexible, alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUjUaF"&gt;There are some downsides to using The Key like this, but not many. First, as I alluded to above, there’s obviously no way to change the keycaps’ legends when you reprogram their commands. They’re nicely made PBT keycaps with legends printed on using dye sublimation, but whatever fancy functions you program them to perform, they’re going to look the same way. So your options are to commit their functions to memory, buy some more appropriate keycaps, or maybe stick on some ugly Post-it notes to keep track of what each key is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="2T72g1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It can’t compete with a Stream Deck, but at $29 it doesn’t have to&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GrTGaM"&gt;The second problem is that although &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%3Fsort%3Dvotes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drop’s instructions&lt;/a&gt; are straightforward, actually flashing the custom firmware to The Key is a little cumbersome. You have to unscrew the four screws on the underside of the board to expose the PCB inside, where you’ll find a physical button to press and put the keyboard into flashing mode. It’s fine if you’re planning on just setting up The Key once and then forgetting about it, but a little annoying if you want to experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8Hojm"&gt;Finally, although I found &lt;a href="https://kbfirmware.com/"&gt;KBFirmware.com&lt;/a&gt; an intuitive way to remap The Key, I’d be remiss if I didn’t point out that it’s technically end-of-life and hence there’s a risk of it being shut down. I tried using a different QMK configurator, &lt;a href="http://config.qmk.fm"&gt;Config.QMK.fm&lt;/a&gt;, to design a layout and got an error message saying it’s not compatible with the configuration files Drop has provided for The Key. When I asked Drop about this, it said it was actively working to fix the issue, and pointed me toward a complicated-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2Ftalk%2F93641%2Fhow-to-configure-stack-overflow-the-key-macropad%2F2848184%3Futm_source%3Dlinkshare%26referer%3DBQTJ2K&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22761188%2Fstack-overflow-the-key-copy-paste-review-price-release-date-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;community-made fix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-roieiqbfjWvMJVlSTH-vklnXlc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938117/jporter_211018_4805_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port handles connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkPIz0"&gt;Out of the box The Key is a silly novelty. Copying and pasting is a task so common I imagine every computer user has committed it to muscle memory, and your keyboard’s existing Ctrl, C, and V keys are sitting right there underneath your left hand. Training yourself to reach for a separate keyboard is a pointless waste of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V19S3S"&gt;Which is why it’s great that Stack Overflow and Drop haven’t half-assed The Key, despite its silly novelty status. It’s not doing anything particularly new or original, but it’s well made, well documented, and incredibly flexible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74WAY1"&gt;The biggest problem with The Key at the moment is that it’s incredibly difficult to get hold of. Drop tells me it’s already sold out of an additional production run that’s due to ship in December, and although it’s got another run planned for next year, it declined to share more details than that. You can sign up to be notified when Drop has more available, but who knows when that’ll be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qqb5wc"&gt;The Key isn’t going to be giving Elgato’s Stream Deck a run for its money, but if you’re craving a couple of extra media keys or macros after downsizing to a super compact &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21048109/fujitsu-happy-hacking-keyboard-professional-3-classic-hybrid-type-s-mechanical-ces-2020"&gt;Happy Hacking keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a pretty neat option. It just might be a while before Drop’s supply catches up with demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW2uyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfkJv0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eero’s Pro 6 highlights the latest early Black Friday sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yQNG8tyvpA7-z-A8aO5_Vvjox3Q=/142x0:1678x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70086066/dseifert_201213_4337_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyjO75"&gt;November has come roaring out of the gates with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;some strong deals&lt;/a&gt; and early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; sales. It’s not every year that you can start buying holiday gifts and know you’re getting the best deals possible, even before we push the clocks back, but that’s what we’re looking at here with these discounts on Eero mesh routers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQeaUN"&gt;You can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-pack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0866V73R6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack&lt;/a&gt; of Eero Pro 6 tri-band mesh Wi-Fi 6 routers at Amazon and Best Buy for all-time low prices. Eero mesh routers are popular for good reason. They offer one of the simplest and streamlined ways to bring a solid Wi-Fi connection to all corners of your house, regardless of its size or tricky layout. And, you can add more routers to your mesh Wi-Fi system later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1cFIn"&gt;When we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;reviewed the Eero Pro 6 line&lt;/a&gt;, we had mixed feelings about how “Pro” these models were at their high-end gigabit performance. Though, our primary complaint was how expensive they originally sell for, and these deals go a long way to rectify that. Plus, this is the model to get if you need to connect several devices, including wired Ethernet devices, since each router has two Ethernet ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MG51pH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YuKimY"&gt;For larger homes (up to 6,000 square feet, according to Eero’s spec sheet), a three-pack of the Pro 6 is just $449 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VNCZHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVkBgAVUXS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a full $150 off the usual price of $600. While it might sound like overkill to go for a three-pack if you don’t own a small mansion, keep in mind the layout of your house. The multiple nodes can help if your home has a bit more of an oblong-shaped floor plan, like a ranch-style that is longer in one direction, or if the routers’ signal needs to pass through several walls or a floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="isICaI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9624413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="My5p7A"&gt;Don’t own a giant house, or you’re rocking the apartment life? Don’t worry — we did not forget about you. The Eero Pro 6 one-pack is also on sale. It’s just $171 at Amazon and Best Buy, compared to its usual $229. It’s not a bad idea to start out with just one since you can always add more routers to the system later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vdghbt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10843446"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpaonM"&gt;Another great selection of deals for today is Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23602414011&amp;amp;ref=dx_early_gd_dcl_tlt_2_3e381fc9_dt_sl5_b3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;early Black Friday sale on Philips Hue smart lighting&lt;/a&gt;. This one is just for today, and it offers some exceptional prices for color or white bulbs. You can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Bluetooth-Compatible-Assistant/dp/B08D9N7RJ4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of color bulbs for $80&lt;/a&gt;, a big discount off its full price of $135. This is a great price for Hue bulbs, and they can adjust to nearly any color you desire — great for accent lighting in lamps or even as the main bulbs for the room. They don’t come with a bridge to connect them via your local network, but they are controllable via Bluetooth with the Philips Hue app. The Hue ecosystem is expansive, so you can always add more to it. This is a great pack to get started or to further build out your repertoire of smart bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="562gLm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10649409"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fvTQp2"&gt;If you prefer more fine-tuned control through the Hue smartphone app or even via a wall-mount switch, the Philips Hue white LED smart button kit is another option to consider. These bulbs cannot take on every color of the rainbow, but they can be adjusted from a relaxing warm white to an energizing bright white. This kit comes with the bridge hub, so you can expand the system and use more smart functionality through the app. The included smart button can mount to a wall, without any wiring, to control the lights smartphone-free. This is a lot of functionality and convenience for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-Starter-HomeKit-Assistant/dp/B07XC2CXKK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$80, on sale just for today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GE Appliances wants you to trust its smart oven to cook the perfect turkey </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIFR-w2lDUN7AU9iszeZoLJRnYU=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085558/kriech_higdon_photo_9231.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new Turkey Mode coming to GE’s Wi-Fi connected ovens and ranges this week promises to cook the perfect turkey&lt;/em&gt; | IMAGE: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SjT25"&gt;The smart kitchen is getting a little more intelligent this holiday season. Appliance manufacturer GE Appliances has a new Turkey Mode for its smart ovens that promises to take the prep and guesswork out of roasting that big bird. It arrives on over half a million GE Appliances connected ovens and ranges this week via an over-the-air software upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNqBos"&gt;The Kentucky-based GE Appliances gave me a demo of the new tech, and it’s pretty impressive. You put the bird in the roasting tin, pop it in a cold oven, insert the temperature probe built into the oven, push the Turkey Mode button (either on the LCD screen of the oven or in the GE Appliances SmartHQ smartphone app), and sit back and relax. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/na-H_1AqYxMPED30ECZeuYpIhsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982371/kriech_higdon_photo_2_1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Kriech-Higdon Photography&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GE Appliances says cooking a turkey in its smart ovens will be as easy as insert probe and push Turkey Mode this holiday season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Org2"&gt;There is no basting, stuffing, brining, fiddling with foil, preheating, or panicking about whether it’s over or undercooked. And most importantly, there is no math; whether the bird is 12lbs or 20lbs, Turkey Mode calculates the cook time and executes its cooking algorithms to bring the bird to 170 degrees a few hours later. And if you want to, you can monitor the turkey and temperature in real time through the app or LCD screen. When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NpTF5N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When it’s ready, the oven timer will go “Gobble, gobble.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YeVOSb"&gt;Sabrina Hannah, a food scientist at GE Appliances, explained that her team cooked hundreds of turkeys to perfect the algorithms, and she’s confident your turkey will turn out just as perfectly juicy and crispy as the one they showed me in the demo.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q6UeATVbCrhohPva0ouIvIXNiI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982383/Turkey_Mode_UPDATE_noticeLCD_FLOW.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GE Appliances&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turkey Mode is part of GE Appliances smart oven’s Precision Cooking programs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYkCKw"&gt;The Turkey Mode feature will be available in a total of 336 GE Appliances’ ovens, including Monogram, Café, GE Profile, and GE models. It’s part of GE Appliances Precision Cooking program available on its smart ovens that guides cooking everything from cakes and cookies to salmon and beef tenderloin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY39yF"&gt;Manufacturers are still struggling to convince people to buy smart versions of their large kitchen appliances. But innovations such as this one — and GE Appliances’ recent over-the-air update to add an air fryer mode to its ovens — help provide reasons to consider the upgrade next time you’re appliance shopping. An oven that gets new, helpful features like Turkey Mode after you’ve bought it is pretty smart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PvsDx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPvgLJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 3rd, 10:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Updated all references to GE to GE Appliances&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There will never be another Pokémon Go</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="pokemon go mewtwo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1x-ruaq0G00_JYaTuR8fwG7Lq_Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085713/DSCF5354.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSrbkL"&gt;Creating a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is an impossible task. The game was the kind of breakout success that had never been seen before — and might never happen again; it’s hard to overstate how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15888210/pokemon-go-one-year-anniversary-timeline"&gt;the game was absolutely &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; when it first launched in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. People were trespassing to catch Squirtles as the game set App Store download records. The wish fulfillment that came from seeing pokémon in the real world created a sensation that, even years after its peak, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565654/pokemon-go-5-billion-fifth-anniversary-revenue-analytics"&gt;remains one of the biggest games in the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZBrOq"&gt;It was only natural that developer Niantic would try to follow that with something new. But re-creating the lightning in a bottle that is &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t gone quite as planned, despite Niantic snapping up some enviable properties to adapt. After a year of early access, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: Settlers&lt;/em&gt; will shut down later this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;which launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t fare much better: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759677/harry-potter-wizards-unite-shutting-down-january-2022-niantic-ar"&gt;the game is closing down next January&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not just Niantic, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Microsoft also had little success with the short-lived &lt;em&gt;Minecraft Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560776/the-witcher-monster-slayer-ar-mobile-ios-android-game"&gt;A monster-hunting &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; game debuted in the summer to little acclaim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhuSdN"&gt;The obvious answer is that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was a fluke and that real-world, augmented reality games don’t have much of a future beyond catching pocket monsters. But there might be another reason for the string of failed releases: everyone is aiming too high.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fKhxiIyxdg7C33CpizqbHyU717Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16501474/cgartenberg_190621_3508_3530.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Utyid4"&gt;Two things can be true. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is a once-in-a-lifetime hit that will never be replicated, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; location-based AR games have a future beyond it. You don’t need to look much further than Niantic’s latest release, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, to see that potential future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwA7fo"&gt;Whereas &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; both seemed like an attempt to create the next big thing, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; is much less ambitious. To start, it’s barely a game at all. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is more of an app designed to encourage walking by making it more playful. I’ve been using it for around a week, and it’s more like pleasant background noise than an immersive game. You collect pikmin and fruit to feed them by going out for walks, and you can also grow new creatures by, you guessed it, walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh3aCl"&gt;It’s a simple sort of gamification that adds just that little bit of extra incentive to head out of the house. It also has some charming Nintendo-esque touches (the game was co-developed by Nintendo and Niantic’s Tokyo studio), like the way you wave goodbye to your pikmin when they go out on expeditions or the scrapbook-like journal the game creates each day to remind you what you did. The simplicity of &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is what makes it work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RszDen"&gt;As live service games have become more dominant, they’ve also run into an issue: players only have so much free time. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; may be massive ongoing hits, but they also leave little room for other similar games. The same is true for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;-style real-world games. The current iteration of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; is surprisingly demanding; it requires going out to gyms to battle and navigating the tricky world of raising the strongest possible pokémon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4rGvv4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFdpE3UHxzY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZS1zqh"&gt;Players have latched onto that, and many are willing to invest what &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; asks. They’ve been doing it for years at this point. But it’s also clear that other AR games aren’t able to capture the same level of attention. You can’t just take the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; formula and tack it on to another fictional world, even one as popular as &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;. If you could, we wouldn’t have this deluge of games shutting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECB16w"&gt;Which is what makes &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; so clever. It’s unassuming and demands little from you; it’s even set in one of Nintendo’s more niche fictional worlds. But the app also utilizes many of the things that made &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; such a success. The real-world integration gives you an excuse to venture a little further on a walk, so you can sow a few more flowers. The pikmin-planting mechanic encourages extra steps since walking helps make them grow. And then there’s the AR component, which lets you see what the cute, colorful plant creatures look like crawling around your living room or hanging out in a local park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xnkGA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; isn’t destined to be the next mainstream hit. It’s unlikely that we’ll see it create a deluge of memes and local news reports. Instead, it posits a much more realistic future for location-based AR games — one where a few small apps fit neatly into your life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Indiegogo switches gears to more closely screen crowdfunding campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo of the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance, showing a hand with a shield and checkmark. The image lists Indiegogo and GoFundMe as members." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a5hYveHFp2AxAiQgAEpAI_1wSzk=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085536/logo_lockup_white.0.19.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYsa4f"&gt;Crowdfunding platform Indiegogo is changing the way it does business, shifting from an open platform where anyone can raise money for just about any purpose to a closed model where every campaign will receive a manual review before it can go live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4J3gCo"&gt;“Candidly, we have not always lived up to our backers’ expectations,” said &lt;a href="https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2021/11/10-years-1-takeaway-community-trust.html"&gt;Will Haines&lt;/a&gt;, vice president of product and customer trust at Indiegogo. When the company launched in 2008, there were few restrictions on would-be entrepreneurs seeking to raise money from like-minded backers. But Haines says that “open” isn’t what the crowdfunding community really wants now, more than a decade later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8KnkW"&gt;“Crowdfunding is not shopping — people generally understand that now — but it also shouldn’t be a leap in the dark,” he said. Backers count on the platform to be a safe and trusted space, Haines said. But, he added, “the risk has to be worth it, and backers need the tools to make an informed decision.” In addition to reviewing campaigns before they can launch, the company plans to work more closely with the entrepreneurs behind a campaign to ensure they have a solid plan and enough knowledge to bring their product or idea to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d72QKS"&gt;The new approach is being used on a small number of campaigns and will be rolled out more widely in the coming months, the company said. Indiegogo also has created an internal review board to oversee and evaluate the riskiest campaigns on its platform, as determined by its community of backers. The board can take action ranging from banning campaign owners from launching new campaigns, sending campaign owners to collections, and reporting them to law enforcement if necessary. Such actions would be reserved for campaigns Indiegogo believed to be working under “malintent” and if the company doesn’t hear back from a campaign owner after several attempts to contact them or failure to comply with its terms of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2DIuW"&gt;Haines said that Indiegogo’s mission at launch was to create a global network, where a community of entrepreneurs and enthusiasts could bring ideas to life. Built into that ethos was a negative perception of gatekeepers, Haines said. “Our biggest asset is the crowd, the people willing to take on some level of risk.” The company said between 2010 and 2020, Indiegogo contributions — the money backers give to campaigns — have grown by 5,515 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hhKfLD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVyXn3"&gt;Entrepreneurs, however — especially those seeking to raise money — have been incentivized to oversell their ideas and present them as groundbreaking or revolutionary, a mindset with which most crowdfunding backers are unlikely to be familiar. That can create something of a gap in understanding between the two sides. “Our job is to identify what’s needed to fill that gap, to make sure backers understand what the gap is,” Haines said. “What I see as the holy grail for us moving forward is not to remove all the risk but be clear about the level of risk. If you want to get in on something when it’s a sketch on a napkin, you should recognize that the thing you ultimately receive is not going to be exactly the sketch on the napkin.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvkXvr"&gt;As part of its efforts toward cracking down on fraudulent campaigns, Indiegogo has partnered with fellow crowdfunding platform GoFundMe to create a new entity to establish best practices for the crowdfunding industry and to weed out bad actors who defraud well-meaning backers of crowdfunding campaigns. The companies describe the Crowdfunding Trust Alliance as a way for platforms to work collectively toward the goal of creating “clear trust and safety standards for the industry as a whole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bn8ZOV"&gt;The two companies haven’t yet invited Kickstarter, the largest crowdfunding platform, to join the alliance, but an Indiegogo spokesperson said both companies want any reputable crowdfunding platforms involved and “absolutely encourage [Kickstarter] to join.” The founding members of the alliance will be reaching out to other platforms in the near future, the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk09Q5"&gt;It’s a bit of a shift for an industry that has largely disclaimed responsibility if a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21156136/ibackpack-smart-backpack-kickstarter-indiegogo-crowdfunding-scam-investigation-ftc-doug-monahan"&gt;campaign fails to deliver on its promises&lt;/a&gt;; they’re just the conduit, the platforms have maintained, and any crowdfunding backer assumes a certain amount of risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnLdBs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvDm2e"&gt;Under the terms of the new alliance, organizations won’t share confidential information, and third-party vendors won’t be allowed to join. To be eligible, an organization has to be well-established — at least three years old — and “generally respected” within the industry. Alliance members must unanimously approve any new applicants. So details about specific campaigns or campaign organizers wouldn’t be up for discussion, but members might share best practices to handle certain trust and safety situations they encounter, for instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8Lwvn"&gt;There’s good reason for crowdfunding as an industry to tighten oversight of people who would use their platforms for nefarious purposes; a well-publicized scam on one platform creates wariness among potential backers for any future crowdfunding effort. “A high-profile failure reflects on the whole industry,” Haines said. “It’s in all of our best interests that platforms are reputable.” He added that he doesn’t think it’s necessary to have every crowdfunding platform on board with the new alliance, but he’d be happy to see a larger reduction in scams. “If there’s nowhere for the fraudsters to go, that’s fantastic,” he said. “I want to get there.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zLBk2k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“... a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eqiJp"&gt;Juan Benitez, president of GoFundMe, said working with other platforms will be key for reducing crowdfunding fraud across the board. “And I’ll be quite honest, you know, a lot of the bad folks collaborate pretty well,” he said. “So I think it’s very important for the platforms to collaborate and have sharing of best practices, technology and resources.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz4TuF"&gt;Benitez added that GoFundMe would welcome more members of the crowdfunding industry to join the new alliance. “That just collectively helps us all be stronger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFcNfp"&gt;In addition to expanding globally over the past decade, crowdfunding platforms have also evolved to include much more personal campaigns for things like medical bills or funeral costs. Benitez says he has found the variety of situations that people can be involved in to be striking. “It’s so amazing, and frankly energizing, for GoFundMe to be able to create a place where people can engage on those things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqZ0VS"&gt;In a blog post &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gofundme/39fe4c9125a0"&gt;announcing&lt;/a&gt; the alliance with Indiegogo, Benitez described the aftermath of the June building collapse in Surfside, Florida that killed 98 people. Many people wanted to donate to help the families of the victims, and many scammers were lined up to take advantage of that generosity, Benitez wrote. But the company was able to identify and remove 23 suspicious fundraisers before they could raise any money. Campaigns the company verified raised $2.4 million to help the Surfside families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZP1Ob"&gt;While scammers in crowdfunding get a lot of the spotlight, Benitez said the focus for GoFundMe remains on building a trustworthy and safe platform. “The reality is the vast, vast majority of activity on our platform is all good people trying to do good things and trying to help each other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9lMOa"&gt;Haines says that in addition to creating more transparency about how crowdfunding campaigns are run, he sees Indiegogo playing more of a role in helping entrepreneurs on its platform be more successful overall, acting as a kind of coach. “Some campaigns don’t ever raise any money,” he noted. “But we want to focus our attention on where the backers are, because that’s where the risk is, and where the money is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19prAG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s inexpensive Air Quality Monitor plays nice with Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d885_j148nEww3MILHcT1jPwsUg=/0x0:4342x2895/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70085546/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Lifestyle_Image_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The air quality monitor (right) can show information on Echo Show devices. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h3EZce"&gt;Amazon’s latest smart home device is the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-alexa-can-help-you-create-a-smarter-healthier-home"&gt;$69.99 Smart Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, a small puck around half the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;latest Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; that’s designed to keep an eye on the quality of the air in your home. It can track your home’s temperature and humidity, and the presence of dust, carbon monoxide, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc9d5A"&gt;A key selling point of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its Alexa integration. It lets you ask compatible Alexa-enabled devices for an update on the air quality of the home at any time or view trends via the Alexa app or an Echo Show device. Importantly, the Smart Air Quality Monitor’s temperature sensor can also integrate with Alexa Routines. That allows it to function as a trigger for things like smart thermostats, ceiling fans, and blinds to help control a room’s temperature. If there’s a problem, it can issue warnings via Echo devices or the Alexa app to let you know you might, for example, want to open a window.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3HO4GS0Y9rSRSDa0bMgUdhcKj_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22982161/Amazon_Smart_Air_Quality_Monitor_Side_View_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The device itself is fairly unassuming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQB5Cz"&gt;Outside of the Alexa integration, one of the biggest appeals of the Smart Air Quality Monitor is its relatively affordable price. It’s cheaper than the $89 Awair Glow C air quality sensing smart plug &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707146/awair-glow-c-smart-plug-air-sensor-nightlight-combo-review-price-specs-features"&gt;we tried out in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and almost half the price of &lt;a href="https://www.netatmo.com/en-us/aircare/homecoach"&gt;Netatmo’s popular Smart Indoor Air Quality Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, which usually retails for $119.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qn6SyQ"&gt;Air quality is an increasing area of focus of smart home manufacturers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/6/17083908/dyson-pure-cool-air-purifier-cyclone-v10-cordless-vacuum-announcement"&gt;Dyson’s latest fans&lt;/a&gt; include air filters to remove pollutants like smoke or pollen, and earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623397/google-nest-hubs-air-pollution-smoke-alert-feature"&gt;Google updated its Nest Hubs&lt;/a&gt; in parts of the US to show data on outdoor air quality. Even Ikea’s gotten in on the action with a smart air purifier that’s built into, of all things, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fnew%2Fdiscover-a-smarter-way-to-clear-the-air-with-starkvind-air-purifiers-pub4c72a520&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a side table&lt;/a&gt;, and it offers a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fvindriktning-air-quality-sensor-60515911%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F3%2F22761003%2Famazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standalone air quality sensor&lt;/a&gt;. The ideal smart home has traditionally been one that’s well-lit and efficiently heated, but increasingly it’s one with good air quality as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TZV1e"&gt;Amazon’s Smart Air Quality Monitor is available to preorder today in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK for $69.99 / £69.99 / €79.99 and is scheduled to ship in December.&lt;/p&gt;
