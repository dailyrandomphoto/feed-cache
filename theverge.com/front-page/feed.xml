    <title>Valve says the Steam Deck is on track to ship by the end of February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETpTiJuB49MY5PTDMHd-z1S9s2w=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385660/steam_deck_hades.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKtGPY"&gt;In November, Valve gave everyone some bad news, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;revealing a two-month delay for the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s starting off 2022 on a better note. &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1675180/announcements/detail/3122683923029138793"&gt;In its latest update&lt;/a&gt;, the company says it “looks like” Steam Deck shipments will start by the end of February. Of course, we’re in a pandemic, and things can always change, but the preorder windows for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers are holding steady with their original projections — you can check your status &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="K30FOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy January! We have a small update for you today -  tl;dr - we're still on track to ship in February.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Check it out here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pQXC101JCV"&gt;https://t.co/pQXC101JCV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steam Deck (@OnDeck) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/status/1481754241182044160?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JlAaW4"&gt;Just as important as the hardware, however, is the games that you’ll try to play on the thing. Valve apparently shipped out “hundreds” of Steam Deck units to developers last month so that they can make sure their PC games are fully compatible with its software environment and AMD-powered hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ed9Gy"&gt;Testing is required to get a green&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733408/steam-deck-compatibility-verified-pc-gaming-valve"&gt; “verified” checkmark in Steam&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve already seen posts on social media showing the makers of the most popular titles trying their games out on the Steam Deck. The only thing we still don’t have, oddly, is a price for or picture of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22779252/steam-deck-things-we-learned-from-valve-developer-summit"&gt;Steam Deck dock&lt;/a&gt; that’s supposed to help you put those games on the big screen. Hopefully, we’ll get a look at that, and some time with Valve’s latest hardware project, in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Congress subpoenas Meta, Alphabet, Twitter, and Reddit over January 6th Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump Supporters Hold “Stop The Steal” Rally In DC Amid Ratification Of Presidential Election" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4U3Bc0r4dqgPNJTVDOVrwIY0RnE=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385640/1230728339.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SEYE3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-subpoenas-social-media-companies-records-related-january-6th"&gt;Congress has sent subpoenas&lt;/a&gt; demanding information from Meta (formerly Facebook), Twitter, Reddit, and Alphabet concerning the January 6th, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The House of Representatives Select Committee that’s investigating the attack wants each company to disclose moderation policy details and other information that could illuminate how participants organized their efforts or spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKePt2"&gt;The committee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652392/google-facebook-microsoft-january-6-data-request"&gt;requested records&lt;/a&gt; from dozens of companies on a voluntary basis last year, but it says the response from the aforementioned four has been “inadequate” so far. “Two key questions for the Select Committee are how the spread of misinformation and violent extremism contributed to the violent attack on our democracy, and what steps — if any — social media companies took to prevent their platforms from being breeding grounds for radicalizing people to violence. It’s disappointing that after months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary to answer those basic questions,” said committee chairman Bennie Thompson (D-MS) in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vZ5mM5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“After months of engagement, we still do not have the documents and information necessary”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SfpRUJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Alphabet%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Alphabet’s subpoena letter&lt;/a&gt; asks for information about YouTube, which hosted livestreams of the attack but also suspended former President Donald Trump for inciting violence during it. It claims Alphabet has “significant undisclosed information” concerning how it developed and reviewed its moderation and demonetization rules, as well as details about how it developed policies around false election claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUlHvr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Twitter%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Twitter’s letter&lt;/a&gt; says the company hasn’t released details of warnings it received about extremists organizing on its platform or “internal company analyses of misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation” relating to the election. It’s also supposed to deliver more information about its decision to suspend Trump’s account on January 8th. Twitter declined to comment on the subpoena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QURmYX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Zuckerberg%20re%20Meta%20Document%20Production%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;Meta is supposed to&lt;/a&gt; produce documents about its decision to disband a team that dealt with election misinformation as well as “critical internal and external analyses conducted by the company regarding misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation relating to the 2020 election, efforts to challenge or overturn the election, and the use of Meta by domestic violent extremists to affect the 2020 election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmX6Oi"&gt;Reddit, which has by far the smallest of the platforms involved, &lt;a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-1-13.BGT%20Letter%20to%20Reddit%20-%20Cover%20Letter%20and%20Schedule_Redacted.pdf"&gt;has been asked&lt;/a&gt; to commit to a “thorough review of its records” that could reveal details about whether it played a role in the attack. “We received the subpoena and will continue to work with the committee on their requests,” Reddit said in a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Sandra Chu.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC proposes new data breach rules for phone companies </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bXnEr5kcWkacDye7YHqmHrSEAS0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385426/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Jb3dz"&gt;Phone companies could have to follow new rules about how they notify customers and the government following a data breach if a proposal from the Federal Communication Commission’s chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel passes. The &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements"&gt;notice of proposed rulemaking&lt;/a&gt;, released on Wednesday, cites the “increasing frequency and severity of security breaches involving customer information” as a risk to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cC9s2f"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/47/64.2011"&gt;The current rules&lt;/a&gt; give telecommunication providers seven business days to notify the FBI and Secret Service of data breaches that leak customer proprietary network information, or CPNI. In most cases, the company cannot notify customers about the breach until seven business days after information has been relayed to federal law enforcement. The proposal suggests doing away with that mandatory waiting period and adds the FCC to the list of agencies that companies will have to notify in the case of a data breach. It also says that they would have to send out notifications even in the case of inadvertent breaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RmtJqp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;News of a breach currently has to go to law enforcement before it can be sent to consumers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ExrEv"&gt;CPNI is “some of the most sensitive personal information that carriers and providers have about their customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/general/customer-privacy"&gt;according to the FCC&lt;/a&gt;. It can include data like who a customer made calls to and when and where those calls were made. It can also include customers’ billing account name, phone and account number, and info about their plan. The proposed update would “better align the Commission’s rules” with the ones that have recently been put in place for other industries by federal and state governments, according to the notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8Fphs"&gt;This proposal isn’t being made in a vacuum. In late December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22857619/t-mobile-cyberattack-data-breach-december-2021-cpni-sim-swap"&gt;news broke&lt;/a&gt; that a data breach had exposed some T-Mobile customers’ CPNI. The carrier had also suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22646439/t-mobile-data-breach-ceo-security-mandiant-kpmg"&gt;much larger cybersecurity incident&lt;/a&gt; earlier in 2021, which affected over 50 million people and was already the carrier’s fifth breach in four years. While T-Mobile says it informed affected customers after the December breach, the FCC’s proposed rules would’ve placed stricter requirements on how and when those notifications went out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lysvz5"&gt;It may be a while before we see these requirements actually apply to phone companies — the FCC is currently in a political deadlock, with two Democrat members (including Rosenworcel) and two Republican members. The White House has nominated Gigi Sohn to fill the commission’s fifth seat, which would tip the scales, but there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22876628/fcc-biden-ftc-gigi-sohn-alvaro-bedoya-rosenworcel-net-neutrality"&gt;currently a stalemate with the Senate&lt;/a&gt; on actually getting her confirmed. Even if the Senate manages to confirm Sohn despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787261/biden-fcc-net-neutrality-jessica-rosenworcel-gigi-sohn-broadband"&gt;some Republican senators’ vows to block her nomination&lt;/a&gt;, the proposal is just the beginning of the rule-changing process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Second Life joins the metaverse discussion with the return of its founder — and some key patents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="POUR ILLUSTRER LE PAPIER : “ENTRETIENS D" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gTqvK5kaKs90AHrc1ANCF8RJsI=/12x0:3500x2325/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385420/103009616.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A recruiter works on a computer, 19 June 2007 at the cyber cafe “Le Milk” in Paris, during the Neo Job-Meeting (NJM) event, the first virtual job fair on the 3-D “Second Life” on-line game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt; | Photo credit should read STEPHANE DE SAKUTIN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9jd8Zv"&gt;Throughout months of metaverse hype, with all the new names and virtual real estate speculation, I can’t count how many times I’ve thought, “Didn’t &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; already do that?” Apparently, the people behind &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;agree and are trying to pull our attention back to their virtual world that (rather helpfully) exists somewhere you can visit on your existing computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="YV74BM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BIG NEWS!   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HighFidelityXR?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HighFidelityXR&lt;/a&gt; Invests in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SecondLife?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SecondLife&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/philiprosedale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@philiprosedale&lt;/a&gt; Returns as an Advisor, Along with Key &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Metaverse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Metaverse&lt;/a&gt; Assets to Help Fuel Growth. Read the full announcement   &lt;a href="https://t.co/WqPS4V9WPv"&gt;https://t.co/WqPS4V9WPv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— High Fidelity (@HighFidelityXR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HighFidelityXR/status/1481629589356961799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcQeB0"&gt;A strengthened “commitment to growing an innovative, inclusive, and diverse metaverse” includes &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;founder Philip Rosedale rejoining the project as a strategic adviser. After launching &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt;, he’s been involved in a number of other efforts, popping up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/11/1/2529670/coffee-power-launch"&gt;a virtual marketplace&lt;/a&gt; for people to sell their skills and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/22/5536914/second-life-creator-wants-to-look-inside-your-brain-with-oculus-rift"&gt;a neuroscience collaboration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAd2bs"&gt;However, his VR project High Fidelity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/19/5732386/high-fidelity-philip-rosendale-telepresence-second-life-hands-on"&gt;a telepresence-focused experiment&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/high-fidelity-shifts-focus-towards-non-vr-due-slow-growth/"&gt;took a step back from developing its tech for head-mounted displays&lt;/a&gt;, will invest in &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; owner Linden Research with cash and “distributed computing patents.” Speaking to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/second-life-founder-returns-to-revamp-his-original-metaverse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Rosedale said High Fidelity is shifting seven people to work on Second Life. The deal also includes patents, like two covering community moderation in decentralized environments. As we’ve seen with companies like TiVo and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16058868/apple-nokia-patent-dispute-settlement-2-billion-dollars"&gt;Nokia&lt;/a&gt;, an early presence in a space could include ownership over technology that becomes much more valuable later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jMCAIA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TiVo receives $215 million patent settlement from AT&amp;amp;amp;T ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/3/2680505/tivo-receives-215-million-patent-settlement-from-at-t"},{"title":"TiVo to merge with Xperi to create ‘one of the largest licensing companies in the world’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029945/tivo-xperi-merger-dvr-rovi-deal-patent-licensing"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="LQ8mad"&gt;Linden Research launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/18/13501492/linden-lab-project-sansar-vr-second-life-hands-on"&gt;Sansar&lt;/a&gt;, a VR successor to Second Life, a few years ago but sold the project in 2020 to focus on its main title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZkplx"&gt;An executive with Linden said to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/second-life-founder-returns-to-take-on-the-metaverse-11642080602"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that upgrades for &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;would focus on tweaking the social and economic aspects of the game to try and drive user growth. However, they also noted that Second Life already allows withdrawing money from in-game sales to their real-world accounts and thinks it can win over younger users with better avatars and a lack of the kind of ad tracking platform we associate with Meta / Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaSZ49"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; launched in 2003, and Rosedale admitted to its technological limitations, like its inability to have more than 100 or so people in one space, but tells &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt; that its current state could serve as an advantage over what VR-first “metaverse” projects are trying to build. Besides skepticism of NFTs and pie-in-the-sky ideas about interoperable platforms, he suggests that making &lt;em&gt;Second Life&lt;/em&gt; usable via phone or using your webcam to animate your avatar’s facial animation would help it grow more than anything that requires users to wear a virtual reality headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wvjr4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is the metaverse, and do I have to care?  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>What works (and doesn’t) in an NFT-backed newsletter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dirt logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxDyEhLiHbe34ycS0G7zbop7YYc=/0x37:1100x770/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385295/a362f39e_fef1_4405_b57c_15edb00cf790_7230x9000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirtdao" target="_blank"&gt;Silphwave / Dirt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPyZc1"&gt;Funding a media outlet is a tricky business, and in recent years, some journalists have looked toward the cryptocurrency world to do it. That includes &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, an entertainment newsletter co-founded by Kyle Chayka and Daisy Alioto in late 2020. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/10/think-of-it-as-a-kickstarter-tote-bag-but-much-much-better-dirt-an-entertainment-newsletter-is-funding-itself-with-nfts-not-subscriptions/"&gt;raised money since launch&lt;/a&gt; by selling non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-introducing-dirtdao"&gt;it announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to work those NFTs into a decentralized autonomous organization or DAO — giving its audience input into where &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; spends its money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJR3iq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first blockchain-based media outfit. In 2017, for instance, a project called Civil funded a panoply of websites using its own cryptocurrency token. But &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/02/media-startup-civil-shuts-down-team-absorbed-into-decentralized-id-efforts-at-consensys/"&gt;Civil collapsed&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/how-civil-didnt-37037075"&gt;a difficult launch&lt;/a&gt; and initial funding that quickly ran dry. Meanwhile, lots of cryptocurrency enthusiasts have created DAOs where token owners can vote like shareholders in a business, but many are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820563/constitution-meme-47-million-crypto-crowdfunding-blockchain-ethereum-constitution"&gt;chaotic experiments like ConstitutionDAO&lt;/a&gt;, an attempt to buy a copy of the US Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1N5CM"&gt;Kyle Chayka readily describes DirtDAO as an experiment, but it’s got a comparatively modest goal: letting a small community vote on pitches for future &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; longform stories. On January 14th, it will conduct its first vote with people who previously bought one of its NFTs, which are minted on the Ethereum blockchain. (Ethereum is a common choice for NFT creators, but it’s currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;more environmentally damaging&lt;/a&gt; than some alternatives.) In advance of the sale, I spoke with Chayka about the promise — and the limits — of using DAOs for journalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tTIcY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interview has been condensed and edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4T7Sf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The announcement describes DirtDAO letting token holders vote on stories and shape the editorial process. I’m curious what the extent of that is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4P7Tw"&gt;How we’re dealing with the token voting is that Daisy [Alioto] is working with writers who we’ve already worked with, who we’ve already published in &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; and who we’re familiar with. And then she’s coming up with a slate of stories that we know that we would be happy to run. I’m not sure how many we’re doing right now, but maybe like five or six options. And then the token holders will be able to vote doing ranked choice on those options. So in the end, they’re all stories that we would be happy to run and writers we would be happy to work with. The input is, what do the token holders wants to prioritize? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrOx0v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the obvious question for me is, why not run a crowdfunded, non-crypto system that lets backers vote on coverage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fH5E4"&gt;To me, the biggest benefit of blockchain stuff here is the record-keeping. So essentially, by creating a token, we have a really easy way of looking at who has supported us, like who has participated in funding &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt;, essentially. And then that record also means that the token holders can express their interest by voting really easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra7GH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you theoretically don’t know who owns the tokens, how do you prevent some company from buying up all your tokens and using that to influence your editorial process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFq2Ph"&gt;We’re doing this experiment in order to figure out those questions. But at this point, &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is small enough and the token holders are small enough that we essentially know who everyone is, at least by their wallet, even if they’re anonymous. I think the point is here that it’s small-scale enough that we do want to know who our token holders are at this point, and we do want to make sure that they’re committed and are acting in a moral way. So in that way, it’s not trustless — but I don’t think our experiment here is about reaching a huge scale or claiming that blockchain can do everything or run an entire company. It’s just a way for readers to express what they want for our publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFDcoU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say you know people, does that mean you know their literal identities or know them as something like consistent user handles?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78I5Qz"&gt;I’d say probably 60 or 70 percent of the people who are actually participating, we know them by name and we know their internet presences and stuff. And we have other token holders and NFT collectors who are pseudonymous or we just know their [crypto] wallet. But actually, the pseudonymous people or totally anonymous people don’t tend to participate as much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUjVw4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It says in the announcement post that around 100 people have tokens at this point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOBMV"&gt;Yeah, I think now it’s about 130. I expect a small portion of those to actually vote. I don’t think that every token holder is going to vote by any means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ScfyR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a maximum number of people that you feel like could be involved in voting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oJijY"&gt;Someone asked us about this the other day, and I think somewhere around a thousand people — I don’t expect more than a thousand people to be actively voting because in our experience, a very, very small number of readers actually want to participate in governance. Like, governance is just not something that a lot of people want to do. They want to consume content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpcFnd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say you have a pitch with sensitive information — like in an extreme example, there’s an assault allegation that you don’t want to make public outside a small editorial process. How would you handle DAO members voting on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zR6E8Q"&gt;There’s a few reasons that this works for us. And one of the reasons is that the DAO-voted features are not our only features — like, this is not our entire editorial process. This is one part of the editorial process, kind of like a column or recurring feature that’s sponsored by the DAO and the token holders. So we’re certainly allowing ourselves to do pieces that don’t go through this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8STgX"&gt;But also I think this DAO structure and the whole mechanism works for &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; particularly because we’re not doing investigative reporting. We’re doing criticism and commentary and aggregation about entertainment online. I would personally not want a publication driven by crypto that’s trying to do like, sexual assault investigations, as you said, or more consequential political reporting, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78qtMI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the things Civil was interested in was having a censorship-proof record of journalism actually on the blockchain. How viable do you think that is?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XYMko"&gt;It’s not something that we’re dealing with or proposing at all. Our publishing is not really blockchain-connected — like, the newsletter itself just runs on Substack like any other Substack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npeeoH"&gt;I think what is interesting to me is less about how the writing is censor-proof than the kind of funding and decision-making that we’re doing will be public. So at this point, you could actually see every transaction that &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;has gotten funding from, so you could see the exact amount of money that we’ve made. You can see who holds our tokens, who holds our NFTs. And once the DAO votes start, you’ll be able to see how every vote happens, who voted for what. So those will all be more or less permanent records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjnUGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say “who voted for what,” you mean linked with wallets, which don’t necessarily tell you who owns the wallet or who is behind it, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBpczS"&gt;In our case, the majority of the token holders do connect their wallet to their real name, because they also are proud to participate and want to show their support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uq3yxS"&gt;To be very clear, I don’t think this use case works in every situation at all. I think it works because we engage with digital culture. We don’t do super hard-hitting journalism. And the process is about having fun determining the stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGldIi"&gt;I think there could be ways to apply this technology to other editorial processes that would work on investigative features or similar things like that. To me, the permanent record-keeping of blockchain is interesting. I don’t see that being applied in terms of censorship-proof writing that soon, personally. I do think it is interesting to see the governance votes and see the funding mechanisms. So I see it right now, more as a back-end for media production, and less about the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9880Xi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why specifically use Ethereum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wr3jxJ"&gt;Ethereum is the furthest along in terms of utility for cryptocurrencies. Like, things like Snapshot, which helps you do governance, work on Ethereum-built currencies, and OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, most of the transactions are in Ethereum. &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; actually started on the publishing platform Mirror, which also uses Ethereum-backed stuff. So the short answer is, the tools are there for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="davzDD"&gt;I am definitely a big fan of less environmentally impactful blockchain technologies, and I think we would love to see Ethereum go to layer two and use less energy. But I also think &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; in the near future will move to a less heavy blockchain like Solana or Tezos. My impression is that the record-keeping is kind of the same — Ethereum versus Solana versus Tezos versus whatever, they’re all public records, they’re all on a chain somewhere. And so I’m not sure that the Ethereum label itself will be as valuable in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jDGtY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re selling these DAO tokens, it’s more or less a one-time payment for each token. If you want to keep getting funding, do you just have to keep selling more tokens?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azR9W0"&gt;One ideal model that I’ve thought of is essentially like if Bored Ape Yacht Club was a media company — right now, they’re making millions of dollars a month on secondary sales royalties [for NFT transfers]. So there is a world in which &lt;em&gt;Dirt &lt;/em&gt;could run solely on secondary market royalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RKfRL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That seems like it might require having a pretty heavy turnover in the user base that’s engaged enough to want to vote on these things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0ZRY0"&gt;I think there’s an interesting comparison — like, the readers of a publication don’t stay the same over time. People are always cycling in and out. So I would expect that there would be some people who are in it for the long haul, definitely plenty of turnover, maybe someone buys some tokens and wants to vote for a few weeks and then gets bored of it and sells them. That would be fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EaDV3i"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the big criticisms of NFT systems is that they just rely on constant expansion for funding. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYDsWz"&gt;We don’t want to go the way of constant expansion. I think our ideal situation would be patrons who want to keep participating in the long term and using their tokens and helping us fund ourselves in whatever way we choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saMd3l"&gt;I think the constant expansion is only necessary if you want to operate on a large scale like Bored Ape Yacht Club or something similar. I see a situation in which each editorial initiative could have its own token or own NFT, and then once that funding runs out, you do a different one. So it kind of becomes like special issues, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgXGqY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that would be separate from DAO voting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK3frY"&gt;Right — it could be. We can experiment with different mechanisms for different projects, and that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anything with &lt;em&gt;Dirt&lt;/em&gt; is permanent. These are experiments that we’ll do, and then see how they work and then try something slightly different. And just repeat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activity data from wearables could help monitor blood sugar levels, study indicates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fitbit-Charge-2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QJkM5HBA0jDPJ5QT336DN4Gzq2Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70385193/verge-2016-09-21_14-23-23.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zzy62B"&gt;Activity data from a Fitbit can predict changes in blood sugar control for adults with prediabetes, a condition that affects around one in three adults in the United States, a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-021-00541-1.pdf"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; shows. The findings point to a strategy that tech companies might use in their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22850147/movano-ring-smart-ring-chronic-illnesses-ces-2022"&gt;efforts&lt;/a&gt; to build diabetes technology into wearable products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDBiTb"&gt;“It kind of makes sense intuitively — more movement, more physical activity leads to overall better health, and better health is one of the factors behind improved glycemic control,” says Jessilyn Dunn, an assistant professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University who wasn’t involved with this study but has also done work on wearables and glucose monitoring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zwPRPP"&gt;People with prediabetes have elevated blood sugar levels, placing them at risk of developing diabetes. But most tools that predict whether someone with prediabetes will progress to develop diabetes look years in the future, says study author Mitesh Patel, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and vice president for Clinical Transformation at hospital group Ascension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo1xPP"&gt;“There were no good near-term models to say, in the next six months, whose blood sugar is going to increase and get worse versus whose is going to get better,” Patel says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hY8NHK"&gt;In the new study, published in &lt;em&gt;NPJ Digital Medicine&lt;/em&gt;, Patel’s team built models that would use activity data collected from either wrist- or waist-worn Fitbits to predict both changes in average blood sugar and 5 percent improved or worsened blood sugar levels. Over the course of the six-month study, they found that they were able to make accurate predictions, and that predictions were more accurate using data collected from the wrist-worn devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdV7K2"&gt;“We know that people who are generally more active have better control of their blood sugar, and people who are less active have worse control,” Patel says. “But there are other hidden patterns in the daily information we’re getting — how many steps are fast steps versus slow steps, and other nuances — that we can get from this information.” Because the wearable can capture that additional data, it can give a more granular look at how activity drives changes in blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olYMZS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34079049/"&gt;Other studies&lt;/a&gt; have also found that data from wearable devices can help track and predict blood glucose levels. But that despite those relationships, activity and other wearable data is still only a proxy for blood sugar levels, Dunn says. It’s still important to directly monitor blood sugar through blood testing methods until there’s more evidence to show that the links are strong enough to make treatment decisions. This new study was in under 200 people, for example, and only looked at people with prediabetes — more work would be needed to test the relationship in more people and at varying levels of health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wFCM"&gt;Tech companies are looking toward diabetes and blood sugar management as the next set of tools to incorporate into consumer-facing products like smartwatches and smart rings. Apple has been looking into noninvasive glucose monitoring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652120/apple-watch-blood-pressure-temperature-sleep-diabetes"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit has a &lt;a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/tech/fitbit-moves-deeper-into-healthcare-lifescan-deal-to-combine-diabetes-devices-consumer"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; with diabetes tech company LifeScan, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22850147/movano-ring-smart-ring-chronic-illnesses-ces-2022"&gt;new smart ring&lt;/a&gt; is looking to blood sugar monitoring as a future goal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxR4op"&gt;These companies want to find ways to measure blood sugar without breaking the skin — their attempts have focused on &lt;a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/diabetes-glucose-monitor-5208728"&gt;sweat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.mendosa.com/The%20Pursuit%20of%20Noninvsive%20Glucose,%20Fourth%20Edition.pdf"&gt;tears, breath, and the reflection of light&lt;/a&gt; off the skin. Those strategies could offer more direct measures of glucose than activity data, but most haven’t come to fruition yet, Dunn says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYuQp9"&gt;Dunn says she could imagine that, in the short term, tech companies might build in features that use activity data to give people some type of information about their blood sugar. Then, if the other, noninvasive strategies that more directly measure glucose levels prove to work well, those might be the next-gen tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiaoJ5"&gt;“And so, then the question becomes, what is the next technology?” Dunn says. “And I think that remains to be seen — but we can be sure there will be something.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Android 12 update has been the rockiest in years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gJdXwUYhlaEif8Ydo9DpPzXcSUM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384996/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From bugs to halted releases, Android 12 has seen an unusually troubled launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There are some unique complicating factors this year, but it’s the same old Android — the good and the bad&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hLnFwe"&gt;Android 12 is one of the platform’s most ambitious updates in recent history, bringing a major design overhaul to every corner of the operating system. It has also been one of the rockiest Android OS launches in the past few years. Both Samsung and OnePlus paused the rollout of their stable Android 12-based updates amid reports of serious bugs. Google itself has addressed a laundry list of bug reports from Pixel 6 owners, just as it’s trying to convince them it’s finally figured out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;how to build a truly premium phone&lt;/a&gt;. What in the heck is going on? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTkjK4"&gt;The short answer is that there are some unique complicating factors at play this year but also that Android is inherently a little bit messy — that just comes with the territory when you’re designing a delightful public park compared to Apple’s walled garden.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Despite a refreshed look and some appealing new high-end handsets, Android is still Android — the good and the bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NFObXS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zGyqPg"&gt;Android 12’s release started predictably enough with a formal announcement at Google I/O in May 2021. After that, the timeline looks a little different from previous years. A full stable release came a month later than usual, on October 4th, 2021. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro launched later that month with Android 12 pre-loaded. A handful of bugs were to be expected, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22832212/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-bug-fixes-fingerprint-sensor"&gt;Google’s December Pixel update included dozens of fixes&lt;/a&gt; despite Google having that extra month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CKzuTq"&gt;Even worse, the December patch itself proved problematic as some Pixel 6 owners complained about network connection problems worsened by the update. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused"&gt;halted the update&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/04/google-delists-december-2021-update-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;removed it from its archive&lt;/a&gt; to prevent manual downloads. When asked, the company didn’t offer an explanation for the problematic update but &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"&gt;pointed to a statement&lt;/a&gt; that a fix is coming in late January that will include all of the bug fixes planned for the December patch.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 owners are still waiting for the bug fixes initially slated for the December update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUxGBh"&gt;Google’s not alone in having trouble with its new OS. Samsung users in South Korea &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-issues-after-android-12-update"&gt;reported serious problems&lt;/a&gt; with their Galaxy Fold 3 and Flip 3 devices after installing the One UI 4.0 (Android 12) stable release, including flickering displays and bricked phones. Samsung acknowledged the problem and &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%ED%8C%81/4%EC%B0%A8-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80-%EC%86%8C%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8-%EA%B3%B5%EC%A7%80-12-13/td-p/14321413"&gt;responded initially by releasing a fourth &lt;em&gt;beta&lt;/em&gt; version&lt;/a&gt; of the software to fix bugs introduced by the stable release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK2MKt"&gt;OnePlus’ stable release wasn’t so stable, either: its Android 12 skin was so buggy that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828553/oneplus-buggy-oxygenos-android-12-update-9-pro"&gt;the company paused its release&lt;/a&gt;, like Google, after it was widely criticized. In a brief statement, OnePlus explained that the fact this release marked the company’s attempt to integrate its OxygenOS and ColorOS codebases into the same build “led to the software experience not being smooth” and that its software team “collected the Community’s feedback and released a new build of OxygenOS 12 within a week to deliver a better user experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XpqlCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r5oEEP"&gt;In each case, these “stable” releases were anything but, and none of these companies offered much detail about what went wrong. To try and figure out what the heck is going on, we talked to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, former editor-in-chief of &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, who’s well known for digging into Android codebases and discovering Google’s secrets. Speaking to the Pixel 6 bugs in particular, Rahman guesses that it has a lot to do with the unusually large size of the update. “Many people have called it, myself included, the biggest OS update to Android since Android 5.0 Lollipop, and that was many years ago. There are just so many massive changes to the interface and to the feature set.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kEJAy"&gt;He also suggests that Google’s commitment to issue a new Android update every year can make things worse when it’s trying to do so much, and the self-imposed one-year development cycle doesn’t leave much wiggle room in the timeline. “They started immediately after Android 11 was released to the public — and they have a hard cutoff date… After that, they just focus on fixing bugs.” Delay any longer, and they’d risk bumping into next year’s development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5arqlH"&gt;It’s also possible that the attempt to bring timely Android updates to non-Google devices wound up backfiring. Android phone owners have been asking for faster updates for a long time — outside of Google’s Pixel phones and pricey flagships, many devices face long waits for OS updates. Sure enough, the updates have come faster this year. Case in point: Samsung users are accustomed to waiting about three months after an Android stable release to get their finished One UI update with the new version of the OS, but this year, One UI 4.0 arrived just one and a half months after Android 12. But the way things have gone this year, many users would likely have opted for a slower, stable update rather than a fast one riddled with bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpBnqN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oxxR5"&gt;OnePlus, by its own admission, faced unique complications as it attempted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;merge Oppo’s ColorOS and OxygenOS&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it incorporated Android 12’s changes. That’s a recipe for bugs, Rahman explains. “Devices that are upgrading from Android 11 with OxygenOS 11 to OxygenOS 12 are having a lot of settings and features being migrated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V76dpX"&gt;To illustrate the problem, he describes a bug that some Realme device owners have encountered: users who restore settings from an old Android phone when setting up a Realme device would sometimes find the &lt;a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/cant-disable-night-filter.4005543/"&gt;Night Light setting constantly enabled on their new phone&lt;/a&gt;. This happened because of a mismatch between Realme and Google’s open-source implementations of Night Light. OxygenOS 12, he suspects, suffered from similar issues. “It’s those kinds of bugs that are plaguing this update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTYtaG"&gt;While it’s still hard to understand how &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/oxygen-os12-oneplus-9-awful/"&gt;an update as buggy&lt;/a&gt; as OnePlus’ initial OxygenOS 12 release earned a “stable” designation, it makes a little more sense when you account for the huge challenge of merging two codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hw5WUE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eSzGYc"&gt;While all of these factors likely contributed to an unusually troubled release, the underlying problem is a familiar one. By its nature, Android is a fragmented ecosystem. There’s no straight line from Android 12 to the Galaxy S21 or OnePlus 9 — every major update sees handoffs between the manufacturer, carriers, and Google, all of which result in delays. Initiatives like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/12/15632552/android-o-faster-updates-project-treble-google"&gt;Project Treble&lt;/a&gt; seem to have helped speed up some parts of the process, but unless Google takes some drastic actions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;nobody can completely fix the problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rViwDT"&gt;While OEMs and Google push to get updates out faster, they’ve also made a push to produce more attention-grabbing, premium devices. OnePlus appears to be separating its “flagships, but cheaper” ethos into two different realms: “flagships” like the 9 Pro and separate “cheaper” phones a la the Nord series. Samsung is making a serious attempt to bring foldables into the mainstream. Google has positioned the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro as true flagships, with custom processors and a design language that’s more polished and less quirky than previous generations. This buggy OS rollout risks taking some of the shine off of the polished image these device makers are hoping to cultivate — in fact, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?s=20"&gt;damage may already be done&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FNT5vl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Pixel 6 Pro has slowly gotten so buggy since launch in October that I can no longer recommend it at $900. Combined with the latest botched  update it's just been a bad experience. My SIM is back in an S21 Ultra til the next review.&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1481108783996751874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qBFeb9"&gt;It’s a shame because they’ve succeeded with the hardware. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;two of the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus’ ambition to create a true flagship competitor has resulted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"&gt;a refined product that’s the genuine article&lt;/a&gt;. And this time around, Samsung seems to have succeeded at making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;a foldable phone&lt;/a&gt; that has captured the attention of more than just tech geeks. But behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times. That’s easier to forgive on a midrange or budget phone, but it’s tough to stomach from a premium device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ru4JHg"&gt;It’s unlikely, though, that this unusually troubled release will sway significant numbers of people to bail on Android; as painful as some of these bugs have been, they’re probably not enough to push users over the hurdles of jumping ship to Apple. Rahman thinks that in most cases, the ecosystem lock-in is too strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5k5rtS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;behind the glossy hardware, the software experience can still be uneven at times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zaz9Vh"&gt;“You’d lose out on so many apps and services that you pay for. If you have other devices that interact with your smartphone, you’d lose access to that, or that access would be diminished in some way. I don’t see it as a significant factor convincing people to turn away from a particular device.” Those barriers exist on Apple’s side as well, of course. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;Recently surfaced emails&lt;/a&gt; from Apple executives imply that iMessage remains exclusive to iPhones as a mechanism to keep Apple users with Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ONg9Or"&gt;Apple has also had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20872972/apple-ios-13-review-iphone-update-dark-mode-arcade-maps-photos-siri"&gt;its share of software stumbles&lt;/a&gt;, to be sure. But it’s generally a more predictable experience — if you’re willing to live within the boundaries of that walled garden. And there’s the flipside of Android’s fragmented existence: there’s no single entity dictating the hardware and software. In Apple’s ecosystem, you get what it deems to be the right features at the right time, and that’s that. Foldables? Maybe in a few years. A rainbow of customizable system colors? Forget it. Life is a little more interesting — if, at times, unpredictable and uneven — outside of the garden walls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles in-store to Pro members on January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eN2ioVcq2QU3reuVTBM5NjfS2AE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70384866/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 will be available in select GameStop stores as a part of a bundle.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OF7ua"&gt;GameStop PowerUp Rewards Pro members still on the hunt for the ever-elusive PlayStation 5 may have another shot at nabbing the console. Once again, GameStop is selling PlayStation 5 bundles tomorrow, January 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIOH2S"&gt;The retailer has announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its first special in-store PlayStation 5 sales event&lt;/a&gt; of this year will take place in select stores on Friday, January 14th. To participate, you must have &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22604013%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/poweruprewards/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a subscription to GameStop’s Pro membership&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for $14.99 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhtI6"&gt;The standard PlayStation 5, which offers a disc drive, typically retails for $499.99. However, as GameStop will be selling pre-built bundles, you should expect to pay more than that. An &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;image published by GameStop&lt;/a&gt; also suggests the less expensive $399.99 PS5 Digital Edition could also be available as a part of a bundle, although this hasn’t been confirmed. For the unfamiliar, the Digital Edition is a console that shares identical specs but doesn’t have an optical drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8wssw"&gt;While we don’t know what will be inside the exact contents of the bundle yet, historically, these tend to contain PS5 games and GameStop gift cards, as well as other accessories like extra controllers or chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDJ0Rl"&gt;To land the console, you’ll have to visit a local GameStop store, which &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fps5-store-event.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can find using the company’s store locator tool here&lt;/a&gt;. While the event will probably start at each store’s opening time, it’s likely many will start lining up long before this, so prepare to wake up early. It’s advisable to check if your local branch is participating in the event beforehand, too, if possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng6742"&gt;While this event is being hosted at several locations, GameStop has indicated that quantities will be limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtABtw"&gt;If you don’t manage to pick up one tomorrow, keep checking back. We will continue posting updates as more restocks happen to make sure you will.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X are available right now for Walmart Plus subscribers (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hlNr08zeaUX12iagwr-22yVLtwI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70379557/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4C9oZp"&gt;In case you hadn’t noticed, it’s becoming ever-so-slightly less of a maddening exercise to get your hands on a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Granted, it’s still harder than it should be, but recent retailer restocks have taken longer to sell out than they used to. So, here’s hoping that you’re able to purchase whichever console you want &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fearlyaccess&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;during today’s restock at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is specifically for paid Walmart Plus subscribers and going on right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJbH1G"&gt;Walmart is offering the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 PS5 with a disc drive&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$399.99 PS5 console that can only play digital titles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X-Video-Game-Console-Black%2F443574645%3Fathbdg%3DL1100&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. These consoles are available to non-trial Walmart Plus members, meaning you actually have to opt-in to pay Walmart for the service to get access (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Faccount%2Fplus%2Foverview&amp;amp;sharedid=vergerestock01132022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here’s where you can sign up for Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt;). Though, Walmart is calling these “early access” deals, perhaps suggesting that they’ll open up to non-Plus customers after a window of time. In the past, the window of exclusivity has been three hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEO0nO"&gt;To ease the checkout process, make sure you have your shipping and payment info ready to go ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mdeeQD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10971562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="I0pbDz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10297750"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GyhutA"&gt;Some essentials for PS5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gahs20"&gt;In case you plan to get lucky with buying a console today, there are several excellent games and accessories that we recommend. Starting with games, head over to this list to see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22825859/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-2021"&gt;PS5’s best games of 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="potP0F"&gt;Getting an Xbox Series X? Check out these add-ons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3yJrjt"&gt;If you’re on team Xbox, you may already know about Game Pass Ultimate, which gives you discounts and access to an ever-expanding catalog of Game Pass games, along with online multiplayer. You may never need to pay full price for a game for your new console.
