    <title>Intel hopes to start making chips for car companies within six to nine months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXdULp"&gt;Intel could start producing in-demand semiconductors for car companies within six to nine months, CEO Pat Gelsinger said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, commenting that the chipmaking is already being discussed with companies that design chips for cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkQqjE"&gt;“We’re hoping that some of these things can be alleviated, not requiring a three- or four-year factory build, but maybe six months of new products being certified on some of our existing processes,” &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2BZ2C4"&gt;Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m796lz"&gt;Even if Intel is unable to meet that six to nine month goal, the news highlights the importance that Intel is placing on its new business as a producer of chips for other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GpZjLI"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “We’ve begun those engagements already with some of the key components suppliers.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0cJuP6"&gt;Gelsinger unveiled the new business — called Intel Foundry Services — as a “standalone foundry business unit” last month at his “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.intel.com/news-releases/idm-manufacturing-innovation-product-leadership/"&gt;Engineering the Future&lt;/a&gt;” announcement, with promises that the company would put its fabs to work producing x86, Arm, and RISC-V core chips for external clients. As part of that announcement, Intel also planned to invest $20 billion into expanding its fabs in Arizona to help it better meet demand from external partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKsYs7"&gt;The automotive industry has been one of the areas that’s been hit hardest by the ongoing global semiconductor shortage, with car companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331766/gm-pickups-semiconductor-shortage-fuel-economy-emissions"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; forced to shut down production or make changes to their trucks due to a lack of parts. If Intel is able to start producing automotive chips within the year, it could provide a much-needed new avenue of supply to alleviate those shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS2dwQ"&gt;The global shortage has reached the point that the Biden administration is looking to intervene: the president has called for a review of the semiconductor supply chain in an executive order and hosted the executives of companies including Intel, Google, Ford, GM, TSMC, and Dell at the White House for today’s “CEO Summit on Semiconductor and Supply Chain Resilience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNpeTx"&gt;“We’ve been falling behind on research and development and manufacturing, and, to put it bluntly, we have to step up our game,” Biden said at the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyndryl is IBM’s wacky new name for its dry IT spinoff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ibK9ox1dZb7gKtwIxZvDqWmzQUo=/40x0:1240x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115271/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wdrUBq"&gt;Meet &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibms-independent-managed-infrastructure-services-business-to-be-named-kyndryl-301266347.html"&gt;Kyndryl&lt;/a&gt; — which, despite the name, is not a new legendary pokémon or a futuristic fake pharmaceutical from &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;. No, Kyndryl is the new name for IBM’s legacy IT infrastructure business, which the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508974/ibm-split-into-two-companies-newco-hybrid-cloud-legacy-it"&gt;spinning off into a new company&lt;/a&gt; to allow the main company to focus on its newer (and more lucrative) areas of emphasis, like AI and cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z12AZW"&gt;I’ll let IBM’s press release explain: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ipQyeq"&gt; ”Kyn” is derived from the word &lt;em&gt;kinship&lt;/em&gt;, referencing the belief that relationships with people — employees, customers and partners — are at the center of the strategy, and that long-lasting relationships must be built and nurtured. “Dryl” comes from &lt;em&gt;tendril,&lt;/em&gt; bringing to mind new growth and the idea that — together with customers and partners — the business is always working toward advancing human progress.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PMCSVM"&gt;“Kinship” and “tendrils” — two of the first words that come to mind when one considers managed infrastructure services. Except, of course, with extra y’s added, “y” presumably being the letter that most conveys “the spirit of true partnership and growth” for which Kyndryl’s corporate IT setups stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaNxJ"&gt;In reality, it feels like the wholly bizarre branding is meant to be SEO bait. “NewCo” — the original placeholder for the branch of the company that is now known as Kyndryl — is the sort of name that fades into the background, while Kyndryl, bizarre as it may be, is at no danger of being confused or lost in a sea of similar Google results (mostly because there are none).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGqgzh"&gt;“Customers around the world will come to know Kyndryl as a brand that runs the vital systems at the heart of progress,” said Martin Schroeter, Kyndryl’s CEO. And with a name as... unique as the one selected here, he’s probably correct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdbqzF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Salesforce to reopen San Francisco headquarters in May </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Salesforce To Purchase Popular Messaging Platform Slack For 27 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxSAvzzmgXBHwydxCPNFUirCvGE=/0x0:3651x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115150/1229897073.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stephen Lam/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQRLwA"&gt;Salesforce said Monday that it will reopen its San Francisco headquarters in May, but its employees can still work remotely through the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu41GY"&gt;The company has already reopened 22 of its offices, according to company president and chief people officer Brent Hyder, who &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/global-return-to-the-office-the-salesforce-approach/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that Salesforce would decide how and when to reopen each location based on guidance from health officials and medical experts. “We have an opportunity to create a workspace and an employee experience that makes us even more connected, healthy, innovative and productive,” Hyder wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5EPiI"&gt;The company plans a three-phase approach for offices, with the first phase limited to US employees who live in areas where coronavirus risk is flat or declining. Salesforce will require employees to take COVID-19 tests twice a week. The second phase will see offices gradually reopening from 20 to 75 percent capacity depending on local conditions, and the third stage will be a full office reopening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpCMue"&gt;Salesforce has been redesigning its offices with COVID-19 in mind, adding plexiglass between desks, air purifiers in conference rooms, touch-free handles for doors, and temperature screening stations, as well as providing hand sanitizer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEH4xD"&gt;Salesforce is the &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/subscriber-only/2021/01/08/largest-employers-in-san-francisco.html"&gt;biggest employer in San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s return to its downtown headquarters could be a bellwether for other companies in the area. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352742/facebook-uber-microsoft-twitter-apple-covid-19-offices-reopening"&gt;Facebook also plans to return&lt;/a&gt; to in-person work at its Bay Area offices next month, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uber-reopening/uber-to-reopen-san-francisco-offices-with-limited-capacity-next-week-idUSFWN2LN0XP"&gt;Uber reopened&lt;/a&gt; its Mission Bay headquarters, at limited capacity, on March 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG Korea says that the Wing, Velvet 5G, and Velvet LTE phones will get Android 13</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1wDBuWsGUlparL02Rj8-GBW33go=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69115027/cgartenberg_201022_4254_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wing will be one of a few devices to receive OS upgrades for several years after LG exits the smartphone business.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vhTjQN"&gt;LG’s Korean website now lists which phones the company plans to update to Android 12, along with a few devices which will even get Android 13. These upgrades will most likely come long after the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/4/22346084/lg-exits-smartphone-business"&gt;mobile industry exit&lt;/a&gt;, announced last week. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/LG-Korea-reveals-which-phones-will-receive-Android-12-and-Android-13-update_id131368"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the &lt;a href="https://www.lge.co.kr/lgekor/contents/mobile/swUpgradeDetail.do?swSeq=1441"&gt;updated FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, which previously stated that some models would get the OS upgrade to 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoiLYB"&gt;According to the FAQ, the LG Wing and both variants of the Velvet (LTE and 5G) will get Android 13. LG also says that those models, along with the V50, V50S, G8, Q31, Q52, and Q92, will receive an Android 12 upgrade. The company also notes that these two updates aren’t strictly guaranteed and will depend on product performance, product stabilization level, and Google policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBwiwF"&gt;LG Korea says that an Android 11 update, already in progress, is planned for the models mentioned above, along with the Q61, Q70, and Q9 One. As an aside, the Q-series models sold throughout Europe and Asia are similar to corresponding models sold as the K-series in the US but aren’t strictly a 1:1 match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4q1Bzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"LG leaves behind more than a flip phone-shaped hole in our hearts","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s7vL90"&gt;Availability and timing of updates will, of course, vary by region, but the list is a good indication of which models the company plans to prioritize. Recently, LG’s German website &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327144/lg-android-11-software-update-wing-phones-mobile-q4-2021"&gt;published a timetable&lt;/a&gt; for its Android 11 updates, most of which won’t be released until the end of the 2021. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/1/18164265/lg-android-pie-update-g7-v40-q1-2019"&gt;isn’t known for a great track record&lt;/a&gt; on platform updates, but it’s encouraging to see specific model names mentioned for the future upgrades. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos just let me copy text from a photo into my web browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utjEgpSyqETC6T_8fROrmld19s8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114734/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVugMv"&gt;The desktop Google Photos website seems to be getting the ability to scan for text in an image and turn it into copy-and-pasteable text, thanks to Google’s Lens technology (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/11/google-lens-photos-web/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Lens has been available in many places on Android for a while, but its optical character recognition (OCR) feature coming to the desktop could make Google Photos an easy and free way to get real-life text onto your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE3m86"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, the feature seems to be rolling out widely, but a writer at &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-lens-google-photos-desktop-ocr-images/"&gt;didn’t have it show up for them&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to use it, though. To use it (or to check if you have it yet), load up the Google Photos site and go to a photo where you’ve captured some text (such as a page of a book, a sign, a receipt, etc). If Google detects words, a “Copy text from image” button should pop up, and clicking that will open a pane that lets you read the text that Google found.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fe_XHMoHp2S54SqRgagWO9KpOh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438687/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.49.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Copy text from image button will show up on images that Google finds text in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G6K85X"&gt;One practical application of having Lens on desktop could be scanning written text documents and pasting that into something you’re writing on a desktop computer. To test this, I took this picture of an open book, and the results were nearly flawless:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-OsJZ3z_tTCr5MMS5YBBTOqWwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438614/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.34.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select the text directly on the photo or use the sidebar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i6gp4K"&gt;Lens even managed to interpret an “æ” correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaSb64"&gt;Google Lens has &lt;a href="https://lens.google.com"&gt;many more abilities&lt;/a&gt; on Android (and in the iOS Google Photos app), but it seems that text-copying is the only one that’s made it to the desktop so far. The browser version of Google Photos didn’t offer to translate a picture with Spanish text (though it did let me copy the text), and it doesn’t look like it can identify things like animals or plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXXU6L"&gt;Still, it’s nice to see one of Lens’ most useful features coming to the desktop version of Google Photos, and hopefully it’s an indication that more are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for $480 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted in all color variants at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $679, which is $70 off its usual price of $749. Walmart has a sale on the iPad Air 256GB for as low as $699 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Sky-Blue%2F483096080%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Uber weed deliveries may be on the company’s roadmap — eventually</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xNZ5CG"&gt;Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/uber-ceo-says-company-could-get-into-cannabis-delivery.html"&gt;said on CNBC&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the ride-hailing company would consider getting into cannabis delivery “when the road is clear.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXuSBI"&gt;“When federal laws come into play, we’re absolutely going to take a look at it,” Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li2PCJ"&gt;Khosrowshahi made the remarks as part of a conversation about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262155/uber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates"&gt;Uber’s February acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of Boston-based alcohol delivery service Drizly. Not part of that $1.1 billion acquisition was Lantern, a cannabis delivery service Drizly launched in May 2020. Lantern continues to operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyQaG4"&gt;Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, but about three dozen US states have decriminalized the drug, either for medical or recreational purposes — some for both uses. Last month, New York passed the &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/legislation-allow-adult-use-cultivation-recreational-marijuana-advances&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_content="&gt;Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act&lt;/a&gt;, legalizing the recreational use and expunging the records of people who were convicted on marijuana-related charges that are no longer criminalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnjPz4"&gt;And although legislation to legalize marijuana at the federal level has not been successful the past several years, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260844/cannabis-legislation-congress-democrats-congress"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt; that they would work together to advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the current Congress. All three senators had previously supported legislation to decriminalize cannabis in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmPja9"&gt;Uber declined to provide additional comment about Khosrowshahi’s remarks. The CEO told CNBC that in the near future, Uber will continue to focus on building out its delivery business. “For right now with grocery, with food, with alcohol, etc., we see so much opportunity out there and we’re going to focus on the opportunity at hand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxOsdc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuLwCK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ncEaJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJz8UX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEOGd7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVeXU6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjfOOe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is burning its solar roof customers with a huge price increase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Solar Roof" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ci3EltIvzirTHcZ364DKagDptvQ=/216x0:1784x1045/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114360/tesla_solar_roof_smooth_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGb0ZG"&gt;Tesla has dramatically increased the price for its solar roof, angering some customers who have responded by canceling their orders. The news was first reported over the weekend &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/29/tesla-drastically-increases-price-solar-roof/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyeCMF"&gt;The price jumps come as Tesla reports increasing revenue from its solar business. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company installed 86 mega-watts (MW) of solar energy, a 59 percent increase year over year. For the entire year, Tesla installed 205 MW of solar energy, an 18 percent increase compared to 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnKHJ1"&gt;Tesla offers two solar products: solar panels, which are installed over a customer’s existing roof; and a solar roof, which replaces the current roof slats with ones capable of soaking up the sun’s rays and transforming it into energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW0WwD"&gt;Now, prices for Tesla’s solar roof product are starting to go up dramatically. One solar roof customer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;he signed a contract in February to install the solar roof for $35,000, with an additional $30,000 for the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dhZVVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;he received a “terse email” stating that he would receive a new contract with higher prices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KxyLfO"&gt;Later, he received a “terse email” from Tesla stating that in several days he would receive a new contract with higher prices. He was told he now owed $75,000 for the solar roof — a 114 percent increase — and $35,000 for the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6bNeA"&gt;This person was told he could cancel his order via a customer portal if he chose not to accept the new terms, with the implicit threat that the installation project would be delayed if he didn’t accept the new terms right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b34h8q"&gt;Here is the email he received from Tesla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="D9ZapL"&gt;We have increased the price of Solar Roof and have added adjustments for individual roof complexity. &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-roof/learn/roof-complexity"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H30MkQ"&gt;You will receive an email in the next 1-2 days when your new agreement is ready for your review and acceptance before moving forward. If you are no longer interested in moving forward with Solar Roof, you can cancel your order by logging into your &lt;a href="http://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount"&gt;Tesla Account&lt;/a&gt; and your deposit will automatically be refunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHcfpJ"&gt;We will be prioritizing customers based on the order in which they accept their updated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFR7TC"&gt;However, he discovered there was no way to cancel his order through the customer portal, requiring him to track down a Tesla customer service representative to complete the cancellation. The customer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that he was disappointed by the price increase because it’s been difficult to find a decent alternative to what Tesla was offering. His emails to the company’s reps went unanswered for weeks until a friend of his who worked at Tesla was able to connect him to the right person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0ODUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s painful to move on”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZ6LkP"&gt;“It’s painful to move on, but the customer service / sales process was really painful even before this change,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmXYVQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/11/tesla-hikes-solar-roof-price-on-contracts-signed-over-a-year-ago/"&gt;Some customers told &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that they had spent thousands of dollars on loans and to clear trees in preparation for the solar roof installation only to later find out they owed tens of thousands of dollars more to Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFcrqx"&gt;It’s an abrupt shift for Tesla compared to three years ago, when the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523750/tesla-solar-panels-price-slash-decline-sales-roof"&gt;slashing prices&lt;/a&gt; for its solar roofs in an attempt to halt a decline in its home energy business. It also comes several years after Tesla unveiled a glass version of its solar panels, a third version of the company’s design that was supposed to be quicker and cheaper to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTntFL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/1LRLZK_2020_Q4_Quarterly_Update_Deck_-_Searchable_LVA2GL.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q4-2020-Update.pdf%22"&gt;In its latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla said it was picking up the pace of installations. “This growth is the result of meaningful improvements to our solar retrofit strategy, including product simplification, cost reduction and industry-leading pricing,” the company said. “We have also made great progress growing our Solar Roof deployments, as we have expanded the team while simultaneously improving our installation efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Joteu2"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, which isn’t surprising considering the company has eliminated its public relations department and hasn’t responded to a request for comment in over a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWmbLh"&gt;Musk originally unveiled the solar roof &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13463236/tesla-solar-roof-battery-new-elon-musk"&gt;in October 2016&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity"&gt;set of &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, Tesla was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13698314/tesla-completes-acquisition-solarcity-elon-musk"&gt;middle of acquiring SolarCity&lt;/a&gt; — a company founded by Musk’s cousins. That deal stirred up controversy, with critics calling it a “bailout” of the struggling SolarCity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAphVZ"&gt;A number of Tesla shareholders even sued Musk over the deal, alleging he overvalued SolarCity and claiming he did not properly recuse himself from the deal. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-solarcity-lawsuit/tesla-directors-settle-isolating-musk-as-solarcity-trial-looms-idUSKBN1ZT2HF"&gt;Tesla’s board of directors settled the suit&lt;/a&gt; last year without Musk, leaving the CEO the lone defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making a live-action Gundam movie, directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKjLzbj_5BxffAX0p45vC2zGygw=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114322/AAAABWHl6sE3EmgkjAhahgMimzoBzTJZLXHhEDPhWBTcTUc4a3qZxQdws5y_i3LQrBJlPR2952KvvGWjt_BwxLTUHDtD0qNf.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUi5Fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; is about to make the jump to live action in a big way — Legendary Pictures is working on a feature film version of Sunrise’s incredibly popular mech suit anime for Netflix, set to be directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (best known for his work on &lt;em&gt;Kong: Skull Island&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez8rnM"&gt;Legendary was first announced to be working with Sunrise on the live-action &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film in 2018, although today’s news doesn’t shed too much light on the upcoming project, which only has a working title at this point. Netflix hasn’t announced details on who might be cast or what the plot will be (or even if the movie will be adapting any of the dozens of different anime arcs, series, and films that already exist in Sunrise’s franchise). Brian K. Vaughan is attached to the project as a writer and executive producer, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aUuf9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grab your Mobile suits! Jordan Vogt-Roberts has been set to direct and produce Legendary’s first-ever live-action feature film version of Sunrise’s GUNDAM for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;— NX (@NXOnNetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1381653387444252673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot0jCp"&gt;The project does feel like a nearly perfect blend of subject, studio, and director: Legendary has already produced both &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim &lt;/em&gt;movies (solely focused on gigantic mecha fights) as well as the Godzilla / King Kong “Monsterverse” (most recently capped off by &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, which also features a giant mecha.) And Vogt-Roberts is no stranger to gigantic battles, either, having previously directed &lt;em&gt;Kong: Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; for Legendary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HohqtE"&gt;The upcoming &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film isn’t Netflix’s first live-action adaptation of a beloved Sunrise anime, either: the streaming service is already working on a live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; starring John Cho, which could arrive as early as this year. &lt;/p&gt;
