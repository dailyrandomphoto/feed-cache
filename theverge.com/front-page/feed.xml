    <title>Samsung’s tiny Freestyle projector is fun so get over it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQXMA_LFZ4u8NcypK0IT_7cnvbg=/46x0:555x339/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348778/freestyle_clip.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0zWvu"&gt;Samsung’s new barrel-shaped Freestyle projector was just announced at CES. The 1080p projector goes up for preorder today for $899. What matters more than its spec sheet, according to Samsung, is that this highly portable and swiveling visual lightshow with integrated speaker and voice control is coming to support your carefree “lifestyle” and nomadic “experiences.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGv09I"&gt;Olds, in other words, need not apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryOf6O"&gt;How can I be certain of this? Because when I, a curmudgeonly old, showed the Freestyle to my 13-year-old daughter under strict embargo, her first reaction was, and I quote: “I want that. A fake window on my wall would be so pretty.” A sampling of one teen is surely correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kVg1gn1sb0X0sqc1L29p-oX86g8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142934/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (front).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0v-es_PsSUX93HlasmAgNcO3UFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142938/Samsung_The_Freestyle_Product_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Freestyle (back).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DR5m75"&gt;The 1.83 pound (0.83kg) projector is capable of producing an auto-focused and auto-leveled image (of unknown brightness) at sizes from 30 to 100 inches. The translucent lens cap can be used to create “mood lighting” that can be synced with whatever audio is playing. It also features a 360-degree firing speaker, and a far-field mic array for voice control that looks like it can be toggled on and off via a switch. If you look closely at the images you’ll also see one HDMI and one USB-C jack, and what looks like touch controls for power, volume, and something else encircling the lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY25xu"&gt;Optional accessories include a waterproof case, USB-C battery pack, and a base that allows the projector to be screwed into a standard E26 lightbulb socket for power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpyOyL"&gt;Freestyle seems like an ideal companion to TikTok videos, and not so much your Blu-ray collection. If you care about banalities such as lumens, embedded OSes, supported streaming protocols, and other such minutia then this projector clearly isn’t meant for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XOAgK"&gt;Samsung says preorders for the projector will open in the US as of January 4th, with the Freestyle making its way to other markets “in the following months.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung made a dedicated smart home dashboard, but it’s only coming to Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_5zQKR7lVaH2S8FF_vIDG-2fqU=/21x0:2190x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348775/Samsung_Home_Hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Home Hub is a one stop shop for your SmartThings home.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sbmkzd"&gt;Samsung introduced its first standalone SmartThings smart home controller at CES 2022. The Samsung Home Hub is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rfp5s"&gt;While there are precious few details about this new device, other than it’s not coming to the US yet and will launch in Korea in the first half of 2022, from the one picture we’ve got, it looks good. Honestly, it looks like the smart home controller we wish Apple, Amazon, or Google would make. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnhiRA"&gt;The transition from smartphone control of the smart home to voice control has not been a seamless one. There are many times when it’s easier to tap on a screen to turn on the lights or lock the back door than it is to raise your voice, and a simple, easily accessible interface to do this is something the smart home still needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4ftuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If we’re going to drag members of our households into the smart home, it’s got to be easier for them to control it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CzgDIw"&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have largely failed to provide a usable dashboard for this type of control, instead requiring multiple swipes and taps to get to what you need. These displays also try to be multitaskers in the home, part calendar, part radio, part TV, part smart home device, partly failing to do well most of what they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVtKPp"&gt;Case in point, Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought would be the solution I’d been looking for to control my smart home, since I took down the aging iPad Mini I had installed in my wall. (Its screen finally gave up the ghost — turns out being permanently plugged in and sitting vertically on my wall for four years was not good for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fv9VmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iiybzk"&gt;Sadly, the software on the Show 15 doesn’t live up to the promise of the hardware and while it looks fantastic, its limited smart home controller interface means it just won’t work for my home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1K1tn"&gt;What I, and many like me, want is a dedicated smart home dashboard, something that has shortcuts to control devices, trigger scenes, and view live camera feeds. That’s not to say there isn’t room for Echo Shows and Google Nest Hubs that do part of what they’re supposed to do really well. But a dedicated smart home interface mounted on a wall or set up on a counter is what is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INsKYD"&gt;There are a few attempts at solving this problem out there — the &lt;a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/home"&gt;touchscreen Brilliant Control Panel&lt;/a&gt; that replaces your existing light switches is an innovative solution that takes advantage of a house’s existing wiring. But installing that system in every room will set you back a pretty penny and the screen is much smaller than a tablet, making it less intuitive for all users.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTNxLts8ZSJtwi8Oh8e9PjnyrMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145171/2021_0611_Samsung_4D_Flex_Family_Hub_Menus_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Family Hub refrigerator features a built-in tablet that acts as a smart home controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cqcOVG"&gt;What I like about Samsung’s Home Hub so far is its size, its orientation, and its potential portability. A vertical screen is actually more useful for smart home control than a horizontal one, as you can fit more icons on the screen that way and ideally have quick access to more controls. The stand for the Samsung Home Hub looks like it could also hold the screen horizontally if you preferred that, and it all looks easy enough to pick up and move into a different room when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9UEFQ"&gt;I’ve used the Samsung Family Hub smart fridge, and the Home Hub interface looks similar. It also largely resembles a blown-up version of Samsung’s SmartThings smartphone app. There’s a Favorites home screen with your favorite devices on it and shortcuts to screens to access services such as SmartThings Cooking, a Devices page, a Life page where you’ll find Samsung’s connected services — such as Cooking, Clothing Care, Energy, Pet, and Air, and an Automations page, plus and intriguing More tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiMBt"&gt;It’s not the smart home dashboard of my dreams, but it is a step in the right direction: a dedicated device for controlling the many aspects of your smart home that doesn’t attempt to do unnecessary party tricks but gives you and your household an easy way to turn the home on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bphjZn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have failed to provide a usable smart home interface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhIHQW"&gt;Speaking of Samsung’s connected services, the SmartThings Energy Service, which monitors the power usage of all compatible connected devices and recommends ways for you to save energy based on usage patterns, is being expanded to include more products and services. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-expands-smartthings-energy-service-for-eco-friendly-home-solutions/"&gt;Samsung also announced partnerships earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that enable real-time monitoring of whole-home energy consumption in the SmartThings App. This type of integration should allow homeowners to set up automations based on energy costs or demand response events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtNybN"&gt;During its CES keynote, Samsung also announced that it’s a founding member of the newly minted Home Connectivity Alliance (HCA). Founded in September 2021, the HCA’s main goal is creating “&lt;a href="https://homeconnectivityalliance.org/news-events/"&gt;Cloud to cloud interoperability across brands&lt;/a&gt;,” according to its website. Samsung’s press release stated the Alliance will help “ensure that having devices across multiple brands doesn’t require you to compromise your smart home experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbFUi"&gt;Samsung is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, a new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; with similar goals. How this initiative will fit in with Matter is unclear at this stage. Matter is a local protocol, with devices communicating primarily over a local network while still allowing IP access to connect to the internet. This new Alliance appears to be focused on expanding connectivity between cloud-based services. This is something Samsung has been pursing more aggressively since it started to transition its SmartThings platform from a hardware-based smart home hub to a software-based service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Samsung Odyssey Ark is its largest curved monitor yet — and you can turn it on its side</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ekJm6mJ8NVftcQIavuMAT4I0BDw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348774/Odyssey_Ark_side__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKUqvu"&gt;Samsung now makes the biggest, curviest, you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it PC monitors out there; two &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editors recently replaced their multi-monitor setups with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;single 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9&lt;/a&gt; when it went on sale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/12/23/22850641/odyssey-g9-gaming-monitor-razer-keyboard-smart-frames-epic-games-deal-sale"&gt;for $999&lt;/a&gt; the other week. But the company’s not satisfied simply filling your &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; field of view with 49 inches of real estate — today at CES, it’s revealing an even bigger 55-inch curved screen with a special stand that lets you flip the gigantic monitor vertically, so the screen curves right over your head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qqw9ZM"&gt;It’s called the Samsung Odyssey Ark, and the company is pitching it as a real product that it’s planning to bring to the United States in the second half of the year. We don’t have a price, release date, or specs, though. It’s not even clear if it’s aimed at gaming, productivity, or just being a fashion statement. Details are so light that I’m going to share the entirety of what Samsung sent us with you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ibVMNF"&gt;Odyssey Ark is a next-generation flexible monitor perfect for people doing everything from editing to gaming at home. The Ark is the new industry-leading gaming display with a curved 55-inch display and 16:9 aspect ratio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7reYJ"&gt;The HAS (Height Adjustable Stand), pivot and tilt functionality, in addition to advanced ergonomic design, offers every gamer optimal comfort. This new vertical cockpit-style rotating display provides a new gaming experience and allows portrait or landscape orientation for multi-tasking and multi-window setup.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or3Ptz"&gt;Multiview options allow users to adjust Odyssey Ark exactly how they want it with a totally adaptable screen size to fit the game or the program without compromising its 4K display and bright, colorful images. The monitor also features a wireless, dial controller to manage lighting and the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TR3Fa4"&gt;With a 16:9 aspect ratio, it wouldn’t be quite the same as those earlier super-ultrawide 32:9 monitors, even though the curve looks much the same from here. (Does that mean it’s just a very curved TV? Not quite, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv#comments"&gt;TVs and monitors are getting WAY closer these days&lt;/a&gt;.) The traditional aspect ratio could help with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;the stretching effect I saw in games&lt;/a&gt; and less wasted space around movies and shows. But having reviewed a pair of these super curved monitors now, I’m struggling to think of a reason why I’d want to turn one vertically. Let me know if a reason occurs to you? (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850959/lg-display-media-chair-virtual-ride-concepts-ces-2022"&gt;LG Display’s curved OLED throne&lt;/a&gt; could also use some vertical screen ideas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyfHpy"&gt;Here’s a picture of the Odyssey Ark’s dial controller and the huge horizontal curve, by the way:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCGQKXnTXsJtn2ul1IeZMn0S2V4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146140/Odyssey_Ark_above.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vjfJQ2"&gt;Samsung also introduced a smaller 4K version of its Odyssey Neo G9 this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs"&gt;a 32-inch version called the Odyssey Neo G8&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll let you know when the Ark has more details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony pivots into cars with Sony Mobility and a Vision-S SUV prototype at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony Mobility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afULrmfuNFNqAlPdCAzjxEHZqV0=/117x0:807x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348653/sony_mobility.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dS1bnG"&gt;During Sony’s keynote presentation at CES 2022, the company rolled out the &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/vision-s/"&gt;Vision-S EV&lt;/a&gt; we saw last year, along with a new concept SUV dubbed Vision-S 02. But the big surprise (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"&gt;this time&lt;/a&gt;) is &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202201/22-002E/"&gt;the launch of Sony Mobility&lt;/a&gt;, a new company it’s starting that will focus on electric cars. While the tech industry has been focused for several years on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/19/8072851/apple-car-news-rumors"&gt;whether or not Apple might produce a vehicle&lt;/a&gt;, Sony already showed us a working prototype packed full of its technology, and now it’s going a step further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xtzsK7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony will establish an operating company “Sony Mobility Inc.” in the spring of 2022, through which the company intends to explore entry into the EV market.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="VAaH68"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jZmLIe_vEA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eF5G4L"&gt;Sony posted several demo videos on YouTube featuring both Vision-S prototype EVs. Some, like the two-minute Concept Movie above, give hints of the picture-perfect lifestyle these cars could be a part of. Others show off the design of the user interface or feature a test of remote driving via a 5G connection linking Tokyo and Germany in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPdGdOgJO8w48pzfC9ewnCyMoNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146234/vision_s_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
&lt;aside id="MDl3MV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony surprises with an electric concept car called the Vision-S ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOynDkZ4hfoNjufq5mjDxQb1pf8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146166/sony.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kODjC9"&gt;We don’t know if this all leads to actually taking a Sony-brand car for a spin someday, but clearly, it has a vision for the autonomous, electric future that it’s pursuing.  “We are exploring a commercial launch of Sony’s EV,” said Kenichiro Yoshida, the company’s chairman, president, and CEO. That exploration will apparently find out how a “creative entertainment company” can “redefine mobility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YO0qdx"&gt;During last year’s reveal of the Vision-S, Sony talked a lot about its capabilities with sensors, and we’ll see how it uses that technological advantage in the car industry. In 2021, it already shared some pain with automakers in dealing with the chip shortage, whether it intends to join the party as a full-fledged competitor or some form of supplier or partner is what we, and possibly Sony, don’t know yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zK7Uxi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K9bC81mPR6s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>You can now watch the Uncharted movie’s entire plane fight scene </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJEKTwg3RcErGVO6p9oWpcuuxOo=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348751/maxresdefault__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IjUl9N"&gt;You &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851876/uncharted-new-movie-trailer-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-playstation"&gt;what kind of video game movie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; will be. You know it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;in your heart&lt;/a&gt;. But just in case you don’t know that you know it, you can now watch PlayStation Pictures’ entire live-action recreation of &lt;em&gt;the infamous scene&lt;/em&gt; from that one &lt;em&gt;Uncharted &lt;/em&gt;video game where Nathan Drake gets dragged out of an airplane by a rope ladder consisting of gigantic pieces of cargo and somehow manages to survive, without any cuts or annoying plot to get in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcFwLb"&gt;There is a lot of green screen. Lots of baddies go down. Very young actors appear to do acrobatic things. &lt;em&gt;Action abounds&lt;/em&gt;, just as Sony promised it would in the company’s CES 2022 presentation this evening, where it also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867818/sony-mobility-cars-vision-prototype-ces-2022"&gt;it’s pivoting into electric cars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISRpge"&gt;I am now adequately prepared to watch this movie. Are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="54AMFr"&gt;If not, here are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738187/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-mark-wahlberg"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851876/uncharted-new-movie-trailer-tom-holland-mark-wahlberg-playstation"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; trailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shure’s new Aonic 40 are a slightly cheaper pair of noise-canceling wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUlgSWwvmaxeMqBZocHhozkyTqU=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348677/SBH1DYBK1_AONIC40_Black_StillLife_YogaMat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Aonic 40 is made of aluminum alloy and glass-filled nylon.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Shure&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="auklSM"&gt;Shure has expanded its headphone lineup with the release of the new Aonic 40. The Aonic 40 are a set of wireless over-ear headphones with adjustable active noise cancellation, Environment Mode, 40mm composite drivers, USB-C quick charging, and an estimated 25 hours of battery life with ANC turned on. Priced at $249, this new model sits below the current $299 &lt;a href="https://www.shure.com/en-US/products/headphones/aonic50"&gt;Aonic 50&lt;/a&gt; in Shure’s lineup — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;earned a nod in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s best noise-canceling headphones of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — and shares some features like a user-customizable EQ through the ShurePlus Play app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7hOhjp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msWzAv"&gt;While the Aonic 40 have a slightly revised look taken from their older sibling, with an aluminum build and a collapsible design, 2020’s Aonic 50 remain at the top of Shure’s wireless headphone line with larger 50mm drivers and 32-bit audio with LDAC support. The cheaper Aonic 40 have three levels of noise cancellation, with an Environment Mode to let in ambient sound — all accessible via physical controls. Shure’s claim of up to 25 hours of battery life is more than the Aonic 50’s estimated 20, putting them closer to popular competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; headphones and their estimated 30 hours of battery. The new headphones can also be used for phone calls and videoconferencing, utilizing dual beamforming microphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75Heg5"&gt;The Aonic 40 are available now in black and white / tan colorways and come with a carrying case, 3.5mm cable, USB-C cable, and a two-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wIe4Xf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10942089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sony confirms PlayStation VR2 name and Horizon game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQw32w6yeHJdKURZC61oV6VsdCM=/0x1:1200x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348643/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKW0XC"&gt;Sony has confirmed the name of its next VR headset: unsurprisingly, it’s going to be called PlayStation VR2. Sony Interactive Entertainment president and CEO Jim Ryan announced the name as part of Sony’s CES 2022 presentation, in a move reminiscent of two years ago when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21019829/sony-playstation-5-ps5-logo-reveal-ps4-users-numbers-ces-2020"&gt;PS5 logo was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; on stage in Vegas amid much fanfare. (It looked like the PS3 and PS4 logos but with a 5.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iooj85"&gt;Sony still hasn’t shown off what the headset itself will look like, but we know quite a bit about its technical specs already. PS VR2 will work with the PS5, of course, and Sony also detailed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337700/sony-new-ps5-playstation-5-vr-controllers-features"&gt;controllers&lt;/a&gt; — now officially named Sense controllers — all the way back in March. The headset supports haptic feedback, eye tracking, 4K HDR, 90/120Hz frame rates, foveated rendering, and a field of view of 110 degrees, and it connects to the PS5 with a single USB-C cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vsoy1"&gt;Ryan also announced the first big new exclusive title for PSVR2: &lt;em&gt;Horizon Call of the Mountain&lt;/em&gt;. It’ll follow next month’s &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, one of Sony’s tentpole releases for 2022, though there’s no indication of a release date for either the game or the headset just yet. You can watch a brief teaser trailer below. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ROG Strix Flare II Animate puts a tiny dot-matrix display on a keyboard  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SvgZDJON9iKBYaZfS0HOSSuAFMw=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348641/kt3J8vZY.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A built-in display can show animation, system info, and more.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7I1T2"&gt;ROG, one of Asus’s gaming brands, &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/keyboards/keyboards/aura-rgb/rog-strix-flare-ii-animate-model/"&gt;has announced the Strix Flare II Animate&lt;/a&gt;, a mechanical keyboard that gets its name from the LED display built into it, which can play animations or display logos, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21052249/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-amd-ryzen-4000-dot-matrix-display-lid-ces-2020"&gt;dot-matrix displays ROG’s built into the lids of some laptops&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhmXNQ"&gt;Asus calls this tech the AniMe Matrix LED display, and says you can use it to show all sorts of things; custom images and animations, system info like battery life, time, and date, and even audio visualizations. It’s blingy, to say the least, and more eye-catching than an illuminated logo. That could be a good thing though — this keyboard will cost $220, so it has to justify that price somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04VKbRJBovd_EgrPMhOP3Qo96BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146118/animatrix_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes, ROG’s all-caps font does make it look like it’s called Anime Matrix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m0MMrm"&gt;As if the Strix Flare II Animate didn’t have enough lighting with the 312 mini-LEDs display, Asus also added an RGB strip on the bottom. “But wait,” I can hear my hands protesting. “Won’t adding a wrist rest cover up all that lighting?” And indeed, yes it would — if the wrist rest included with this keyboard didn’t include a diffuser that gives it a colorful underglow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/agLhMKlBsugjU01Blj2Ks5-z1Dg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146043/msnnkdJE.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who doesn’t love some nice, diffused RGBs?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WoIb6Uv4HDmhwfSWXbnZm7VWO3g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146052/3D_7_US_ABS_02_FA.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wrist rest even has a place to hold the diffuser that’s usually on the keyboard, which you have to take off when installing the rest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PylFBS"&gt;The Flare II Animate also has a laundry list of non-screen and RGB-related features, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnV8Vk"&gt;8000Hz polling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dKojl3"&gt;Media controls, which take the shape of a knob, scroll wheel, and button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MEc0AX"&gt;USB 2.0 passthrough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="frPJLt"&gt;PBT Double-shot keycaps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BodmSM"&gt;Sound-dampening foam&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="FHqiv2"&gt;Finally, and somewhat importantly when it comes to a keyboard, are the actual key switches. The Animate comes with either Cherry MX Blue, Brown, or Red switches. You can also get it with Asus’s own ROG NX switches, also in three different flavors. It even has swappable switches, so you can switch out switches depending on your preference — for example, you could make it harder to press the space bar, and easier to press the WASD.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZ8LFqldC-s-Q3JvzgXf_JGWdVU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23146121/p.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the key caps and key switches can be swapped on the Animate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWFK4S"&gt;If you’re not into the heavy bling (and price) of the Animate, Asus will also sell a standard Strix Flare II for $180. There are more caveats though. It doesn’t have as many switch choices, as they’re not easily swappable, and it can’t be equipped with Cherry switches.  You also, obviously, miss out on the AniMe screen — it’s replaced by an RGB ROG logo (the lights on the bottom are gone too). Other than that it’s similar; it still has most of the Animate’s features, like N-key rollover, a 2-meter braided cable, and macro support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRML1v"&gt;The Strix Flare II non-animated will be available late this month, and Asus says the Animate’s “tentative” availability is around late January as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision sues company distributing Call of Duty cheats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oBratJbd_KOWHcY6qLZVnRDeQZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348603/acastro_300505_4008_pcGameHacks_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DpLjPu"&gt;Activision Publishing, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, filed &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21173574-activision-publishing-v-engineowning-ug"&gt;a lawsuit Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; against EngineOwning, a company that advertises cheats for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games and other popular online shooters, and is seeking to shut down software that allows people to cheat in any Activision-published game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXAa1K"&gt;“By this lawsuit, Activision seeks to put a stop to unlawful conduct by an organization that is distributing and selling for profit numerous malicious software products designed to enable members of the public to gain unfair competitive advantages (i.e., to cheat) in the COD Games,” Activision said. “These ongoing activities damage Activision’s games, its overall business, and the experience of the COD player community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBLP3h"&gt;According to the lawsuit, “the Cheating Software enables players to manipulate the COD Games to their personal advantage, such as by automatically aiming weapons, revealing the locations of opponents, and allowing the player to see information that is not normally available to players because it would give them an unfair advantage within the game.” The company says it believes the defendants “have been fully aware that their conduct violates Activision’s rights but nevertheless have brazenly continued their activities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMZQ6"&gt;The company is naming 50 “Does” in the lawsuit, and while it notes the believed identities of some individuals involved with EngineOwning, it acknowledges that “the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, of the Doe defendants are unknown to Activision.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjIbH8"&gt;Activision has recently been making a lot of effort to tamp down cheaters in the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games, focusing a particular amount of attention on the hugely popular — and free to play — &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;. The company rolled out its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724037/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-system-kernel-level-driver"&gt;Ricochet anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt; globally in &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/12/RICOCHET-Anti-Cheat-Progress-Report-Global-Deployment"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, and the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1473746439553617923"&gt;soon after&lt;/a&gt; that it had banned 48,000 “cheater accounts” thanks to the new system. In the lawsuit, Activision says it has “been able to identify and ban hundreds of thousands of accounts using cheating software in the COD Games in just over the past year.” (That presumably refers to 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qxCmc5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  48K cheater accounts were banned yesterday across &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Warzone?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Warzone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Vanguard?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TeamRICOCHET?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TeamRICOCHET&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CEnAUFwcvt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CEnAUFwcvt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1473746439553617923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6gG2nk"&gt;A Twitter account that appears to belong to EngineOwning did not immediately reply to a Twitter DM asking for comment. It has not posted about the lawsuit on that account, and its website is live as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ucN6"&gt;Activision Blizzard is currently embroiled in scandal after being sued by the state of California, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;which alleges&lt;/a&gt; it fostered a culture of “constant sexual harassment” and gender-based discrimination. Some workers at the company have entered their &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1478186596688179202"&gt;third week of a strike&lt;/a&gt; to protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA employees at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;, which is known for its work on &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 10 Pro’s official specs are not the least bit surprising</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O5xlWi"&gt;Rather than announce all of the details of the OnePlus 10 Pro flagship, OnePlus is choosing to space out the details in drips and drabs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22613909"&gt;First, it released an official teaser image&lt;/a&gt; that revealed the design of the phone alongside a China release date of January 11th. Now, it’s announcing the phone’s specs, which include the newest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor, ultra fast charging, and a 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpZFls"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up on Android news the past few months, none of these details will come as a surprise. Flagship Android phones in the US all tend to feature Qualcomm’s most powerful processor and if there’s any interesting news here, it’s that OnePlus is getting a small jump on Samsung and becoming the first major smartphone to use the new chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY2nCD"&gt;The rest of the specs are exactly what you’d probably expect. Though, unfortunately, OnePlus is still leaving out a few key details like the amount of RAM on each model, prices, precise screen sizes, and release dates outside of China. In any case, here are a few of the specs it’s revealing today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="w5kB6W"&gt;Processor: Snapdragon 8 Gen 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IMUVv3"&gt;Rear camera: 48MP + 50 MP + 8MP, Dual OIS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nUJbSy"&gt;Front camera: 32MP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O8Gz5l"&gt;Display: 120Hz “Fluid AMOLED with LTPP”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcdE8s"&gt;Battery: 5,000mAh&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MWFiwr"&gt;Wired charging: 80W SuperVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9uHOIw"&gt;Wireless charging: 50W AirVOOC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NxpCD9"&gt;OS: OxygenOS 12&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ogvvID"&gt;Dimensions: 163 x 73.9 x 8.55mm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dVNg1T"&gt;There are a few things to note in that list. Along with picking up Oppo’s operating system, the OnePlus 10 is also using Oppo’s branding for its fast-charging system. Until now OnePlus had the same system but used its own Warp Charge brand. Branding aside, the rated speeds are still ridiculously fast. The dimensions also tell us that the OnePlus 10 Pro is a very large phone, nearly the size of a Galaxy S21 Ultra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMJ3MD"&gt;As with any Android phone these days, there have been plenty of rumors to fill in the gaps. We’re expecting RAM options to either be 8GB or 12GB, with 128GB or 256GB of storage. As for the rest of the details, including a rumored April release, we’ll need to wait for OnePlus to provide more details in its next announcement — or the one after that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHZOgA"&gt;Why do companies like OnePlus and Google space out the details on their new phones instead of giving us a single announcement? Your guess is as good as ours, but the obvious one is probably the right one: it gives them multiple bites at the Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
