    <title>Humble Bundle will start capping charitable donations in mid-July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1zkW0ITGSxzFl6tlAPQlUNoWLpE=/0x238:2688x2030/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69532331/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_3.32.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tzCZCK"&gt;Humble Bundle has announced that it’s going to change how payment sliders will work in its storefront by removing the ability to donate all of what you spend to charity and setting an average minimum cut for Humble Bundle itself between 15 to 30 percent (&lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/despite-backlash-humble-bundles-donation-limit-returns-1847212248"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The change goes into effect in “mid-July.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHkheq"&gt;When you buy a bundle of games, ebooks, or software on Humble Bundle, you’re traditionally given the option to choose how much of your money goes to Humble Bundle, the creator of what you’re buying, and a charity via a slider for each. Those sliders are sticking around, but now they’ll have a bit less range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05hhkK"&gt;The company justified the change &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/07/01/changes-coming-to-humble-bundle-sliders/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing its plans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="736VXQ"&gt;Why change after ten years? The PC storefront landscape has changed significantly since we first launched bundles in 2010, and we have to continue to evolve with it to stay on mission. The update will allow us to continue to offer great prices on amazing games, books and software all while supporting important charitable initiatives with every single purchase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K2Yb4RA5rulN2_IHTK61x8_-xHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694718/blog_charity.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Humble Bundle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Humble Bundle’s proposed “toggle” redesign. The new set-up still exists, with the option for making custom donations with sliders buried in a menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8sUuZx"&gt;Humble Bundle first committed to &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/04/23/a-note-about-sliders-and-our-bundle-pages/"&gt;changing how payments would work in April&lt;/a&gt;, announcing it would eliminate sliders completely, cap donations to charity at 15 percent, and introduce a series of toggles “with defined splits that clearly show what amount of your purchase will support Humble, publishers, and charity.” Users were &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/humble-bundle-moves-to-limit-charitable-donations-to-15-1846751524"&gt;critical of the idea of shrinking donations&lt;/a&gt; while Humble Bundle would have been guaranteed to get a piece of every purchase, and the company ultimately &lt;a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2021/05/05/an-update-on-bundle-sliders/"&gt;rolled back its planned changes&lt;/a&gt; and announced it would explore other ways to improve upon payments. Thursday’s news is the company’s alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAJIQk"&gt;Humble Bundle became well-known for its flexible pay-what-you-want bundles. The original form of sliders allowed a customer to kick more of their money towards the developer or a charity, including reducing Humble Bundle’s cut to zero in favor of the other two. Humble said going forward after its planned change, splits will vary on bundles, but it expects to take a cut somewhere between 15 to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AHioie"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sliders don’t matter, but flexibility does&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxZbTq"&gt;It makes sense that the cost of getting games to participate in bundles would have gone up, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;some storefront’s like the Epic Games Store&lt;/a&gt; writing checks to give away exclusive games for free, but it is disappointing that Humble Bundle has backed away somewhat from the more altruistic model it made its name on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkrXJ2"&gt;As someone who’s used Humble Bundle to buy games in the past, I wasn’t as attached to sliders as I was the flexibility they represented — the idea that if I wanted to, I could know all of my money was going to the people who might need it most. Other stores like Itch.io allow you to send more money to developers directly, but Humble Bundle’s setup was unique. Come mid-July, it’ll just be a little less flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Branson aims to fly to space before Jeff Bezos, Virgin Galactic confirms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ECONOMY-NYSE-VIRGIN" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qMKHAdCBShjPmUvbU1_yg8Cics=/18x0:5381x3575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69532035/1178650261.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aYs7oy"&gt;Space tourism firm Virgin Galactic will fly its founder Richard Branson on its next test flight slated for July 11th, the company confirmed Thursday. Branson’s new flight date will come before rival Jeff Bezos is expected to fly in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;his own space tourism rocket on July 20th&lt;/a&gt;, setting the stage for a largely symbolic showdown between two billionaires racing to validate their space tourism rockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8U2Rgu"&gt;Branson, 70, wasn’t set to fly on&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Virgin Galactic’s VSS Unity spaceplane for another two tests — until Thursday, when the company announced he’d fly on July 11th “testing the private astronaut experience” alongside four mission specialists and two pilots. “I’ve always been a dreamer,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1410729503337418756"&gt;Branson tweeted after the announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next Virgin Galactic spaceflight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nEBf1s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’ve always been a dreamer. My mum taught me to never give up and to reach for the stars. On July 11, it’s time to turn that dream into a reality aboard the next &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VirginGalactic&lt;/a&gt; spaceflight &lt;a href="https://t.co/x0ksfnuEQ3"&gt;https://t.co/x0ksfnuEQ3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Unity22?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Unity22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/GWskcMSXyA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/GWskcMSXyA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1410729503337418756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ekw90u"&gt;The mission, dubbed Unity 22, will mark Virgin Galactic’s fourth crewed test flight of VSS Unity, a spaceplane that launches from a carrier aircraft mid-air and ascends toward the edge of space to give passengers a few minutes of weightlessness. It will be “the first to carry a full crew of two pilots and four mission specialists in the cabin, including the Company’s founder, Sir Richard Branson, who will be testing the private astronaut experience,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdH47i"&gt;Unity, designed to carry up to six passengers and two pilots, has been tested 22 times, with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448928/virgin-galactic-spaceplane-vss-unity-space-branson"&gt;most recent test&lt;/a&gt; taking place at Virgin Galactic’s lavish Spaceport America base in New Mexico. Three more test flights including Branson’s remain this year before Virgin Galactic carries out its first revenue-generating mission for the Italian Air Force. The company has some 600 reservations for paying customers on future space flights, with each ticket going for around $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="soIpoW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Something “very exciting” will be announced after the flight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wst5j9"&gt;Branson, in a video he tweeted, teased an additional announcement after his July 11th flight. “When we return, I will announce something very exciting to give more people a chance to become astronauts, because space does belong to us all,” he said. “So watch this space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piYllT"&gt;Blue Origin announced last month that Bezos, its founder, will be on board its first crewed mission of New Shepard, a suborbital rocket designed to send passengers to the same heights as VSS Unity for a few minutes of weightlessness. That rocket launches vertically from the company’s remote spaceport in Van Horn, Texas. New Shepard has flown 15 times without crews on board, with the most recent uncrewed flight serving as an astronaut training rehearsal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBdKuK"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s announcement comes on the same day Blue Origin announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;the fourth crew member&lt;/a&gt; for its first crewed New Shepard flight — Wally Funk, a legendary aviator who also holds a ticket for Virgin’s VSS Unity. Bezos, his brother Mark, and the winning bidder of a $28 million auction for a New Shepard seat will also be on board for that July 20th mission. Unlike Virgin Galactic, Blue Origin hasn’t announced the ticket price for future New Shepard flights just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LdXvUp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;July 11th — “pending tech checks and weather, of course.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Leb7hV"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration granted Virgin Galactic approval to fly space customers last week as a tweak to the company’s commercial space transportation operator license, marking the first time the FAA licensed a spaceline to fly customers. Blue Origin doesn’t have the same FAA approval to fly customers ahead of its July 20th flight with Bezos yet, but is getting close to securing it, according to a person familiar with the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJOfeX"&gt;Space blogger Parabolic Arc was the &lt;a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/06/07/virgin-galactics-richard-branson-aims-to-fly-to-space-before-jeff-bezos/"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on an accelerated timeline for Branson’s flight. Spokespeople for Virgin Galactic had neither confirmed nor denied the report until Thursday. A company spokeswoman said Branson’s July 11th flight hinges on “tech checks and weather, of course.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Blue Screen of Death is changing to black in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/psATsoCzSgIoZvY08Yy16XEHg48=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531788/windows11bsod.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 11’s new Black Screen of Death.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lvvm49"&gt;Microsoft is changing its famous Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) to black in Windows 11. The software giant started testing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;new design changes in a Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, but the Black Screen of Death isn’t fully enabled yet. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; understands Microsoft will be switching to a Black Screen of Death for Windows 11, matching the new black logon and shutdown screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7z9if"&gt;It’s the first major change to the BSOD since Microsoft added a sad face to the screen in Windows 8 in 2012, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/12/11412906/microsoft-windows-10-blue-screen-of-death-qr-code"&gt;QR codes in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft first introduced the BSOD in Windows 3.0, offering a way for IT professionals and support personnel to diagnose hardware and memory faults. A BSOD is Windows’ own kernel error or bug check, and it usually includes a dump of data that can help system administrators analyze what system fault caused the blue screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3KVhnFRMv3GivX5jsTATqJguW4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694673/windows11bsod.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Black Screen of Death in Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wgdQW0"&gt;While Microsoft is switching to a Black Screen of Death in Windows 11, the screen is identical to the one found in Windows 10 otherwise. The sad face remains, as does the stop code and crash dump. The current preview of Windows 11 includes a green BSOD, a color that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/29/14111584/microsoft-windows-10-green-screen-of-death"&gt;Microsoft has been using for Windows Insider builds since 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O78K4r"&gt;We’re not entirely sure why Microsoft is changing the color from blue to black, and the company isn’t commenting on the change yet. I have some theories, though. Microsoft is overhauling many parts of Windows 11, with a fresh approach to the OS. It’s likely because Windows 11 includes a visual overhaul to modernize the OS in key areas, including classic parts like the Start menu, File Explorer, and now even the BSOD.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is reportedly trying a ‘retail flex’ work-from-home program for store employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTS4UOxf8ngm7iYOViexxXAdujA=/0x154:3036x2178/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531620/IMG_20171003_180359.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91L5C2"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a program called “Retail Flex,” which will give its store employees the chance to work from home some weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/apple-to-test-hybrid-work-from-store-and-home-for-retail-staff"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; Mark Gurman. According to the report, the employees would be remotely handling things like tech support and online sales part of the time, and working at the store as usual at other times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuXefm"&gt;Having employees who traditionally work in a store transitioning to a remote role, even if it’s only a partial change, is a big shift, likely brought on by the pandemic. It doesn’t seem like Apple is just jumping into it. The company is reportedly starting a pilot program that will last at least six months, with participating employees being paid the same salary, plus some extra for internet and office equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OleH27"&gt;If Apple does end up adopting a model that sees fewer employees working retail, it likely won’t be alone. With the US starting to enter its post-pandemic stage, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/how-coronavirus-pandemic-forever-altered-retail.html"&gt;physical stores will have to contend&lt;/a&gt; with the new habits people have formed of shopping online and doing in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQbKMM"&gt;For its non-retail staff, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;will require at least some office time&lt;/a&gt;, with employees having to return to the office at least three days a week. Some of Apple’s workers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back against having to return to the office&lt;/a&gt;, but the company will reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;still go through&lt;/a&gt; with the hybrid work model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dKmIm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to imagine many retail employees working from home during the iPhone launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTSWdZ"&gt;There’s an interesting contrast with Apple potentially lowering the number of retail employees it has working at most given times, and the other retail moves it’s been making. Over the past few years, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16296460/apple-self-love-iphonex-iphone8-event"&gt;rebranding some of its stores as “town halls”&lt;/a&gt; where events and classes can take place, and it just recently restored two historic buildings &lt;a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/a-palazzo-reborn-inside-apples-stunning-new-store-in-via-del-corso-rome/"&gt;in Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-tower-theatre-opens-thursday-in-downtown-los-angeles/"&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; into decadent stores. Now, with news of this plan, it seems like there could be fewer employees around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipapZ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;does say that Apple’s plan is to scale employee presence with retail demand — it’s hard to imagine many employees scheduling work-from-home weeks during the iPhone launch — but we may be soon see the first steps toward a different, more online-focused Apple Store experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the tvOS 15 beta on Apple TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIyMLvWhtpqhoZXAlkrSFk2uxUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531553/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi79e4"&gt;The next big software update for Apple TV will arrive with tvOS 15. While it won’t become widely available until later this year, users who are part of Apple’s public beta program can now take it for a spin ahead of time. It’s possible and even likely that Apple will continue tinkering with tvOS 15 features ahead of its official launch, but particularly for those looking to test-drive Apple’s forthcoming SharePlay feature, the public beta has officially landed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx63fz"&gt;The goodies arriving in tvOS 15 that Apple has disclosed so far are small — you’re not going to notice a massive redesign of the tvOS interface, for example — but they’re not insignificant, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgo0ei"&gt;Though, a warning: once you install tvOS 15 on a newer Apple TV 4K box, there’s no turning back. Uninstalling the beta from your Apple TV device may not be possible with newer models. Resetting an Apple TV HD requires &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/reset-apple-tv-atvbf9db0a52/tvos"&gt;connecting a USB-C cable&lt;/a&gt; to your computer (I’ll describe the process more thoroughly later), which isn’t possible on the Apple TV 4K boxes. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Apple to ask about whether it’s possible to revert back to tvOS 14 on newer Apple TVs and will update this guide if we hear back, but a simple factory reset doesn’t cut it. (This is the case with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558944/watchos-beta-install-how-to"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt; as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SgbbwS"&gt;WHAT ARE THE NEW FEATURES ON tvOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebM5qU"&gt;For one, tvOS 15 will bring support for SharePlay to Apple TV, allowing users to stream movies and TV shows with others over FaceTime on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It’s Apple’s spin on group watch features that have largely been supported by individual services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4gSHm"&gt;There was just a handful of streaming services that Apple confirmed during WWDC would support the tool — Disney Plus, Twitch, Hulu, and Prime Video included — but we’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;likely see wider support&lt;/a&gt; before tvOS officially rolls out later this year, as Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last month that the feature will be available to any streaming service that wants to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYXbu7"&gt;Two new rows will appear in the Apple TV app in tvOS 15 as well: For All of You and Shared with You. When enabled, Shared with You will populate content that’s been shared with a user through Messages — for example, if a friend recommends &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lisey’s Story&lt;/em&gt; from Apple TV Plus. (Though you’ll need to enable it using another Apple device, and I couldn’t seem to set it up this way.) For All of You, meanwhile, will surface content that Apple believes would be a good fit for everyone in the household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuXTVz"&gt;Some additional features coming to Apple TV in tvOS 15 include support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; with AirPods Pro or AirPods Max as well as on-screen connectivity notifications for AirPods. Additionally, HomeKit will allow users to view multiple camera feeds at once. And lastly, the update will support pairing two HomePod mini speakers to an Apple TV 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKaZG3"&gt;WHAT DEVICES ARE SUPPORTED FOR iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W1o1cA"&gt;Apple TV 4K (2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bkDwMg"&gt;Apple TV 4K (2017)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kaLnAz"&gt;Apple TV HD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hMkR9v"&gt;HOW TO DOWNLOAD THE tvOS 15 BETA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="L3z3td"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="From the settings menu, toggle on “Get Public Beta Updates”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mipuoDUWSjpu5UNVRk0Pvu6GaaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694425/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_4.24.52_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the settings menu, toggle on “Get Public Beta Updates.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vx0KXZ"&gt;On your computer, sign up for &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta program&lt;/a&gt;, or sign in if you’re an existing member&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rFbzTY"&gt;Once you’re signed in, navigate to the tvOS tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UM82hE"&gt;Scroll down to the “Get Started” section of the tvOS beta page and &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/enroll#tvos"&gt;enroll your Apple TV&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pCtpwq"&gt;Now head for the settings menu on your Apple TV and select “Users and Accounts.” Make sure you’re signed in with the same Apple ID you used to register for the beta program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uDuuym"&gt;From the settings menu, select “System” &amp;gt; “Software Update,” and toggle on “Get Public Beta Updates”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AjrqKU"&gt;Once this setting is enabled, update your Apple TV from your system settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6KSLzZ"&gt;How to restore your Apple TV HD to its factory settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq3lqu"&gt;If the beta isn’t working for you, you can &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/tv/reset-apple-tv-atvbf9db0a52/tvos"&gt;restore an Apple TV HD&lt;/a&gt; (but again, &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the Apple TV 4K) to its factory settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="jPNroI"&gt;Disconnect both the HDMI and power cables from the box, then connect it to your computer using a USB-C cable. Apple suggests connecting it to a Mac running macOS Catalina or later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0XLP6g"&gt;Open Finder from your computer, and choose “Restore” from the Apple TV menu &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Dn6Uc8"&gt;If you’re attempting to reset your box with a PC, you’ll need to use iTunes to restore the Apple box from the Source list. The same goes for Macs running Mojave or older.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Amazon is ending Evangelion by bringing the final film to Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVY0eCjscsxzq5Q_3iDILBUCRhE=/0x820:1562x1861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531324/EVANGELION_3.0_1.01_THRICE_UPON_A_TIME.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjIibO"&gt;Amazon is bringing the conclusion to the Rebuild of Evangelion film series — adaptations of the beloved anime &lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion &lt;/em&gt;created by Hideaki Anno&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZfuWMDEJpw"&gt;Prime Video on August 13th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.0 + 1.01 Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt; came out in Japan in March but will be making its global premiere on Prime Video in over 240 countries and territories, Amazon says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf9epA"&gt;Alongside the final fourth film, Amazon will also stream the other films in the series, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo&lt;/em&gt;. The company hasn’t said when those films will be available on its service, but hopefully in time to catch up for &lt;em&gt;Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt;’s August release. You can watch a trailer for the new movie below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y2hNaO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZfuWMDEJpw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YINBPX"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; “Rebuilds” are an interesting mix of reworked moments from the original anime and entirely new plot lines and character backstories that only appear in the film series. If you caught up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18114331/netflix-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neon Genesis Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; when it came to Netflix in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, there are lots of interesting departures and fully animated Eva battles to discover in the Rebuilds. Plus the show and films’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/22/18701441/neon-genesis-evangelion-hedgehogs-dilemma-shinji"&gt;darker psychological themes&lt;/a&gt; probably hit too close to home for anyone who’s had a mini-existential crisis during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HXPAJ"&gt;That Amazon managed to snag &lt;em&gt;Thrice Upon a Time&lt;/em&gt; and its predecessors seems like a pretty big knock against Netflix’s anime empire. Most streaming services are now trying to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21003549/anime-streaming-wars-netflix-amazon-att-sony-crunchyroll-funimation"&gt;some kind of anime strategy&lt;/a&gt;, either through the acquisition of other platforms or just by throwing money at popular creators. Netflix missing out on scooping up more &lt;em&gt;Evangelion&lt;/em&gt; to go with the series and original two feature films it already offers is a loss. More mechs for Bezos, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfPSMq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32hI4X"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nHVwN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter considers letting you limit tweets to ‘trusted friends’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmkzaQ77Q4XmuhSE85oVm5zqCKo=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531124/trustedfriends_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup of what the new trusted friends feature could look like.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZaIbf"&gt;Twitter has shared three early design concepts for new features it’s considering for its service. “Trusted Friends” would let users limit the audience for select tweets to a smaller circle of close friends, while “Facets” could let you categorize your tweets when you send them. Finally, the service is also considering letting users list certain phrases that they’d rather not see in their replies. These ideas are in their early stages, Twitter says, and none are currently in active development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5jjlj"&gt;Many Twitter users already have multiple accounts to separate their work and personal lives, often with one of them being private to prevent sharing personal news too publicly. But features like Trusted Friends and Facets could allow for the same functionality from a single account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYnz22"&gt;Trusted Friends could offer a toggle to let you signify that a tweet should be public or only for friends (similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/30/18117718/instagram-close-friends-stories-favorites"&gt;Instagram’s “close friends” feature&lt;/a&gt;), while Facets offers more granular control, theoretically letting you sort your tweets into not just professional and personal categories, but also specific hobbies or interests you might have. Twitter says you might then be able to follow someone just for their tweets on a certain topic, rather than having to follow their account as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hLg3OPYNXY7CNjOrVBQ2RCfTUOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693129/facets_2_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facets could let you follow only select tweets from an account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qphXd7RKPCaLltlw-u1MkMuf7eA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693128/facets_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users could then select the intended recipients of each tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PeEpyi"&gt;The final proposed feature would let you specify certain phrases you’d rather not see in the replies to your tweets. Followers would then see these phrases highlighted, alongside a warning to not use this language. In one of Twitter’s example screenshots, the word “asshole” is highlighted alongside a warning. Although Twitter says that people could ignore the guidance, tweet authors would have the option of moving these violating replies to the bottom of the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00j8rZ"&gt;Twitter cautions that it isn’t currently actively building any of these features. Instead, the hope is that tweeting about them early could help the company gather feedback about its plans while they’re still in their early phases. Last month Twitter privacy designer Dominic Camozzi &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_dcrc_/status/1404578211309056006"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; a similar work in progress feature to let users “unmention” themselves when they’re tagged into a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cIc2LWhwkjGOGwVpxEqlwpnVN40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693130/smellcheck_03.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example warning about a banned phrase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EgRejo"&gt;It comes just weeks after the company started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;publicly testing a new Tip Jar feature&lt;/a&gt;, only for people to quickly discover that it risked showing whoever’s receiving the money the sender’s home address when using PayPal. Although the problem was technically caused by PayPal rather than Twitter, critics argued the social network should have given users more warning when they used the payment feature. Discussing features like these earlier in their design process could theoretically root out problems like these before release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y0bMv"&gt;Equally, Twitter’s features have a habit of becoming public before they’re officially announced because of the work of app researchers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399984/twitter-tip-button-jar-great-tweets-profiles"&gt;like Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, who dig through its app’s code for signs of unreleased functionality. If Twitter pre-announces a feature like this before it starts building it, there’s less of a chance of outsiders finding it early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RF4xbm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Perhaps the right prompt (in the right moment) can help everybody be their best selves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What do you think? And what would you call this feature?  &lt;/p&gt;— A Designer (@a_dsgnr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/a_dsgnr/status/1410690521522130948?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>What’s the deal with the Seinfeld soundtrack finally coming out?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="seinfeld" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hHc6IJAscYgh79BroFvgt9OGcs=/0x40:960x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531118/seinfeld.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bi4K7q"&gt;The hottest album of 2021 is about to drop. The soundtrack of the hit ‘90s sitcom &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;will be released on Friday, July 2nd (via &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) on “all digital platforms,” though specific platforms weren’t stated. I expect to hear the bouncy slap bass-driven theme song that never fails to make me laugh blaring out of cars, apartments, and cafes this Fourth of July weekend. Believe it or not, there will be 33 tracks on the album, and it’s apparently the first time that this music will be made available in an official fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgW96K"&gt;The composer, Jonathan Wolff, told &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;that the soundtrack contains some music that was created for the show but never actually appeared in it. Three jazz songs were made for scenes where Elaine (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) goes to see a date playing in a jazz club in the seventh season. The scenes were eventually cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUee3C"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, there’s plenty of variety on the album:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YE7neV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The range of styles is surprisingly broad: hip-hop for “Kramer’s Pimpwalk,” happy whistling and guitars for “Jerry the Mailman,” a “Mission: Impossible” vibe for “Jerry vs. Newman Chase,” suspense-thriller scoring for “Cable Guy vs. Kramer Chase,” ’90s rock for “Kramer’s Boombox,” Eastern mysticism for “Peterman in Burmese Jungle,” and vintage guitar-and-harmonica blues for “Waiting for the Verdict” from the series finale.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="u8K6cv"&gt;But let’s be honest. You, me, and everyone else are just going to absolutely &lt;em&gt;crank &lt;/em&gt;that theme song. Soon it’ll be easier than ever to play at a moment’s notice, but it’s interesting to hear that the now-signature bass groove (which was actually created on a keyboard) and the scat-like sound effects that are sprinkled throughout each episode almost didn’t make the cut. NBC executives said it was “weird, distracting and annoying,” according to the composer in &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/seinfeld-soundtrack-to-be-released-1235009969/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety’s &lt;/em&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipx1PF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;co-creator Larry David had a predictably Larry David-like response: “Larry was deeply offended, and didn’t change anything,” the composer says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GG9HMM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oVldNNHQWVw?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=134&amp;amp;start=134" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s new Live Text feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Grz1iv2Q-EqgdejaZyXhstVLLIM=/311x0:2249x1292/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69531103/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_3.24.37_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xDK9Nx"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;now available in public beta&lt;/a&gt;, which means that today you can try out all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;biggest features coming to the iPhone&lt;/a&gt; this fall. That includes Live Text, the most technically impressive feature in the update, which allows you to pull text, email addresses, phone numbers, and more from pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJ8tcg"&gt;Live Text works with both handwritten and typed text, and supports English, Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Portuguese, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. It’s also important to remember that iOS 15 is still in beta, which means that Apple could tweak or change how Live Text works in the months to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYxEg"&gt;Live Text works in a few different ways on iOS, depending on what you’re trying to use it for and where in the OS you are. Here are all the different ways you can use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYeuj4"&gt;With text fields&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_-4CyMdFNBnctjnp2raX6GOmuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694122/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new “Text from Camera” option in the text select menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SKoALRc81vn5sgQ2uh0tGV3l7Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694125/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How Live Text works when importing text directly into a messaging field.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pwjojp"&gt;The most powerful — and useful — way to use Live Text is with virtually any text field on iOS. Whether you’re writing a text message to a friend, an email, or something in the notes app, you can add text that you copied from an image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WegPR2"&gt;Once you’ve got the text you want (see below), tapping on the text field (as you would when accessing the pop-up select / copy / paste menu that’s been on iOS for years) brings up an additional option: text from camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXuh82"&gt;Tapping that new button will bring up a smaller camera window, which you can point at any block of text. iOS will then highlight the block of text it’s selecting, and you can drop it in just by hitting the “insert” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SY7pXg"&gt;(You might want to proofread things, of course, before you send or post it — Live Text is pretty good, but its not perfect, especially when working with handwritten text.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qX2cWjC_E_3p4yiYCYuyQqOCqV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694093/IMG_2826.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from the camera app’s live preview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6TmP4cBBPKSaemzq6soNwG4k3c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694094/IMG_2825.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text in the Photos app, pulling handwritten text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Db9ALA"&gt;In the camera app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PVkw3d"&gt;If you have an iPhone XS or newer, you can also use Live Text directly in the camera app in real time. Just open the camera app and tap the live text button that appears in the corner of the viewfinder (it’ll pop up contextually when you’re pointing it at text) to grab text that you can then copy and paste. You can also interact with it directly in the case of phone numbers, email addresses, and links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2RbLOQ"&gt;In Photos&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tRNnpQ"&gt;If you’re viewing any pictures with text in them in the Photos app, you can select and interact with text there. It works just like selecting actual text anywhere else on iOS: tap and hold on the text in an image and you’ll see the familiar-looking blue highlights pop up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g-kF4ZNrLZ53OdaTJ_stZRdbRmE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694096/IMG_2827.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text’s “Show Text” option in Safari on iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-bVwPQgkk47K66Xw4fIh44mL0is=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694100/IMG_2824.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Text pulling text from a screenshot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZiGX9k"&gt;In Safari&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hhf0VN"&gt;Text can also be selected directly from images on the web in Safari. To grab text, tap and hold on an image, and hit the “Show Text” button, which will allow you to highlight and interact with text here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big tech companies will have to open Russian offices if they want to advertise in the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Plenary meeting of Russian State Duma" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kXjeA1brgwC9USGx0IBJuCFNEaM=/0x0:4397x2931/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69530985/1233463725.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEa6YN"&gt;A new Russian law will require large social media companies to open offices in Russia if they don’t want to face advertising bans or &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-lawmakers-vote-force-us-tech-giants-open-local-offices-2021-06-17/"&gt;other penalties&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/putin-signs-law-forcing-foreign-it-firms-open-offices-russia-2021-07-01/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The law was reportedly signed by President Vladimir Putin on Thursday and will apply to foreign companies that are “carrying out activities on the internet in Russia.” According to a Russian official, the law affects companies that have over 500,000 Russian visitors a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tvmpjo"&gt;The Russian government has been looking to rein in Big Tech’s influence in the country. In 2019, it introduced a law that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;required device makers to pre-install Russian-made apps&lt;/a&gt; on smartphones, TVs, and computers (with Apple being allowed to instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361762/iphone-russia-startup-local-apps-yandex-mail-ru-law"&gt;show the apps to users during the setup process&lt;/a&gt;). A host of big tech companies, including Facebook and Google, are also facing charges in the country for allegedly not deleting illegal content from their services, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-hits-big-tech-with-new-charges-not-deleting-content-report-2021-06-28/"&gt;according to a report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bOjfej"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Foreign companies having local offices gives governments more leverage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TVqncN"&gt;Foreign companies having local offices gives governments more leverage when it comes to enforcing their rules and regulations, when they may otherwise have fewer tools to do so. For example, in May &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;Twitter’s India offices were raided by the police&lt;/a&gt; after the social network applied a “manipulated media” label to a politician’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8urli"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it had no comment on the law, and Twitter didn’t immediately respond to request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
