    <title>YouTube gives dislikes the thumbs-down, hides public counts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JAirWZ9ULkKMC5lbId49dI2yKU=/49x0:913x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122512/Exvh5P5WUAg5Nwy.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S3u7bx"&gt;YouTube has announced that it’ll be hiding public dislike counts on videos across its site, starting today. The company says the change is to keep smaller creators from being targeted by dislike attacks or harassment, and to promote “respectful interactions between viewers and creators.” The dislike button will still be there, but it’ll be for private feedback, rather than public shaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSpOFu"&gt;This move isn’t out of the blue. In March, YouTube announced that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358992/youtube-hiding-dislikes-experiment-creator-review-bomb"&gt;experimenting with hiding the public dislike numbers&lt;/a&gt;, and individual creators have long had &lt;a href="https://www.the1janitor.com/blog/2018/11/30/why-i-disable-ratings-on-my-youtube-videos"&gt;the ability to hide ratings on their videos&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that the dislike counts will be disappearing for everyone (gradually, according to YouTube) is a big deal — viewers are used to being able to see the like-to-dislike ratio as soon as they click on a video and may use that number to decide whether to continue watching. Now, that will no longer be an option, but it could close off a vector for harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DgloWJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Commenting “I just came here to dislike” may be less satisfying when you don’t see a number go up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KGQZsH"&gt;YouTube says that when it tested hiding dislike numbers, people were less likely to use the button to attack the creator — commenting “I just came here to dislike” was seemingly less satisfying when you don’t actually get to see the number go up. That behavior may still continue to some extent, though, as creators will be able to see the dislike numbers for their own video in YouTube Studio. The company says this still lets well-meaning viewers leave private feedback to content creators or use dislikes to tune the algorithm’s video recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGq2dz"&gt;Other social networks have given users the option to hide rating metrics, too — Instagram and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454428/facebook-instagram-hide-like-counts-feature-now-available"&gt;famously let you hide like counts&lt;/a&gt; if you want to avoid the potential social pressure that comes with having your main measure of success on the platform shown to everyone. It’s not exactly a perfect comparison — the number of likes your YouTube video gets will still be public (if you leave public ratings on), and Instagram hasn’t turned off likes site-wide yet, but it shows a growing concern with what data creators have access to versus what data their audiences have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="to6BTf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube itself has the most disliked video on YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwRna0"&gt;Dislike counts going private could help hide an embarrassing piece of YouTube history: the most disliked video on the entire site is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137894/youtube-rewind-2018-dislike-shane-dawson-logan-paul-pewdiepie-mkbhd-philip-defranco"&gt;the company’s own Rewind from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. That particular recap video sparked so much ire that YouTube recently announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;the annual Rewind videos were canceled&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also an argument that not being able to see public dislikes could lead to users watching a video that’s not very good — an insincere apology, perhaps, or informative-looking content that ends up being an ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJzMu8"&gt;Still, YouTube’s argument that it wants to protect smaller creators from dislike mobs or harassment is one that’s hard to argue against. It’s easy to imagine workarounds for some of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207189/youtube-dislike-attack-mob-review-bomb-creator-insider"&gt;the other ideas it floated to combat that behavior&lt;/a&gt;, which included requiring extra info on why you were disliking the video or graying out the dislike button until you’d watched a certain amount of the video. Instead, people leaving dislikes will be doing so for the creator’s eyes only — and screaming into the void just isn’t the same as publicly booing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Juiced’s new fat-tire electric bike targets a younger generation of riders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tgbsdCFekeiaTm-KNV2ur7DQVjk=/0x216:5184x3672/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122548/Copy_of_PB032678.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B9Q8Hz"&gt;Juiced, the San Diego-based electric bike company known for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22537406/juiced-hyperscrambler-2-ebike-moped-price-specs"&gt;extremely fast, extremely heavy, moped-style cruisers&lt;/a&gt;, wants you to know that its newest model, the RipRacer, is “fun-sized.” Not like tiny-Snickers-bars-you-hand-out-at-Halloween-fun-size, but like a smaller frame size for a younger generation of riders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5Osw6"&gt;Electric bikes are typically marketed and sold to adults, but increasingly, companies are seeing an opportunity around selling bikes to teens and young adults. Juiced is the latest to try its hand at making bikes that are smaller and cheaper than the typical e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pp28PS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful than Juiced’s other hulking models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XjMOkW"&gt;The RipRacer may be fun-sized, but it will no less powerful than Juiced’s other hulking models. It will come in two versions: a Class 2 bike with a 52V/10Ah battery capable of speeds up to 20mph or a Class 3 bike with a 52V/15Ah battery and a top speed of 28mph. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDuyM0kWESpvEyECspm1Bx3Piyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002383/Copy_of_0Q8A1502.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppYHcp"&gt;The Bafang 750W rear-hub geared hub motor is similar to the one found on the company’s Scorpion e-bike. Both the Class 2 and Class 3 models will have pedals with cadence sensors (which deliver power based on how fast you pedal), front and rear lights, and hydraulic disc brakes — all standard features on most e-bikes out today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwMlYp"&gt;For the RipRacer, Juiced has also completely redesigned its battery to be completely water-resistant and to include an integrated Apple AirTag so it never gets lost. The battery has also been reshaped to be easier to handle when removing for charging and will be compatible with a battery docking station that Juiced plans to roll out in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q75wHi"&gt;(Juiced says the docking station will have an inverter for AC power up to 500W, six USB ports, a 12V lighter port, and an LED light. The dock can charge the battery either from AC power or from a solar input.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14DOVPsiq67sg_HLaarR7PAvfRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002384/Copy_of_0Q8A1771.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CD-lh0QFcJxR4oh1y45Q0QwSDxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002410/Copy_of_PB031390.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ESYiAt"&gt;The low-step frame and motorcycle-style handlebars are styled to fit riders 5’0 to 6’3, the company says. The bike is available in four colors: Baja Blue, Noir, Hi-Viz Yellow, and Mystic Green. The Class 2 bike starts at $1,399, while the Class 3 version will sell for $1,599. Interested customers can reserve one today, and the bikes will start to ship in March 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ijBk2a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The minimum age requirement in most countries ranges from 14 to 16 years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Csw9Rk"&gt;The goal in offering a lighter, more nimble, and cheaper e-bike is pretty obvious: younger riders are excited about electric mobility. Of course, some riders are still too young for motorized bikes. The minimum age requirement in most countries ranges from 14 to 16 years, but whether those age limits are actually enforced remains an open question. Shared scooter companies, for example, have struggled to prevent younger riders from using their products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAfjlN"&gt;In fact, Juiced’s hometown of San Diego is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/caught-in-the-act-young-e-bike-riders-breaking-rules-creating-safety-concerns/2695599/"&gt;struggling to keep younger riders safe&lt;/a&gt; amid surging interest in e-bikes. With more customers flocking to e-bikes, many cities are caught flat-footed with out-of-date infrastructure that provides few safe places for people to ride without feeling menaced by cars. If more young people start riding e-bikes, the imperative to build protected bike lanes will grow even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdPfEj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is trying to make its shows go viral with new Twitter partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t2cKKCLCuccCoE6eswVQIh7QWq8=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122499/paramount_plus.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="smMQ1O"&gt;Paramount Plus has announced a new partnership with Twitter centered around better promoting its exclusive shows and events, in addition to hosting three Twitter Watch Parties with fans for “select highly-anticipated original series.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQjv79"&gt;Or, more practically speaking, Paramount Plus would really, really like its shows to be viral on Twitter, with the kinds of trending topics and engagement that ultra-popular shows like HBO’s &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; enjoy on a weekly basis. And what better way to be popular on Twitter than to cozy up to Twitter directly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4T2EB0"&gt;A lot of this deal is deeply boring stuff, things like granting major Paramount Plus shows “Twitter marketing support and brand sponsorship sales rights via Twitter’s Amplify program.” ViacomCBS will also use Twitter for promoting live video, highlights, and Twitter Moments for major events like sports or awards shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="062XUg"&gt;There aren’t a ton of details about which shows or events Paramount Plus is hoping to promote down the line or what episodes or series will be hosted on the watch party. But Paramount Plus does have several big-name shows that might fit the bill, like the upcoming fourth season of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Real World Homecoming: Los Angeles&lt;/em&gt; reunion series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbuEXS"&gt;ViacomCBS has worked with Twitter before — the 2021 BET Awards streamed its red carpet on Twitter, while the 2021 VMAs hosted a live pre-show on the social media service. The new deal will presumably mean more of those sorts of partnerships down the line, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This graphene battery pack charges incredibly fast  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7alZ0X88ARESAFtw_-osCunm2XQ=/63x0:2016x1302/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122368/elecjet_stacked_report_hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra graphene battery charges five times faster than conventional power banks.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra power bank charges five times faster than conventional battery packs&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UppGZP"&gt;Elecjet’s new Apollo Ultra battery pack uses graphene to dramatically speed up charging. Yes, graphene, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17548362/graphene-material-breakthrough-science-technology-hype"&gt;miracle material that has long promised to change the world&lt;/a&gt;, allows this 10,000mAh portable battery to charge from zero to full in less than 30 minutes, about five to six times faster than a conventional power bank of the same capacity. Plug it in when you wake up and the Apollo Ultra should be fully charged by the time you leave the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AckQZ"&gt;Graphene is a highly conductive lattice of carbon only one atom thick. Pure graphene batteries are still too expensive to mass-produce, but the material can already accelerate the charging characteristics of traditional batteries when applied to an electrode in composite form. That’s the approach Elecjet is taking with its new 10,000mAh (40Wh) battery &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-apollo-ultra-3-phone-charges-in-27-mins%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D6b70631c%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launching today on Indiegogo for $65&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6RBu"&gt;In addition to a faster charge rate, Elecjet says the Apollo Ultra will last for more than 2,500 charging cycles before the battery drops below 80 percent health. That’s roughly four to five times longer than conventional lithium-ion battery packs, which would be good for both your wallet and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44FbHa"&gt;I can’t conceivably test the lifespan claim, but Elecjet did send me a review sample of the Apollo Ultra to validate the improved charging speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JH67Q7"&gt;In short, the Apollo Ultra charges fast — &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; fast, just as Elecjet claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QjhUiC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Charges from zero to full in 27 minutes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7epebg"&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is a lithium-polymer battery that’s been enhanced with Real Graphene USA’s proprietary battery technology. It’s fitted with two USB ports: one full-sized USB-A and one USB-C PD 3.0. The USB-C port accepts an input of up to 100W to quickly charge the battery pack. That port is then capable of 65W out, making it powerful enough to charge many USB-C laptops. It supports Samsung’s PPS fast charging tech and holds enough energy to charge a typical phone two or three times. The USB-A port is capable of 18W max output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OE5Ha3"&gt;Fine, but it’s the battery’s charging speed that we’re all here for, and Elecjet says the Apollo Ultra will charge from zero to full in a very impressive 27 minutes when connected to a powerful 100W wall charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="9tAe8o"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Elecjet Apollo Ultra comparison|103965" data-volume-uuid="be818d871" data-volume-id="103965" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-872" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time lapse comparing the Elecjet Apollo Ultra charging speed with a conventional power bank of the same capacity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAOsMX"&gt;My review unit repeatedly charged from zero to 99.9 percent in 27 minutes, using a 100W GaN charger (sold separately for about $50) that Elecjet supplied. It then took another 90 seconds to report 100% on the battery’s display. Elecjet says this is a minor bug, and the battery is “99.999 percent” charged at 27 minutes. The Elecjet Apollo Ultra otherwise charges linearly, reaching 25 percent in 6.5 minutes, 50 percent in 13 minutes, and 80 percent in about 21 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbM7zt"&gt;For comparison, I connected the same 100W charger to a 10,000mAh lithium-ion battery I recently purchased on AliExpress for about $20. It took over three hours to charge from zero to full. That supports Elecjet’s claim that the graphene-enriched Apollo Ultra charges five times faster than conventional battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiZEsw"&gt;I also charged the Apollo Ultra battery from my MacBook’s less powerful 29W charger. The power bank charged from zero to full in 74 minutes. That’s a lot slower, as you’d expect from the weaker charger, but still more than two times faster than the AliExpress battery connected to the 100W charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBDgJ0"&gt;Things got a little odd when trying to charge two devices simultaneously off the Apollo Ultra. My MacBook reported that it was being charged at 65W when connected to the USB-C port. It then dropped to just 5W after I plugged in either an iPhone X or Oppp Find X3 Pro to charge simultaneously from the USB-A port. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-apollo-ultra-3-phone-charges-in-27-mins%23%2Ffaq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Indiegogo campaign FAQ claims&lt;/a&gt; that the Apollo Ultra’s “output power of 87W will be divided between the two devices” so something seems awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5D4mvc"&gt;The Apollo Ultra I’ve been testing warmed up only slightly in the 20 or so times I’ve fully charged and discharged it, while the slow charging lithium-ion reference battery remained cool throughout. “Warm” is commendable considering the Apollo Ultra is drawing more than five times the power, and speaks to graphene’s efficiency at dissipating heat. Elecjet tells me that the Apollo Ultra is fitted with eight safety features and that UL temperature testing never exceeded 42C (107.6F).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dxy4huIheEoyFXc1XOgM-kmInRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001942/verge_DSC_6753_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is slightly thicker than conventional power banks of the same capacity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHMTP"&gt;The Elecjet Apollo Ultra is also chubbier than my reference battery despite holding the same number of electrons. That’s due to the larger power module required to handle the higher input and output wattages. While the unit’s size won’t change for the product that ships to Indiegogo backers, Elecjet tells me that the next-gen power module should allow its future hybrids to match the size of its slower charging predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="9G55DE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQKiKD"&gt;Chinese phone makers are currently embroiled in a fast-charging race of their own. Xiaomi’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675191/xiaomi-11t-pro-lite-120-fast-charging-announced-specs-price"&gt;11T Pro&lt;/a&gt; has a 5,000mAh battery that charges from zero to 100 percent in just 17 minutes with its bundled 120W charger. But that battery is a dual-cell design, allowing both halves to charge simultaneously. That’s fine for $500+ phones with sophisticated chipsets that aren’t limited by the constraints of USB-C PD. Nevertheless, Elecjet matches that 17 minutes charge with its other graphene-enriched battery pack, &lt;a href="https://elecjet.com/products/apollo-traveller-graphene-usb-c-pd-power-bank-5000mah"&gt;the 5,000mAh Apollo Traveller&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvzcAb"&gt;That’s right — the Apollo Ultra isn’t the first graphene hybrid battery pack available to buy. In addition to Elecjet’s offerings, Chargeasap makes a number of hybrid battery packs, including a &lt;a href="https://chargeasap.com/collections/graphene-power-banks"&gt;monster $299 20,000mAh battery pack&lt;/a&gt; that’s also laced with graphene, only with more ports, a wireless charging surface, and higher 100W output. The company says it’ll charge from zero to full in 70 minutes, which sounds about right since it holds twice the juice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUICgy"&gt;These hybrid batteries are an impressive first step by manufacturers on the way to developing the tiny, high capacity, and eco-friendly&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pure graphene batteries we’ve been promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qlY2HI"&gt;Until then, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Felecjet-apollo-ultra-3-phone-charges-in-27-mins%3Fsecret_perk_token%3D6b70631c%26utm_source%3Dprm%26utm_medium%3Dtheverge%26utm_campaign%3Delecjet%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22771702%2Fgraphene-power-bank-review-price-speed" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elecjet Apollo Ultra is priced at $65 on Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; right now&lt;/em&gt;. Elecjet says that anyone who backs the campaign by December 2nd is “guaranteed” to receive the battery pack by Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb improves accessibility search filters for its accommodations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Travel Websites Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAuMADxe8doiDw9s-whsXNkNHGA=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70122314/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lKYJic"&gt;Airbnb has updated its search filters and accessibility review process with the goal of making it easier for people with disabilities to find accommodations on its platform, the company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/accessibility-review/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnpyuM"&gt;Hosts can now submit pictures of the accessibility features in their homes, and “a specialized team of Airbnb agents” will review them to determine if they’re suitable for people with disabilities. On its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Faccessibility&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accessibility review page&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb says that this team works “with engineers, designers, and others across the company” but doesn’t specifically state whether they’re trained or how they’re qualified to recognize accessibility features. It notes that its staff has already reviewed and approved 100,000 accessibility features in 25,000 different homes globally, which CEO Brian Chesky noted on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ERfJuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Accessibility Review: &lt;br&gt;We’re reviewing every accessibility feature on Airbnb for accuracy. To date, our agents have double checked photos of features in more than 25,000 homes. &lt;a href="https://t.co/CfDh808qGM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CfDh808qGM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1458109384144211972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rCcTxa"&gt;Airbnb also updated its search filters for accessibility features. Some filters, like ones for step-free bedroom access and accessible parking spaces, will now be shown more prominently on the search screen. Airbnb made filters pertaining to wide entryways slightly more specific by adding a specific measurement. For example, instead of “wide entrance to bedroom,” Airbnb changed it to “bedroom entrance wider than 32 inches.” As it stands, these 13 filters are still fairly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrXEGT"&gt;Airbnb also announced that it’s making it easier to find accessible Experiences, improving its 11 accessibility filters to allow guests to find activities near their rental that offer features like sign language, provide access to accessible bathrooms, take place on a flat surface, and more. Airbnb is also requiring hosts to submit detailed information about the accessibility measures they’re taking, which then goes under review for “description quality.” Each Experience listing will also clearly show its available accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knKK7y"&gt;In 2017, a study found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/2/15729326/airbnb-disability-discrimination-study"&gt;Airbnb hosts were more likely to reject guests with disabilities&lt;/a&gt;, and in 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17125452/airbnb-disabilities-accommodations-search-filter-travel"&gt;rolled out an accessibility update&lt;/a&gt; adding 21 filters that let guests search for homes with wider entrances, accessible bathrooms, and more. The number of filters has since dropped to 13, which is a bit strange. Previous filters, like “wide clearance to bed,” “accessible height toilet,” and “handheld showerhead,” are now missing from the current list. It remains unclear why Airbnb decided to remove items from its list rather than add more. We reached out to Airbnb with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl0I3z"&gt;Airbnb first started requiring hosts to upload photos of the accessibility features in their stays &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/introducing-new-ways-to-improve-accuracy-of-accessibility-information-for-guests/"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s been long overdue for an update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch SpaceX’s Crew-3 mission to the International Space Station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9Fdq2cbCOno63VPkrLW_l1q9i4=/0x114:3722x2595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70062458/51637033819_8899737def_o.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4ra4r"&gt;SpaceX is launching another crew to space this evening, sending four astronauts to the International Space Station for a six-monthlong stay in orbit. Traveling inside SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft, the crew will get an early start on their mission, with liftoff scheduled for 9:03PM ET on November 10th out of Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5T1RE"&gt;The mission is called Crew-3, and it will carry NASA astronauts Thomas Marshburn, Raja Chari, and Kayla Barron, as well as European Space Agency astronaut Matthias Maurer. This will be the first trip to space for Maurer, Barron, and Chari — the mission’s commander. For Marshburn, this will be his third flight to space, and for each of his missions, he’s flown on a different vehicle. His first flight was on the Space Shuttle and his second flight was on Russia’s Soyuz spacecraft. Now he’ll get to experience the Crew Dragon, which the astronauts have nicknamed “Endurance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erkIUc"&gt;Crew-3 is SpaceX’s third operational crewed flight for NASA as part of the space agency’s Commercial Crew Program — an initiative to use private vehicles to ferry NASA astronauts to and from the International Space Station. As part of its initial contract with NASA, SpaceX is slated to perform up to six crewed flights for the agency, with two flights tentatively scheduled for next year. However, NASA recently indicated it is already thinking of how to transport astronauts beyond those initial missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rkf4Sp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uUrHY9"&gt;While this is SpaceX’s third operational mission, it’s actually the company’s fifth time launching people to orbit on its Crew Dragon spacecraft. In order to prove the Crew Dragon’s safety for NASA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;SpaceX launched two NASA astronauts to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; in May 2020. That first successful test flight paved the way for SpaceX to start doing routine flights with Crew Dragon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmXRG8"&gt;And in September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX launched a crewed flight called Inspiration4&lt;/a&gt; that carried four non-NASA astronauts to orbit. Touted as an all-civilian crew, the passengers included a tech billionaire — who paid for the trip — a childhood cancer survivor, a professor, and an engineer. The foursome, who stayed in orbit for just three days, used the launch as a way to raise charity for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. It was SpaceX’s first truly private human spaceflight mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7AaTft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT TIME IS SPACEX’S CREW-3 LAUNCH?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="czmgig"&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is scheduled to take off on Wednesday November 10th, from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida at 9:03PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d79QSH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 9:03PM / San Francisco: 6:03PM / London: 2:03AM / Berlin: 3:03AM / Moscow: 5:03AM / New Delhi: 7:33AM / Beijing: 10:03AM / Tokyo: 11:03AM / Melbourne: 1:03PM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QcT0EO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW TO WATCH SPACEX’S CREW DRAGON LAUNCH LIVE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NLS82h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Livestream:&lt;/strong&gt; NASA’s livestream coverage can be found &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;on the agency’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Coverage will begin at 4:45PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pih5I7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A NUMBER ONE PROBLEM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="POENO3"&gt;Though Inspiration4 wasn’t a NASA mission, SpaceX learned a few things from that flight that will help with the upcoming Crew-3 trip. The Crew Dragon that flew the Inspiration4 flight operated pretty smoothly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681339/spacex-inspiration4-crew-return-earth-splashdown"&gt;except for one key element&lt;/a&gt; inside the spacecraft: the toilet. SpaceX revealed that a tube in the toilet that transports urine into a storage tank came unglued. This caused urine to spray into the toilet’s fan system instead and pool under the floor. It wasn’t really a problem during the flight itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqaRu5"&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back,” William Gerstenmaier, vice president of build and flight reliability at SpaceX, said during a press conference ahead of flight. “We got the vehicle back, we looked under the floor, and we saw the fact that there was contamination underneath the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DeEBBl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We didn’t really even notice it; the crew didn’t notice it until we got back.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFcVb6"&gt;After seeing this, SpaceX worried that the same problem might be happening on the Crew Dragon used for Crew-2, which was docked with the International Space Station until Monday. Sure enough, the astronauts on the space station went inside that Crew Dragon and found similar urine contamination under the floor of the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hFNFEZz19ju3KBbqe8cZrij2VM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966250/51137531971_c3db77a39c_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: ESA / NASA / Thomas Pesquet&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A glimpse at the toilet inside the Crew Dragon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsOEbW"&gt;The main concern with this pooling is that it’s not just urine collecting under the floor; SpaceX adds a compound to the urine called Oxone, which removes the ammonia from the liquid to help get rid of odor and prevent bacteria from growing. But SpaceX became worried that the mixture of Oxone and urine in the floor could actually corrode the spacecraft itself. The company did tests that involved combining the urine and Oxone mixture with aluminum — the primary metal used to make Crew Dragon — inside a chamber that simulated the same temperature and humidity on board the spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5I071"&gt;The toilet issue was more of a problem on Inspiration4, since the crew spent their entire mission inside Crew Dragon, using the bathroom for multiple days, leading to more potential corrosion. Most of SpaceX’s other Crew Dragon missions send people straight to the International Space Station, so astronauts are typically&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;only using the toilet before docking. Also, SpaceX claims that the aluminum alloy it uses on Crew Dragon is “very insensitive” to corrosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMn9zN"&gt;SpaceX opted to fix the toilet issue anyway by making the toilet an “all-welded structure” so that there are no longer any parts or tubes that can come unglued. That way no unwanted liquids will cause any trouble again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IgarsV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GETTING TO THE PAD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3WYsrg"&gt;Crew-3 is set to take off from SpaceX’s launch site LC-39A at Kennedy Space Center. The crew will then spend a little less than a full day in orbit before rendezvousing with the International Space Station. Crew Dragon is designed to dock autonomously with the ISS, but the astronauts can jump in during the process if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O5u8doCKF4fPM69k5Iljy1QZ4VY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966270/51634067771_6e46bf9d92_o.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / Joel Kowsky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon, at the company’s LC-39A launch site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5A2d4n"&gt;Once Crew-3 arrives, they will join three crew members already on board the ISS: NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonauts Anton Shkaplerov and Pyotr Dubrov. Originally, the incoming crew was supposed to be greeted by a much larger welcoming committee. Four additional astronauts, part of SpaceX’s Crew-2 mission that launched to the space station in April, were meant to be on board when Crew-3 arrived to help pass the baton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPj9sH"&gt;However, the Crew-3 launch has dealt with a number of delays. Originally scheduled for October 31st, the launch was pushed a few days due to bad weather forecasts. Then one of the crew members on Crew-3 developed a minor medical issue, prompting another delay. When that happened, NASA opted to bring the Crew-2 crew home first, worried that waiting any longer would mean landing the astronauts in choppy winter weather off the Gulf Coast. The Crew-2 astronauts safely splashed down off the coast of Pensacola, Florida in their own Crew Dragon on Monday night at 10:33PM ET, in what NASA called a “flawless” undocking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfi6es"&gt;The splashdown of Crew-2, however, didn’t appear to be flawless at first. Just before hitting the water, only three of the capsule’s four parachutes — critical for slowing down the vehicle — appeared to inflate normally. The fourth eventually did inflate, but took about 75 seconds longer than the others. SpaceX claims it removed that parachute right after landing and brought it back to NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida for closer inspection with NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGNZol"&gt;“It performed essentially the way it was designed to perform,” Gerstenmaier said during another press conference last night. “We can land with three parachutes if we have to. This is potentially a known condition that can occur with the four parachutes — one of the four parachutes can be a little slow to deploy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTMhaj"&gt;Ultimately, NASA cleared the way for SpaceX to launch last night, but there is still one last item on the agency’s to-do list. Six hours before takeoff, NASA plans to fire up the International Space Station’s thrusters to move it out of the way of a piece of space debris — a precaution to make sure the vehicle doesn’t suffer any damage. The debris is a leftover fragment from 2007, when China destroyed one of its own satellites in space to prove that it could take out spacecraft in orbit. The test created thousands of pieces of debris, which still seem to be causing a nuisance in orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7LQvY"&gt;However, the avoidance maneuver should not have an impact on today’s launch, which NASA says SpaceX can accommodate. After that, it’ll be time for the Crew-3 astronauts to fly, starting a six-month stay on board the ISS. They’re scheduled to return to Earth sometime in the spring of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1dhIWB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 10th, 11:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post has been updated multiple times to indicate the various launch delays. New information was added about the Crew-2 landing and space debris avoidance maneuver. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbXSoB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro vs. Pixel 6 Pro: what 2,000 photos tell us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wh4LrChgh-_HYNao1Gus5lOdFho=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121885/BFARSACE_FULLFRAME_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k3ztZx"&gt;When the iPhone 13 Pro launched earlier this fall, we said it had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;“best camera” in a smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The larger sensor behind the main wide-angle lens coupled with a wider f/1.5 aperture left us saying, “Whoa, look at this photo,” more often than we were used to. But a few weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, with its 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images, was finally released, proving a worthy competitor for the iPhone 13 Pro’s 12-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4yJQvkwWefcAyltTUEaEUkUjOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957778/akrales_211020_4802_0710.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro has a massive 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ty7jhO"&gt;So this year, in order to settle the score, I set out to take 1,000 photos on each device. I carried them everywhere, annoyed all of my friends by stopping to take photos every other minute, and was ultimately left with a vast range of situations and lighting conditions to compare the photos from these two cameras. Initially, I thought a winner would become obvious around the 200-photo mark, but I quickly realized using these devices was about far more than their end products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ydCHj"&gt;Tune in to my video above, from my camera series &lt;em&gt;Full Frame&lt;/em&gt;, to see what phone ultimately took the gold. Or visit the &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3mFzayJ"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://adobe.ly/3qscBzQ"&gt;Google Pixel 6 Pro’s&lt;/a&gt; 100 best photos gallery to decide a winner for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUcHeR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjmCcc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMTonE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htnkFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAILoq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workplace integration into Microsoft Teams.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Meta&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G7BzNm"&gt;Microsoft is partnering with Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, to integrate Microsoft Teams into Zuckerberg’s Workplace platform. Facebook Workplace, or Workplace by Meta as it’s now been rebranded, will soon integrate Microsoft Teams to livestream video into Workplace groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKpIny"&gt;The Microsoft Teams integration into Workplace will also allow employees using Teams or Workplace to view, comment, and react to meetings in real time without having to switch between apps. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7XnDUE0o7Hb8moXWuXJbF11biU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001970/Meeting_Live_Broadcast.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams and Workplace by Meta integration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GhM3EJ"&gt;Microsoft is also integrating Workplace into Teams, which will enable Teams users to access Workplace content through an app within Teams. The app will be pinned to the Teams navigation bar and will include a homepage of Workplace content. Microsoft Teams admins will also be able to mark content as important to showcase it in the Workplace app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl0Qqp"&gt;“One thing I’ve learned ... there’s not going to be a one and only communications tool on the planet,” says Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration. “People are going to choose a number of tools, so I think it’s on us as responsible vendors to make sure they can integrate and interoperate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDWdss"&gt;This Workplace by Meta and Microsoft Teams integration is the latest in a broader partnership between the two companies. Workplace can already integrate into SharePoint, OneDrive, and Microsoft’s Office 365 suite. Meta has also integrated Workplace into Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory, and it quickly became one of the top 10 apps for the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWocndjtWxZCrFJxV2_UyFctHGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23001973/Stylized_Live_Broadcast.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Meta&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Teams will soon livestream into Workplace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TioQO8"&gt;Microsoft Teams is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684447/facebook-releases-portal-go-plus-video-calling-devices"&gt;arriving on the Meta Portal&lt;/a&gt; (Facebook Portal) device in December, allowing people to use video calling in Teams. This latest Teams and Workplace integration goes live today, with businesses able to share Workplace content to Teams. The livestreaming of Teams meetings into Workplace will be available in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4upkAn"&gt;Microsoft and Meta are also setting the stage to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22758974/microsoft-teams-metaverse-mesh-3d-avatars-meetings-features"&gt;compete for the enterprise metaverse&lt;/a&gt; in the years ahead. Both companies unveiled similar visions for virtual spaces and meetings recently, but given these continued partnerships, we may well see the pair collaborate even further on virtual reality and metaverse efforts in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This affordable robot vacuum is even cheaper right now at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yeedi K650 robot vacuum" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImgF3OzO8n6pM-fi7Jb6HsfDlU=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121641/yeedik650skittles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This isn’t my house. Skittles operate well outside of the five-second drop rule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cLAyaC"&gt;The latest (and even the not-so-new) robot vacuums from iRobot tend to cost, at least, a few hundred dollars. The sky is the limit, so to speak, when it comes to how much these can cost. But there’s a fantastic sale happening at Woot on this affordable model from a company called Yeedi. Its K650 Wi-Fi connected model with an 800-milliliter bin &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142096?sid=VergeDeals111021&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhome.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs just $130 right now&lt;/a&gt;. It’s currently sitting at $180 from Amazon, to give you a sense of how much it usually costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ye8Dz"&gt;This model claims to be great for pet owners, and through its companion app, you can schedule cleaning times, adjust the suction strength, and customize Yeedi’s optional magnetic boundaries, among other things. The Yeedi K650 is compatible with Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dHMlRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10856865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QlaZd2"&gt;If you need more convincing before you buy,&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s resident smart home expert, Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, said this of the K650:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cAURyh"&gt;“For a really basic just-go-do-it, budget bot, the Yeedi is a real bargain and has a huge bin, so you don’t have to empty it as often — you can also &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/products/self-empty-station-yeedi-vac-series"&gt;get a self-empty station to go with it&lt;/a&gt; for another $200. It doesn’t have lidar or virtual boundaries (although there is a more expensive one that does), so you need to &lt;a href="https://www.yeedi.com/collections/accessories/k650"&gt;use magnetic strips&lt;/a&gt; if you want to stop it from going somewhere, but it’s under $200 and it really sucks.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="DHZggk"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad Pro (2020) review: beyond the trackpad|75424" data-volume-uuid="a90d1f137" data-volume-id="75424" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-97" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkdyLY"&gt;And now for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2P86C-1x3o"&gt;something completely different&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro that doesn’t have the M1 processor is $200 off at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553831-REG%2Fapple_mxaw2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $1,300, this sale brings the storage-packed 512GB version down to $1,100. When it originally released, we thought its performance and display were top-notch (it’s still a fantastic device). Its display has True Tone tech that adjusts its color temperature based on your ambient lighting, and it features ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, making your content run smoother than ever. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rW0j6P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="nsX2XE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge Holiday Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cOfUIC"&gt;Another stunning deal is on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Version/dp/B08KXB3R7S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OnePlus 8T, which Amazon has reduced to just $450&lt;/a&gt;, the lowest price ever for this model. The sticker price for this phone typically sits at around $600, but as long as you check the coupon box on the product page before you check out, you can save a grand total of $150. The 8T released about a year ago, and it’s an incremental upgrade over the OnePlus 8. But getting 256GB of storage and a 120Hz display at this price point is an excellent value, especially when you throw its Snapdragon 865 processor into the mix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCkP7g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9741432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk6IGU"&gt;With the impending release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711110/battlefield-2042-next-cross-gen-digital-standard-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on November 19th, it's the perfect time to gear up with this 500GB SSD from Western Digital. This PCIe 4.0 NVMe M.2 SSD has been discounted to $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099GC4CRK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a complimentary code for the upcoming entry in the &lt;em&gt;Battlefield &lt;/em&gt;franchise (a $60 value). This essentially makes the SSD just $30 and is a solid value for 500GB of fast storage. If you want to double the storage, the 1TB version of the drive is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/WD_BLACK-SN750-Internal-Gaming-Solid/dp/B099FNMV34?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $140&lt;/a&gt;. While this SSD is a perfectly suitable option for anyone looking to expand the storage of their desktop or gaming laptop, you’ll need to invest in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;your own heatsink&lt;/a&gt; to attach to it before you install it in your PlayStation 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Noo40"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10753135"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ktnQBs"&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum 3 wireless headphones are some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; on the market today. These headphones normally cost $400, but the black-colored set is down to $248, while the white model is just $241 on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B3MJBW8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which color you like, this is a solid deal and pretty close to the lowest price we’ve seen for these headphones at any retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQoTqn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was pleased with the addition of USB-C charging, as well as the incredibly comfortable design. While we admit that the original price was a bit high for what they offer, the Sennheiser Momentum headphones are a much better value at this price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3fehyd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPSayk"&gt;The delicious-looking Google Nest Mini is currently half price at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1505874-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00781_us_home_mini_charcoal_2nd.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F10%2F22772076%2Fyeedi-robot-vacuum-ipad-pro-sennheiser-oneplus-woot-amazon-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJA2aQnTKB" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/jWQnG5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fga00781us.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals111021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dorama,&lt;/a&gt; bringing the cost down to $25. This isn’t the lowest-ever price we’ve seen on this home assistant speaker, but nevertheless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; called it “a great sounding upgrade over the Home Mini.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KePwx7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736399"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tO18cA"&gt;A couple of other deals to check out...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gkTdGt"&gt;Save $100 on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07JZ6MTC4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eufy RoboVac 12 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $140. Not quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this device, but it’s still a solid deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Yl4f8"&gt;Amazon is currently offering &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/hz/subscribe/ku" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;four months of Kindle Unlimited for just $5&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $40 for a four-month subscription, this service grants you access to over 1 million books, thousands of audiobooks, and monthly issues of your favorite magazines. All of these features are accessible on any Kindle device or via the Kindle app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="JIPmhh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Latest iOS beta lets you manually scan for sneaky AirTags</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A bunch of AirTags" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JlpL7ZBOcfluDDeusfpsZTsseOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70121343/vpavic_4547_20210421_0131.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTags were released earlier this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkeFzN"&gt;Among the features added to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/"&gt;iOS 15.2’s second beta&lt;/a&gt; is a new option in the Find My app that lets you manually scan your surroundings for AirTags and other Find My-enabled devices that someone might be using to track you. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is accessible via a new “Items That Can Track Me” option listed in the Find My app’s Items menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a5TOm"&gt;Hit the link, and the app will report if there are any devices nearby that aren’t owned by you and which have Apple’s tracking technology enabled. The app can then give instructions on how to disable the device. Alternatively, there’s a “Help Return Lost Items” option for items that have ended up in your vicinity accidentally rather than maliciously, which replaces the previous “Identify Found Item” text.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAfBVZs-g2ti8bb7fk-Yq0K34DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23002055/apple_unknown_items_scan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature is accessible from the “Items That Can Track Me” menu item.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45ZZxa"&gt;AirTags are designed to let you keep track of items like keys or a bike in case they’re lost or stolen. The new beta feature is Apple’s latest attempt to assuage critics &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/review/apple-airtags-review"&gt;who quickly pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that the tiny AirTags are &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;pretty good at tracking people and identified some shortcomings in the safety features Apple included at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHA2fa"&gt;In June, Apple announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516178/apple-airtags-tracking-devices-update-play-sound-privacy-android-app"&gt;initial series of measures&lt;/a&gt; to address these concerns. So rather than waiting until an AirTag had spent three whole days away from its owner before emitting a warning chime, AirTags now do so after just eight to 24 hours. Apple also announced that it is building an app for Android users to alert them to the presence of unwanted trackers and said that it would be launching later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjZ5xN"&gt;Other tweaks that have arrived with iOS 15.2’s second beta include the introduction of the Legacy Contact feature Apple announced at WWDC 2021, which lets loved ones access your account and personal information in the event of your death. The &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/apple-messages-communication-safety-ios-15-2/"&gt;Communication Safety feature for the Messages app is also returning&lt;/a&gt;, although it now won’t notify a parent when nudity is detected in an image. It’ll just blur the image and offer safety resources. There’s also a new Hide My Email option in the mail app, and the interface of the Apple TV app has been tweaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ERa1d"&gt;As with every iOS beta, however, there’s always that chance that any one of these features may be tweaked or removed entirely before its stable release.&lt;/p&gt;
