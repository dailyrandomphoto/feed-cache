    <title>Activision shrinks Call of Duty file sizes so you can download other games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFnPATJ59ltI0m8yasumTHHe1qQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044601/AGB_WZ_BR_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WLlKY5"&gt;Activision is finally doing something about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;the tremendous file sizes&lt;/a&gt; of recent &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; games. &lt;a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/03/Season-Two-Reloaded-Warzone-File-Size-Reduction#MWandWarzoneFileSize"&gt;The company is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that both &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare &lt;/em&gt;and the free-to-play &lt;em&gt;Warzone &lt;/em&gt;will be much easier on hard drives after the next update. The space savings vary depending on what platform the game is installed (and which content packs you have installed), but they’ll be at least 30GB if you have both full games installed — meaning you’ll actually have enough room to install another AAA game if you like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzq2Hn"&gt;The update is set to be released on March 30th, but while it may be easier on your hard drive, downloading it won’t be easy on your internet connection. Activision says the one-time Season Two Reloaded update will be larger than usual (up to 57GB for those who just play &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt;). The good news is that future updates shouldn’t be as big, but you will want to mind your data caps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0OE8I"&gt;According to the blog post, the space savings come from file optimizations and “streamlining content packs.” It’s also worth noting that individual content packs can be removed, getting rid of game modes you don’t play. For example, you can uninstall single player and Special Ops if you only fire up &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; to play with friends. The blog post mentions that some users will have to reinstall content packs to get the optimized versions, but Activision wasn’t immediately available to comment on the circumstances that would cause that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvQGb9"&gt;The specific space savings for each platform are listed below, but to add some context, let’s imagine you’ve got &lt;em&gt;Warzone&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Modern Warfare&lt;/em&gt; installed on your PlayStation 4. After the update, you’ll have freed up enough space to install &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt; (4.2GB) and &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; (26.3GB) — which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350340/ps4-ps5-games-sony-astro-bot-rescue-mission-play-at-home-psvr"&gt;now both free on the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is betting big on Google’s Android services: RCS, YouTube TV, Pixel, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 5 in “Sorta Sage” green" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkBer63LTPctRN6fpc5LooDif9s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044383/akrales_201012_4137_0117.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DTBIdh"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are announcing a huge partnership today, with the carrier agreeing to showcase a suite of Google’s services on Android phones sold on the carrier’s network. The list includes officially supporting Google’s Android Messages (with RCS) app on all of T-Mobile’s Android phones, dropping T-Mobile’s own TV services for Google’s YouTube TV, showcasing Google One as the default backup service, and expanding support and sales of Google hardware like the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwYqkZ"&gt;T-Mobile and Google say the carrier has “the most Android smartphone customers in the US.” With this big partnership, those customers will have a phone that is more likely to showcase native Google services instead of less-well-supported services from the carrier or manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFNKtp"&gt;It’s also a big win for Google, which will finally see another US carrier besides Verizon take a real shot at promoting the Pixel line of phones. Pixel sales in the US have not reached any sort of real critical mass, though they’ve done better since Google started selling less-expensive versions like the 3A and 4A. Early on, Verizon was the premier partner, but it never materialized into big numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46l3wu"&gt;But the biggest news is probably that T-Mobile is winding down its Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services in favor of YouTube TV. T-Mobile customers get $10 off that service, and there will be various other offers, including three months free of YouTube Premium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22121019"&gt;More on that deal (and the surprising decision to wind down T-Mobile’s own TV streaming service) here from Chris Welch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="etJqKX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;RCS takes another baby step toward becoming the default&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b7FAE0"&gt;For messaging, it’s yet another step forward in the long, convoluted, and harrowing journey to normalize the next-gen RCS standard across the US. Just this past January, some strange backroom dealings meant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices shipped with Samsung Messages as the default&lt;/a&gt; in the US, while most of the rest of the world got Android Messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYt9du"&gt;Samsung phones on T-Mobile &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; use Android Messages as the default in the future, as will every other Android phone T-Mobile sells. Google says the switchover will happen by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ruRF4y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is rolling out end-to-end encryption for RCS in Android Messages beta ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"},{"title":"Google is finally taking charge of the RCS rollout&amp;amp;nbsp;","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681573/google-rcs-chat-android-texting-carriers-imessage-encryption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zz0VYP"&gt;Google is also providing a small update on its ongoing effort to support secure end-to-end encryption for RCS on Android Messages. It reiterated that the rollout for beta testers already started and that it “will continue throughout 2021.” Fully encrypted chat for 1:1 messages for RCS is currently only supported inside Android Messages, so T-Mobile’s decision to make it the standard will mean that more people will have it made available to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBU8ge"&gt;Google and T-Mobile are also announcing plans to “build a messaging business together.” That’s a reference to RCS’s ability to be used for business chat — just as you can with iMessage or WhatsApp for some businesses. It’s one of the things that originally seemed like it might be a big driver for adoption since there’s money to be made on the backend as businesses pay for the service, but it hasn’t reached its potential yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Etp1bY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Verizon didn’t do much for Google’s Pixel phones, but maybe T-Mobile will&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOemtC"&gt;Last and perhaps least, T-Mobile is adopting Google One’s cloud storage as the default backup service for Android phones. Unlike with TV, it doesn’t appear there will be any discounts on offer. Custom online storage solutions from carriers are a notoriously annoying piece of crapware installed on Android phones — just ask any Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customer who bought their phone from their carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raB1nC"&gt;When asked for comment, Google says it isn’t “disclosing the financial terms of this deal.” Google and T-Mobile already have a pre-existing relationship, as T-Mobile is the network that supports Google’s MVNO, Google Fi. This new deal doesn’t change anything for Fi customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSRKmA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is already shutting down its live TV service, partners with YouTube TV and Philo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkjNGeYXyH83iWeu69Bj9WlB2G4=/179x0:2249x1380/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044385/Screen_Shot_2021_03_29_at_3.19.01_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pzT0Ue"&gt;Only five months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535264/tmobile-tvision-live-internet-tv-streaming-service-price"&gt;announcing its TVision streaming service&lt;/a&gt;, T-Mobile today shared news that TVision’s three bundles of live channels will all shut down at the end of April. The development comes as part of T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22120959"&gt;new partnership with Google and YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, which it’s making out to be a huge deal. The carrier says YouTube TV will now fill the role of its “live TV solution.” It’s also positioning Philo TV as the replacement for its base offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6Up7y"&gt;The Live, Live Plus, and Live Zone services that were available with TVision will go dark on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWpsbg"&gt;T-Mobile is giving a free month of YouTube TV to customers who had signed up for one of the TVision Live packages, and all T-Mobile subscribers will be eligible to save $10 on the usual monthly rate of $64.99; so if they want the service, it’ll cost $54.99 per month. They can also get three free months of YouTube Premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VIIhE"&gt;“YouTube TV is a leader in this space,” T-Mobile said in today’s press release. “It offers the same great flexibility, robust content and convenience that TVision customers love.” The message is clear: T-Mobile is teaming up with a company that has been in this game longer and is already familiar with everything it takes to make streaming, watch-anywhere TV work — even if it feels like the costs keep climbing higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkan9Q"&gt;In what comes off as an attempt to sugarcoat a short-lived misstep, T-Mobile says its “TVision initiative was launched to give customers new choices and help millions cut the cord, while expanding appeal for the company’s forthcoming wireless home Internet service.” That doesn’t quite match the usual brazen “Uncarrier” tone that &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201027005931/en/"&gt;T-Mobile had back in October&lt;/a&gt;, when CEO Mike Sievert said “just like we changed wireless for good, now we’re gonna change TV for good.” At the time, T-Mobile said TVision Live was “a total game-changer for anyone who wants live news and sports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYIAnX"&gt;Siefert has now changed his tune. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fturns-out-tv-is-better-with-friends&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In a blog post today&lt;/a&gt;, he acknowledged that TV is better “with friends,” and went into more detail into what led to T-Mobile’s revamped approach:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4znjJL"&gt;This shift may surprise some given last year’s TVision streaming services launch. But innovation seldom follows a straight line. Since launching the TVision initiative, we’ve learned a lot about the TV industry, about streaming products, and of course, about TV customers. We also saw trends that made us take a fresh look at how to best do in video what we always do: put customers first. With our TV software provider encountering some financial challenges and with our broader, strategic partnerships with Google and Philo, we saw an opportunity to deliver unique value to our customers and strengthen the TVision initiative with the best partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VKXEW"&gt;This industry is incredibly fragmented, with new streaming services launching all the time, and we’ve concluded that we can add even more value to consumers’ TV choices by partnering with the best services out there, negotiating incredible streaming media deals for T-Mobile customers, and helping our customers navigate the increasingly complex streaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="O8PqJk"&gt;Siefert describes the new arrangement as “a big upgrade,” adding that “YouTube TV offers more than twice as many channels as TVision Live, and Philo offers nearly twice as many channels as TVision Vibe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vCCJ3h"&gt;TVision Live had started at $40 / month, with Live Plus and Live Zone each increasing by another $10. As other internet TV providers know, it’s unlikely that T-Mobile would’ve been able to hang on to those lower tiers for long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeLpTJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fvibe&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Vibe&lt;/a&gt; — a $10-per-month service that provides on-demand access (but not live streams) to shows from AMC, Discovery, MTV, and other networks — is also being phased out. Same goes for TVision Channels, which lets customers aggregate their subscriptions from Showtime, Stars, and Epix. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftvision%2Fservices%2Fhub&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F29%2F22356978%2Ft-mobile-tvision-live-plus-zone-shutting-down-youtube-tv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TVision Hub 4K streaming dongle&lt;/a&gt; will remain available, and it sounds like YouTube TV will now get a prominent spot on that device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51iACF"&gt;You can look at this as a retreat on T-Mobile’s part, but I think its decision is probably the right one. YouTube TV remains the streaming TV service to beat, and there just wasn’t enough about TVision to make it stand out among YTTV and other competitors. Any price advantage was never going to last. Above all else, T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297311/tmobile-5g-mid-band-magenta-max-unlimited-data"&gt;still touting its strong 5G network advantage&lt;/a&gt;, as evidenced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max data plan&lt;/a&gt; it announced in late February. The plan is the only one among major carriers to lift any deprioritization limits on data usage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump is no moon; it’s a space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qof00Ruf3W4wwrDibD6jXJ64w-Q=/0x63:1500x1063/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69044009/mi_11_bump3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a lot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Xiaomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WgYQp"&gt;We were warned. But as is so often the case, our feeble minds couldn’t fully grasp it until it was staring us in the face. We saw the Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280166/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-leak-front-screen-display-specs"&gt;pre-announcement unboxing video&lt;/a&gt;, so we knew what was likely in store: an absolutely massive bump with three rear-facing cameras next to a 1-inch screen. But now that the phone has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356128/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-lite-5g-announced-specs"&gt;officially launched&lt;/a&gt; and we’ve seen it from more angles, we can confirm that it is actually the Death Star of camera bumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vft2dQ"&gt;What’s most striking is the bump’s unapologetic thickness. This isn’t a design that tries to minimize its appearance or meld it into other elements of the phone, a la the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it’s a major contributor to the device’s overall 8.38mm thickness. It’s practically halfway to a &lt;a href="https://www.dpreview.com/articles/6801580015/sonyt77t700"&gt;2008 Sony Cybershot point-and-shoot&lt;/a&gt; glued to the back of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C6aIG7Uz4jvVvu2nxcqsWzkqdh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22405941/mi_11_bump11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Imag&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;e: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top and bottom views of the Mi 11 Ultra’s camera bump and the phone attached to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XMnCUP"&gt;The bump’s standout feature — that little 1-inch OLED — no doubt requires a thicker design than your average display-less array. And let’s not forget the cameras themselves, starting with a 50-megapixel wide angle with a very large 1/1.2-inch sensor that’s just a shade smaller than the 1-inch sensor you’ll find in dedicated cameras like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20995864/sony-rx100-mark-vii-camera-review-price-specs-features-microphone-jack"&gt;Sony RX100 VII&lt;/a&gt;. That big sensor potentially offers better light-gathering capabilities than a more conventionally sized one, especially considering it’s combined with a relatively fast f/1.95 lens. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RBsULfgwB63DBbs6uwx6B6qq7Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406043/xiaomi_bump.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bump is big, but so is the main camera sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb8x7l"&gt;There’s also a 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide and a 48-megapixel f/4.1 periscope-style 5x optical zoom. That’s not on quite the same level as the S21 Ultra’s four rear-facing cameras (plus an autofocus sensor), but it’s still plenty of hardware to house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZpE5"&gt;The camera bump is, without question, enormous. But it’s not just big for the sake of being big, though. Its screen and uncommonly large main camera are potentially really useful. Will we ever see a more mainstream device with a camera bump this, for lack of a better term, chonky? Probably not. This 6.8-inch device is probably the best venue to debut these features since users already know they’re getting a big device. The rest of us can just marvel at what an astonishing technological feat it is. Truly more machine than man.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet &amp; Clank is currently free, and it’s getting a PS5 update, too</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4VlBc"&gt;Insomniac Games’ 2016 remake of &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular first-party exclusives released during the PS4’s life span. And today, the developer announced that the game will receive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1376580160875495427?s=20"&gt;a next-gen optimization patch sometime next month&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the PS5’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPpuL9"&gt;The new update will allow PS5 owners to run the game at 60 frames per second. If you own a PS4 copy digitally or physically, you will receive the update free of charge. Additionally, the update will be available for users who play &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4TF9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank (2016) will be playable in 60 FPS on PS5 after a new update in April! As part of the Play at Home campaign, download the game for free now through 3/31. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RatchetPS4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RatchetPS4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Iw6CMNByFU"&gt;https://t.co/Iw6CMNByFU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/VEFiW3IMWK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VEFiW3IMWK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1376580160875495427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pR7zTq"&gt;The patch comes at an interesting time for the &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt; franchise as the game’s highly anticipated sequel, Rift&lt;em&gt; Apart&lt;/em&gt;, is slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278233/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date"&gt;release as a PS5 exclusive on June 11th&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;the 2016 remake is currently free to own&lt;/a&gt; as part of Sony’s “Play at Home” initiative with the offer available until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM ET. No PS Plus subscription is required to redeem. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s latest patch fixes hundreds of bugs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-WATTvq5GOOYmUC7rB3VVuDdP6M=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69043566/ss_ae4465fa8a44dd330dbeb7992ba196c2f32cabb1.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0satWL"&gt;CD Projekt Red released an update for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;with hundreds of bug fixes. Patch 1.2, a 34GB or more download depending on platform, is live on PC and consoles, with a Stadia update coming later this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eT92Bf"&gt;Fixes range from quality-of-life improvements to game-crashing bugs, including improvements to vehicles, police forces, NPC behavior, quests, and much more. The &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37801/patch-1-2-list-of-changes"&gt;full list&lt;/a&gt; is available on the game’s website. CD Projekt Red released its first major patch in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;January&lt;/a&gt;, an update it said “lays the groundwork” for future fixes. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340232/cyberpunk-2077-1-2-patch-fixes-police-driving-dodging-issues"&gt;latest patch&lt;/a&gt; was delayed after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274035/cd-projekt-hack-source-code-cyberpunk-2077-witcher-3-encrypt-data-ransom"&gt;hackers&lt;/a&gt; accessed the developer’s internal network, forcing the developer to push the release back to late March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7vmG9"&gt;CD Projekt Red’s work is far from done. The game’s launch late last year has been nothing short of disastrous. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt;’s release included widespread bugs across several platforms. Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled&lt;/a&gt; the game from its online stores in December of last year and began issuing full refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toSLHZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suXhvG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is closing its PlayStation Store for PS3 in July and Vita in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PS3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QeJXfnsSIHk_S0uo1GG9b7I_h-k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69043509/vpavic_191205_untitled_0018_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qOKmOj"&gt;Sony is officially closing its PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 on July 2nd, with the store shuttering for Vita devices on August 27th. &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/important-notice/"&gt;The shutdowns&lt;/a&gt; mean you’ll no longer be able to purchase digital copies of games or DLC for the PS3 and Vita. Sony is also removing the remaining purchase functionality for its PlayStation Portable (PSP) on July 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkYrbj"&gt;Thankfully, you’ll still be able to download and play previously purchased games, videos, and media content. The only thing that’s changing, at least for now, is that you won’t be able to purchase PS3, PS Vita, or PSP digital games and videos. In-game purchases will also stop after the stores are closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fPPM4"&gt;You’ll also still be able to purchase cross-buy content following the closures, allowing you to access the PS3 and PS Vita / PSP versions of games that come with cross-buy support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS Vita (stock)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gk2Vfz-YHTOJxPm9tbckoz_MOOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/3080777/PS_Vita_stock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s PS Vita.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="g1Kwoh"&gt;News of the closures originally surfaced last week from &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/ps3-vita-psp-stores-permanently-closed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TheGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and many had feared the closures would prevent people from downloading games to their devices. That’s clearly not the case, which is good news if you still own a PS3, PSP, or Vita and you want to continue accessing your games. The only thing that’s really changing here is you won’t be able to buy new digital games and content unless the games have cross-buy support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fb6YO"&gt;Sony’s PS3 originally launched in November 2006, and more than 80 million units of the console were sold in total. The Vita didn’t fare as well, with over 10 million units sold in total, but the PSP was a hit with more than 80 millions sold during its 10-year lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB of storage for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, but only in space gray. Or you can buy it for as low as $320 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (space gray only). If you need more space to store things like apps, you can grab a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J5J7BF1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model for $395&lt;/a&gt; in select colors, which is $29 off its usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for as low as $385 at Amazon (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD48RS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; only) or for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$394 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; in gold only.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or just $1 more, you can get this model in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="gwJ9Lp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air (2020) review: take it from the Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ByT0LP"&gt;The best deal you can currently get on the iPad Air fourth-gen is at Micro Center. The retailer has the most competitive sale price right now at $540, where you can grab a 64GB model in all five colors (&lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628782/apple-ipad-air-4---green-(late-2020)"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628780/apple-ipad-air-4---rose-gold-(late-2020)"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628779/apple-ipad-air-4---silver-(late-2020)"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628781/apple-ipad-air-4---sky-blue-(late-2020)"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/628778/apple-ipad-air-4---space-gray-(late-2020)"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594487-REG%2Fapple_myfq2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Sky-Blue%2F462727496%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; currently have the fourth-gen iPad Air 64GB model with Wi-Fi in all colors for $559. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn6zsS"&gt;The 256GB configuration has also been discounted in all color variants at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J63W44Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $679, which is $70 off its usual price of $749. Additionally, B&amp;amp;H also has the model in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594492-REG%2Fapple_myfy2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue available for $679&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart has a sale on the iPad Air 256GB for as low as $699 if you buy it in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Rose-Gold%2F902065600%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Sky-Blue%2F483096080%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sky blue&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford stops sales of its home charging station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZthE9ovJdXwmkm7LP1sQ9KTpVk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042946/sokane_210125_4386_1835.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjVKwx"&gt;Ford has stopped selling its Level 2 home chargers for the Mustang Mach-E after discovering some weren’t working, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvS250"&gt;The issue, which was &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/sales/ford-halts-sales-its-home-ev-chargers"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has to do with the wall-box chargers registering a fault and stopping charging altogether. Ford says there are no safety concerns, but it decided to stop selling the $800 home charging stations at the end of February until it figures out the problem. Mach-E owners can still charge their electric Mustangs using 120V or 240V outlets at home, or at public charging stations. (Owners who run into any issues can call Ford at &lt;a href="tel:(800)%20392-3673"&gt;(800) 392-3673&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIfax"&gt;Ford’s 48-amp Level 2 charger (officially called the Ford Connected Charge Station)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is able to put around 28 miles of range back into the Mustang Mach-E battery pack per hour, about eight miles more per hour than you’d get plugging into a 240V outlet. While some automakers that sell electric vehicles sell these chargers (which also require an installation process), there’s a growing list of third-party options. According to the &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt; report, some dealers are turning to Amazon in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYTeV5"&gt;More than 4,000 Mustang Mach-E SUVs have shipped to customers in North America so far, though the home charger issue is not the first hiccup in Ford’s rollout. Ford delayed shipping some of the earliest deliveries in order to do extra quality checks, and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;recalled a few dozen&lt;/a&gt; that were already out in the world due to loose subframe bolts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power sports company BRP will make electric watercraft, go-karts, and motorcycles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CdpXG88y7CXd3d9i2BUj_1rn_QY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69042771/Picture2_rev_3x2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrEAZz"&gt;Canadian power sports firm BRP announced that it would spend $300 million to electrify its entire lineup of vehicles by 2026. The company, which manufacturers watercraft, snowmobiles, ATVs, and go-karts, will start rolling out its first products in the next two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7m7Wl"&gt;The $13 billion global power sports market is slowly coming around to electric drivetrains, and BRP, which owns popular brands like Ski-Doo snowmobiles, Sea-Doo watercraft, Ryker ATVs, and Rotax go-karts, is trying to position itself at the forefront of the movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyPrD3"&gt;“We have always said electrification was not a question of ‘if’ but a question of ‘when,’” said José Boisjoli, BRP president and CEO, in a statement. “Today, we’re very excited to unveil more details of our plan to deliver market-shaping products that will enhance the consumer experience by offering new electric options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xYggzx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have always said electrification was not a question of ‘if’ but a question of ‘when’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32VIrE"&gt;BRP will use a “modular electric power pack” developed by its sub-brand, Rotax, across its new lineup of electric power sports vehicles. To accommodate the new production commitment, the company will spend some of its $300 million retrofitting Rotax’s assembly facility in Austria, as well as building a brand-new electric vehicle development center in Quebec, where BRP is headquartered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFUMnT"&gt;This won’t be BRP’s first time developing electric vehicles. In 2019, the company acquired Alta Motors, an electric motorcycle manufacturer, and introduced its first EV, the Rotax Sonic e-kart, which is currently in use at the &lt;a href="https://www.rotax.com/en/news/latest/detail/welcome-to-the-rotax-max-dome.html"&gt;Rotax Max Dome in Linz, Austria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct1dnk"&gt;BRP isn’t the only power sports company racing to develop more electric vehicles. Polaris and Zero Motorcycles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21473587/polaris-zero-motorcycles-electric-ev-off-road-vehicle-snowmobiles"&gt;partnering to co-develop electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22302725/polaris-electric-ranger-utv-zero-teaser"&gt;ATVs and snowmobiles&lt;/a&gt;. Electric trucking company Nikola Motor has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18411541/nikola-wave-electric-jet-ski-4k-display-cruise-control"&gt;concept versions of an electric watercraft and an electric off-roader called the NZT&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has also teased an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain"&gt;electric ATV called the Cyberquad&lt;/a&gt;. And Volkswagen has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18250047/vw-electric-dune-buggy-geneva-auto-show-2019"&gt;revealed plans to make an electric dune buggy&lt;/a&gt;, the ID Buggy, which is based on the old Meyers Manx kits from the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;
