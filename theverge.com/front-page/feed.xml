    <title>Clubhouse is no longer invite-only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKHB35Lk5kjnpFYyCfpHrJUOluc=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612529/clubhousenewlogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XV6Gcb"&gt;Clubhouse is going wide. Co-founders Paul Davison and Rohan Seth announced today that the app is no longer invite-only. Around 10 million people are currently on the waitlist, a spokesperson confirms, and they’ll slowly be added to the app over time. (Essentially, millions of users won’t be added today, but seemingly, if you attempt to sign up anew, you’ll be able to do so.) Along with the news, Clubhouse showed off a new logo, as well as a new app icon: Justin “Meezy” Williams, rapper 21 Savage’s manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5U2C6"&gt;“The invite system has been an important part of our early history,” a blog post about the changes says. “By adding people in waves, welcoming new faces each week in our Wednesday Orientations, and talking with the community each Sunday in Town Hall, we’ve been able to grow Clubhouse in a measured way, and keep things from breaking as we’ve scaled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYazJs"&gt;This change comes only a week after Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576771/clubhouse-dm-backchannel-update-message"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its DM product, Backchannel, which the team now says saw 10 million messages sent within the first day of launch, and more than 90 million over the first week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8U9Mp"&gt;Of course, the app opening up comes amid increasing competition. As Clubhouse built out its product and acquired a waitlist, other social audio products, like Twitter Spaces, opened to everyone. If Clubhouse wants to compete, and keep acquiring new users, it’ll have to make sure everyone can actually access it. Part of that journey was bringing the app to Android, in addition to iOS, and now it’s completed the second major step, which is removing any gating around new user signup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WHO head cheers Olympic ‘hope’ as COVID-19 cases in athletes’ village rise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Before the Tokyo Olympics" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQzk6Q-vEXHQ-jWGH9UjbrVvUHE=/0x223:6633x4645/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612289/1234022012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kappeler/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jVJpmA"&gt;Olympic athletes in Tokyo continue to test positive for COVID-19 &lt;a href="https://gtimg.tokyo2020.org/image/upload/production/rbhzrrsabvocck506t2s.pdf"&gt;by the dozens&lt;/a&gt;, the United States gymnastics team &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/20/u-s-womens-gymnastics-team-bolts-olympic-village/?utm_source=NYPTwitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialFlow"&gt;left the Olympic Village&lt;/a&gt; for a hotel in an attempt to avoid the virus, and the chief of the games’ organizing committee said there &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/31847805/tokyo-2020-organizing-committee-chief-rule-cancellation-summer-olympics"&gt;could still be a last-minute cancellation&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the head of the World Health Organization said Wednesday that the Tokyo Olympics could “inspire” and “bring the world together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nzp9LH"&gt;“It is my sincere hope the Tokyo Games succeed,” said WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday. He said it was impossible to expect zero cases of COVID-19, and that the most important thing would be to isolate people, contact trace, and stop the virus from spreading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t78KYz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"Beyond competition, medals &amp;amp; records, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tokyo2020?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Tokyo2020&lt;/a&gt; Games bring the nations of the   together in celebration of sport, health, excellence, friendship &amp;amp; respect. But ultimately, they are a celebration of something that our   needs now, more than ever:     "-&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrTedros?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DrTedros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— World Health Organization (WHO) (@WHO) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1417654668776415235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXwzQ3"&gt;His optimism around the games stands in contrast to the Japanese medical community, which has called for the Olympics &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/olympics-tokyo-covid-19-1.6032206"&gt;to be canceled&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 cases are rising in Japan, and only around a third of medical providers are vaccinated. The games offer a chance for the virus to spread and are a risk to the health of the athletes and people in the community. Still, it’s a risk the WHO seems to think is reasonable to take, even as Ghebreyesus said that governments should commit to public health measures in the face of rising case counts. “If we throw caution to the wind, it will blow back in our faces,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1417650711203139593"&gt;also said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3CJLO"&gt;The WHO has a close relationship with the International Olympic Committee that stretches back decades. The two groups signed their first memorandum of understanding &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-who-strengthen-ties-to-advocate-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;in 1984&lt;/a&gt;. They reaffirmed that partnership in a &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/07-01-2011-who-and-the-international-olympic-committee-sign-agreement-to-improve-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;2010&lt;/a&gt; memorandum focused on promoting healthy lifestyles, and signed another &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-and-who-strengthen-ties-to-advocate-healthy-lifestyles"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoSbBq"&gt;Experts worried about the relationship ahead of the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, which were held as the Zika virus — which the WHO called a Public Health Emergency of International Concern — spread through Brazil. A group of physicians called for the games to be moved or rescheduled and said &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2016/05/Zika-Olympics-Open-Letter-to-WHO-current2.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_17"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; that they did not feel the WHO was appropriately assessing the risks of the virus. “We are concerned that WHO is rejecting these alternatives because of a conflict of interest,” the letter read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B91Pk7"&gt;The WHO’s support of the Tokyo Olympics also creates the appearance of conflict, wrote MacIntosh Ross, an assistant professor of sports management at Western University in Canada, &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-who-and-the-ioc-are-playing-with-lives-at-state-of-emergency-tokyo-olympics-164291"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;The Conversation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The stakes of holding the games during a pandemic are high for people in Japan, but the IOC stands to benefit financially if they go ahead, he wrote — and &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-olympic-games-2020-tokyo-olympics-dd49a7aaaa6c59defea9670c5b19475c"&gt;lose billions&lt;/a&gt; if they don’t. It’s disconcerting to have even the suggestion that the WHO’s concerns aren’t first with the community in Tokyo. Yet, Ross adds: “When the IOC and WHO support a global mega-event held during a pandemic, it’s difficult to believe that the well-being of the host nation remains a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaHFvD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will let devs compete for your Echo Show’s screen and everything else Alexa just added</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AD75v4DQ6ctAAUWJk9-vczmNpZ0=/0x25:1404x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612096/alexa_widgets.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I6uOeH"&gt;Amazon’s Alexa devices are &lt;em&gt;ambient&lt;/em&gt; computers, not the kind you use all day. When you&lt;em&gt; do&lt;/em&gt; ask your Echo a question or glance at your Echo Show’s diminutive screen, the voice assistant only has a brief chance to impress. Today, Amazon is announcing it’s going to give more of those opportunities to third-party developers — including brand-new widgets and featured skill cards that might take up a chunk of your smart speaker’s precious real estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0exM6"&gt;Here’s what to expect from those and everything else the company’s announcing at its Alexa Live event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYKWVP"&gt;As you can see in Amazon’s mockup above, &lt;strong&gt;widgets&lt;/strong&gt; look pretty much as you might expect. In a blog post, Amazon describes them as “rich, customizable, glanceable, self-updating views of skill content” where you can check items off a to-do list or activate a skill’s functions, without needing to say “Alexa” first. It’s not yet clear how limited they are or if they might effectively be a way to build a touchscreen app for an Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IOG98N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developers don’t have to pay for Amazon’s Alexa skill ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FltnSl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Featured skill cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;might be slightly controversial, depending on how useful they are. It promotes new Alexa skills on your home screen, even if you haven’t asked for them. It’s not exactly an advertising service, Amazon Alexa Skills VP Aaron Rubenson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, not something developers will have to pay for. “It’s open to everybody to raise their hand and say they want to be part of it,” he says, adding that you’ll see personalized results based on other signals you send Alexa. One of the first featured skill cards will be Comedy Central, and Rubenson says he might well see it because he already listens to some comedy in his Alexa Flash Briefing each morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HRWZ4"&gt;But even if you don’t have an Echo device with a screen, you may get more Alexa skills suggested to you soon. Amazon says it’s expanding its &lt;strong&gt;name-free interaction toolkit&lt;/strong&gt; to let skills volunteer to be promoted when you speak phrases like “Alexa, how did the Nasdaq do today?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC1ejr"&gt;“We’re letting developers raise their hand and say, ‘My skill can handle that request,’” says Rubenson. And you agree to use Amazon’s suggested skills, Alexa can pass along your request instead of making you repeat yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u0CTe7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Here’s Alexa with the upsell&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OoyLQe"&gt;While Amazon was the only one that previously profited from physical merchandise sold through Alexa, the company will now let Alexa skill developers sell products inside their skills as well with &lt;strong&gt;Alexa shopping actions&lt;/strong&gt; and get up to a 10 percent affiliate marketing commission from Amazon, too. As expected, you can only sell products listed on Amazon.com, though they don’t need to be &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;products. (Rubenson couldn’t say whether Amazon would allow skills that are effectively just stores.) Amazon’s also introducing &lt;strong&gt;paid skills&lt;/strong&gt;, so don’t be surprised if you have to pay before using your next Alexa app instead of using an in-app purchase afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wd7wiV"&gt;While Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429893/amazon-voice-interoperability-initiative-alexa-apple-google-samsung"&gt;still doesn’t&lt;/a&gt; seem to have attracted rivals Apple, Google, and Samsung to its voice interoperability initiative yet, it does have some news on that front as well. Rubenson says Samsung will have a fridge with both Bixby and Alexa “operating side by side,” and the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant&lt;/a&gt; (which lets brands create their own Alexa-powered assistant) will appear in a Verizon smart display where Alexa can handle standard Alexa tasks while the new Verizon assistant can handle requests like checking your wireless bill. Rubenson says they can hand off requests to each other, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyItDb"&gt;In addition to those highlights, here’s a quick bulleted list of other Alexa updates that caught my eye:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="Cndhyo"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Food Skill APIs&lt;/strong&gt; for “high-quality, food delivery and pickup experiences.” Domino’s Pizza will use it at some point; here’s an example:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HIIL-sZQWvFpFJM8tcRPCVkT2CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22731013/dominos.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eGpyId"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Send to Phone &lt;/strong&gt;where “customers can start an experience on their Alexa-enabled device, and continue it on their mobile phone.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;McDonald’s UK, Twitter, Husqvarna, Iberia Airlines, Cookpad, and Lysol will connect their mobile apps with Alexa skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V8vlG2"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Event-Based Triggers and Proactive Suggestions: &lt;/strong&gt;“For example, if a customer is heading out for work, customers could opt in to have a skill proactively suggest that they lock their home.” Whole Foods will launch a “curbside pickup experience” later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="T9hBJt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Later this year, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WholeFoods?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WholeFoods&lt;/a&gt; will launch a proactive curbside pickup experience using event-based triggers and proactive suggestions. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AlexaLive?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AlexaLive&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AHSBXhOIvS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AHSBXhOIvS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alexa Developers (@alexadevs) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexadevs/status/1417881122436960256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ieiJeO"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Find My&lt;/strong&gt; is opening up the “Alexa, Find my” command to more companies with Tile-like device trackers, with Samsung and Remote+ arriving later this year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DXu8MJ"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexa Device Discovery&lt;/strong&gt; will be able to discover new categories of devices like printers and smart TVs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w62W6S"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Alexa Entities&lt;/strong&gt; now lets any skill developer access Alexa’s knowledge graph for general answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="ulXl4r"&gt;That’s not the whole list, mind you: there’s even more in Amazon’s full blog post, which we’ll add to this story once it’s live. In addition, Amazon is announcing today that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350418"&gt;almost every Echo smart speaker will support Matter&lt;/a&gt;, a new ambitious open standard for smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbKUM0"&gt;The new features are all coming as part of the company’s Alexa Live developer conference today, where it’s seeking to attract the next generation of programmers to build skills for its voice assistant. Amazon says it now has 900,000 registered developers and 130,000 skills (&lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2020/07/enter-the-alexa-skills-challenge-alexa-conversations-to-compete-for-over-100-000-in-prizes"&gt;up from 750,000 developers&lt;/a&gt; a year ago and &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/2019/09/congratulations-alexa-skill-builders-100-000-skills-and-counting"&gt;100,000 skills&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019), and Rubenson tells us developer revenue has doubled annually, with some skill developers  making over $1 million a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jge0Q1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwSKiw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon promises most Echo speakers will get upgraded to Matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkrgAO4AVmcTN-XMsprK1FImHAY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612111/dseifert_201020_4247_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TU44j8"&gt;Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, and dozens of other firms have agreed to try to make setting up smart homes easier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;with Matter&lt;/a&gt;, a cross-platform open-source standard coming later this year. Now, Amazon has revealed the scope of its initial commitment: it will be upgrading almost every plug-in Echo smart speaker to support Matter, including most Echo and Echo Dot speakers and every Echo Studio, Echo Show, Echo Plus, and Echo Flex. &lt;br&gt;In fact, the only Echo smart speakers that won’t get upgraded to Matter are the first-gen Echo, first-gen Echo Dot and Echo Tap, a rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMi5bn"&gt;While the company doesn’t provide a timeline for those upgrades, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387252/project-chip-will-finally-ship-later-this-year"&gt;the general idea is that Matter will launch by late 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so it shouldn’t be long until Amazon’s newest and / or more popular devices receive the capability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZ33I9"&gt;A bigger question is whether any of them will work as Matter hubs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193059/eero-pro-6-review-mesh-router-wifi-6-test-speeds-network"&gt;Google announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that in addition to upgrading its Nest devices to Matter, it would allow its devices that support the Thread protocol (like the Nest Wi-Fi, Nest Hub Max, and second-gen Nest Hub) to double as connection hubs for Matter, too, not simply as a voice assistant to control Matter gadgets. But while Amazon’s Eero routers were early to adopt Thread, Amazon’s Echo smart speakers were not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4WF0n"&gt;The announcement comes as part of Amazon’s Alexa Live developer event today, where it’s revealing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22350074"&gt;quite a few additional things that Alexa devs will soon be able to do&lt;/a&gt;. The company has a message for Matter developers: “We will soon be rolling out tools that make it easy for you to build Matter certified devices, and are ready to start testing your Matter devices now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHqmr8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram can now automatically translate text in stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cowE-gK2yqAGL61897lqaM_6SWQ=/2x0:1535x1022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69612103/Press__2_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When a foreign language is detected, an option to ‘See Translation’ now appears.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZJw1zO"&gt;Instagram is adding a new option to automatically translate text in story posts, the company announced today. Now, when the service detects a foreign language in a post, it will display a “See Translation” option on the top left of the screen, which users can tap to see a translation at the bottom. Instagram says the new translation feature will be available globally, and currently supports over 90 languages to make sharing content with an international audience easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YD3OkQ"&gt;The feature, whose development was previously reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1407835245781585926"&gt;app researcher Alessandro Paluzzi&lt;/a&gt;, means there’s now parity between Instagram stories and traditional posts. In 2016, Instagram added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/23/12011008/instagram-text-translation-comments-in-app"&gt;automatic translations to comments, captions, and user bios&lt;/a&gt; but failed to include the feature with stories &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/2/12348354/instagram-stories-announced-snapchat-kevin-systrom-interview"&gt;which launched a month later&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fe5KF"&gt;Although the new feature can translate text, Instagram says audio translation isn’t available “at this time.” Although given Instagram rolled out automatic captioning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417837/instagram-captions-sticker-stories-accessibility"&gt;for English stories in May&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t seem outside of the realms of possibility that it might one day be able to translate audio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Masters of the Universe erases the past to chart a new future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HabPKxMLWg-ct_Als1Nb4srET_w=/282x0:3318x2024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611738/MastersoftheUniverse_Revelation_Part1_Episode5_00_19_39_05.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Atxnj3"&gt;Part of what made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18097423/she-ra-netflix-interview-reboot-noelle-stevenson-showrunner-nimona-lumberjanes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;so good was the way it completely reimagined the classic cartoon. It was still set in a magical realm with talking horses and evil robot armies, but it took an old show — which, if we’re being honest, was created for the express purpose of selling toys — and gave its characters and world some real depth and meaning. It was funny and exciting, heartbreaking and beautiful, without a toy commercial in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu7p0e"&gt;On the surface, &lt;em&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/em&gt;, which stars She-Ra’s long-lost twin brother He-Man, isn’t quite so exciting. It’s not a reboot but a direct sequel, one that’s meant to pick up right after the original cartoon ended in 1985. It has the same cast of characters, some of which are pretty goofy, like a wimpy battle cat and an alien sorcerer with self-esteem problems. Skeletor (now played by Mark Hamill) remains a gigantic dork. Yet, thanks to a bold decision early on, the show manages to become something that almost feels new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hln5Bw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3njnr"&gt;Because it’s a direct sequel, &lt;em&gt;Revelation&lt;/em&gt; wastes no time in setting things up. Immediately Skeletor is in the midst of a plan to destroy Castle Grayskull in order to reveal its true power so that he can harness it for himself. Unfortunately, his attack has the potential side effect of not only destroying the planet of Eternia, but also all of existence. The ensuing battle between the two iconic leads largely removes them from the story, and shifts the focus to other characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Js1lTH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iXdEeRBh9Zk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvCjtP"&gt;It’s a dramatic shift, and from there &lt;em&gt;Revelation&lt;/em&gt; resembles something of a post-apocalyptic fantasy wasteland. The story fast-forwards a few years when Teela (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a former royal guard, is now a scavenger, making a living by scrounging for old bits of tech and items imbued with magic. There’s a strange cult that worships technology, and, without Skeletor to lead them, Eternia’s many villains have scattered. Eventually, Teela learns that the planet is slowly dying as its magic leaks away, so she reluctantly sets about setting things right. It’s one of those epic quests that involves traveling to both heaven and hell, and pulling together a group of misfits to help you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IzWE3"&gt;This premise lets the show mostly get away from the Saturday morning cartoon vibe of the original, while still keeping the same characters and world. Eternia remains an interesting mix of sci-fi, swords, and sorcery, as if Frank Frazetta and Ralph McQuarrie had a jam session. Killer robots fight alongside beast men, and sword-wielding warriors ride mechanical horses and armored cats into battle. Things have a bit more of a &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt; vibe this time around, with villages fighting over the last drops of magic while the techno-cult terrorizes them. In addition, Teela has a new job as a mercenary, Man-at-Arms (Liam Cunningham) has become an Obi-Wan-style hermit, and Evil-Lyn (Lena Headey) is left confused without a dictator to support. They all end up joining forces in the quest.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DQaDgFV6v9PQYlFVR7TLfTtNbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728252/MastersoftheUniverse_Revelation_Part1_Episode3_00_01_36_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DGot4P"&gt;It can feel like a reboot, but the show does retain some of the inherent silliness of its predecessor. &lt;em&gt;Revelation&lt;/em&gt;’s writers never met a terrible pun they didn’t like, and characters like the dopey villain Mer-Man and the perpetually terrified Cringer feel out of place in this grittier world. The acting is also uneven. There are some good individual performances — Cunningham adds a welcome gravitas, Headey channels her inner Cersei, and Hamill hams it up as always — but it often sounds like a video game where everyone recorded their lines separately. (There are also a few bizarre jokes, like a “no glove, no love” quip that doesn’t seem appropriate in a PG cartoon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taXQ2s"&gt;Because of all of these elements, the show doesn’t feel quite as refreshing or daring as &lt;em&gt;She-Ra&lt;/em&gt;. But for a direct sequel to the original cartoon made to sell toys, its surprisingly modern; the dramatic opening paves the way for a new path even if &lt;em&gt;Revelation&lt;/em&gt; never fully breaks away from its source. What’s available now on Netflix is also only a beginning: the first part of &lt;em&gt;Revelation&lt;/em&gt; is five episodes long, and the final episode suggests there might be even bigger changes in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXYN4U"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Masters of the Universe: Revelations &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be on Netflix on July 23rd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfKClI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 21st, 12:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This review has been updated to remove a specific plot spoiler. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gives Pixel 4 XL an extra year of free repairs for power issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-adPzqMK7Q5i3AAb7EwEi3NHccw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611569/vpavic_191016_3730_0029.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verg&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ENwDJK"&gt;If your out-of-warranty Pixel 4 XL has been exhibiting some problems, you might be able to get a free repair. Google recently &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10169830?hl=en"&gt;posted a support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining a “one-year extended repair program” for the larger of its two 2019 flagships. Those who are eligible can receive a free repair for up to a year after their original warranty expires. As for who’s covered by this program, Google points to “certain power-related issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuqPLc"&gt;More specifically, the company says these are the problems that “may” get a free repair:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wAVXaX"&gt;A Pixel 4 XL that can’t be powered on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NPYIhX"&gt;The Pixel 4 XL restarts or shuts down randomly without any user action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rGk1L3"&gt;Charging problems with the power adapter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="smPuWr"&gt;Wireless charging issues&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7lmSNv"&gt;The battery on a Pixel 4 XL is draining “significantly faster than earlier in its use”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="TM5eKI"&gt;That’s a pretty wide spread of potential ways to qualify for the repair program. But Google cautions that if there are other major problems with your phone (like a damaged screen) that “prevent” the complimentary repair, those will have to be fixed first — and for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpK70V"&gt;Pixel 4 XL owners can bring their device to &lt;a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/locations"&gt;a uBreakiFix store&lt;/a&gt; to see if it qualifies for a free fix. According to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/20/google-might-be-extending-your-pixel-4-xls-warranty-for-an-extra-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, repair staff at those locations are very familiar with the situation. You can also start the repair process directly with Google to see if your issue is covered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFv7Xm"&gt;The extended repair program is available in the US, Canada, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan. Google specifies that it does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; apply in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain, or the UK. That’s because Pixel 4 XLs purchased in those countries already came with a longer two-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adam Neumann’s WeWork debacle wasn’t possible without VC help</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="WeWork Presents Second Annual Creator Global Finals At Microsoft Theater" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dsUpSAV4BHCajnXPnwzM4ksJh2w=/0x0:5406x3604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611557/1079941752.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new book explains how the failed IPO truly took a village&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Sk2BUd"&gt;For the better part of two years now, I’ve been wondering how the 2019 WeWork debacle happened. Whatever, sure, Adam Neumann is a &lt;em&gt;wild and crazy guy&lt;/em&gt; — but without commitments from a number of sophisticated investors (Benchmark! T Rowe Price! Fidelity! Harvard University!), his tequila-soaked dreams never would have become a reality. I’ve been waiting for &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; to explain what these people were doing, handing Neumann all that cash, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cult-We-Neumann-Startup-Delusion-ebook/dp/B08FHC77MT/ref=sr_1_1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cult of We&lt;/em&gt; by Eliot Brown and Maureen Farrell&lt;/a&gt; finally gets there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="izrNRr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adam had a meeting with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, where he told Musk that getting people to Mars would be the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; part&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2XOPTa"&gt;Take the fateful S-1, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;document required for its IPO&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882491/wework-adam-neumann-softbank-ceo"&gt;I wondered&lt;/a&gt; how so many people had read the document and decided it was fine. Helpfully, Brown and Farrell explain this: turns out bidding for the IPO was very intense between Goldman and JP Morgan. And all those weird provisions? Well, JP Morgan pointed out that the public might not like them! Mary Callahan Erdoes, the CEO of JP Morgan’s wealth management division, was dispatched to tell Adam that all the provisions in the S-1 that benefited him were likely to cause a major hit to WeWork’s valuation. He shrugged. And that was that — WeWork was the client and JP Morgan was getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbcUEj"&gt;I don’t mean to suggest the book is short on details about the Neumanns, who seem delusional. Rebekah Paltrow Neumann, for instance, saw six different iterations of her office, which featured a pink and yellow couch and a white sheepskin rug — but nonetheless complained when it was finished because it was smaller than Adam’s. (“My soul can’t breathe,” she said.) And Adam had a meeting with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, where he told Musk that getting people to Mars would be the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt; part; building community would be hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrLUWd"&gt;But, the book explains, WeWork was a functional business in 2012, when it made a profit. That was, incidentally, before it retooled itself to be appealing to venture capitalists. After reading Brown and Farrell’s reporting, it seems to me that after 2012, WeWork’s primary function wasn’t office space — it was raising its valuation. And the sky-high valuation wasn’t on the Neumanns alone; it was also on everyone who gave Adam money, but especially Masayoshi Son, who encouraged him to think &lt;em&gt;even bigger&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8CtFK"&gt;Another thing working in Adam Neumann’s favor was the tech industry’s cult of the founder, which had become part of the venture capital pitch; the phrase “founder friendly” appears in the book’s index. Founders were to be worshipped, adherents of this sect believed, and should have full, unfettered control over their companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dnxfk1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How did they all get played?” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y66An"&gt;Brown, who began covering WeWork as a real estate reporter at &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, watched in surprise as the WeWork brand took off as a “tech company.” Farrell, whose specialty at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;is IPOs, was writing madly as the IPO began to unravel. The two realized they had a book on their hands pretty quickly — “WeWork was the apotheosis of like, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; concerning trend,” Brown says — and they wanted to know how the whole debacle had happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSdTOj"&gt;I talked with Brown and Farrell about their book, the venture capital industry, and the spineless cast of characters — the board of directors, for instance, who simply thought it would be easier to let Adam Neumann have his way. “It still is kind of wild to me how Adam Neumann had the ultimate power to make all of this happen and do all the things he did when you have some of the most sophisticated financiers in the world behind him,” Ferrell tells me. “How did they all get played?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6R0m6X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EB7aLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of the things that freaked people out in the S-1 had actually been reported earlier, by you and others. So why didn’t someone press pause sooner?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBNEV7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eliot Brown:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t know! We would write stories and then the valuation kept going up. We’d write stories on conflicts of interest and, you know, people would sort of just glide past that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GMidBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was grand delusion internally.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A0oL83"&gt;There were a couple things going on. People started coming to the reality in mid-2019 [after the IPOs of money-losing ride-share companies Uber and Lyft], that like, wow, companies that lose billions of dollars — that might not be a cool business model long term. There was this talk of “Oh, now companies need to show a path to profitability.” A path to profitability? That’s what a company is! Like, of course they show that! That’s the point! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8tyDj"&gt;And then the S-1 itself was just... It had so many things that were totally insane that it would have been just impossible to ignore all this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcATE8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maureen Farrell:&lt;/strong&gt; It was grand delusion internally. Adam ran the company in the most chaotic way. And it worked up until a point. But I mean, when you’re just getting into the weeds on what was happening day to day, with the S-1 ramp up, it was just — everything was so crazy. People are living in this world of chaos, and so certain things didn’t become clear, like the $5.9 million payment for the word “We,” they kind of missed that. Because there’s so many other insane things in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKARYS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But WeWork didn’t start as something crazy. In fact, renting people office space is not a terrible idea. Is there a specific point when things changed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnkrhD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; Maybe broadly what WeWork shows is that not every business is a venture capital business. There’s this meme in Silicon Valley, and entrepreneurship today, that if you have an ice cream company, it’s not gonna be a good ice cream company unless you raise VC money. And so everything has to be tech and everything has to be, you know, rapid growth. And it turns out that some businesses do not need to do that and are not built for that. So I think the turning point is when WeWork first took venture capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jINwD1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Adam Neumann was fixated on making the company as big as it could possibly be.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hW4KsB"&gt;They literally were profitable for one year in their history. And that was 2012, by their own numbers. After that, it was just nothing but losses, right? They originally hit this gold mine, where real estate was cheap and demand for this kind of cool, hipster-y, millennial chic space was high, and so they could make enough money. And so then a normal, rational human might say, “Okay, well, let’s just grow kind of at whatever pace that allows and not try to take over the planet in the next five years.” But that wasn’t the sort of venture capital mindset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZAaqf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did venture capital get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNZZYh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; Adam Neumann was fixated on making the company as big as it could possibly be and, you know, getting the valuation high as it could possibly be. So he kind of morphed the company into... like the venture capitals were almost his clients, you know? He focused the business and sort of changed it and explained it in such a way that it would appeal to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6DNGm"&gt;It was a leap of faith, believing that the business model was something it wasn’t. It didn’t make sense. It was a real estate company. And he convinced some of the most sophisticated and successful venture capitalists in the world that it was something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="q6pSsd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Maybe this mattress company &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tech company!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2lp6bA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s just a product of simply there being too much money, right? There’s only so many good ideas out there. Money could go into other things, but everyone was trying to get into Silicon Valley. So there’s this waterfall going into a small spigot because it really can’t absorb that much money. And so in bubbles, that’s what happens — people cast aside critical thinking. Instead, they’re like, “Maybe this mattress company &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tech company!” Because if you don’t say that, then you can’t spend your money. And if you don’t spend money, you can’t make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNwfGP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much did the Silicon Valley focus on the founder play into this mindset?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBJvBA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; The whole cult of the founder was so central to this narrative in general and how this all played out. It really gave Adam Neumann this really long leash, because founders are geniuses and they are eccentric. So who’s the next Mark Zuckerberg that can create this Goliath of a company and make us gigantic returns?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgWySu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throughout the book, I kept wondering, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is going on with this board?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Over and over again, they rubber-stamp Neumann’s decisions. In fact, there’s this excuse that shows up over and over: Oh, the public markets will create discipline. Why is that the public markets’ job?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="IEZad7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Toward the end, he just stopped going to board meetings. He just didn’t show up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0qBpC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; In the book, we spell that out, that the directors are saying that to each other, which is just so crazy. They handed him super voting control, they let him get that. And then it seemed like they absolved themselves of having any clear role in pushing back on him, when that’s the role they’re supposed to take. That floored us so much each step of the way. And the board&lt;em&gt; finally&lt;/em&gt; stepped up and flipped out at him just as the IPO is about to completely blow up. That was the first time you see them really pushing back in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2lhF1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; Toward the end, he just stopped going to board meetings. He just didn’t show up. They finally just flip out, and say, “Adam, you have to come to these things.” One of the directors goes up to meet him in his office like, “Adam, it’s a board meeting.” That’s September 2019, which is when it was falling apart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bomiY"&gt;The other thing with the board is, we asked people, “Why wouldn’t you stand up?” And the answer was, “Well, he controls the board. So what’s the point of voting no? Because he’ll just be mad and he’s gonna win anyhow.” Okay, but if a majority of you voted no, then he would have to actually blow up the board — that’s a really big action. But they would never vote no, it was unanimous. It’s like “You want this jet?” Everyone would be like, “No, I don’t want the jet.” And then, you look at the minutes — oh, unanimously approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3K9WyM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The easy answer was, ‘Well, my job as a board director is to have the share price go up.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eFos62"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; You know, the easy answer was, “Well, my job as a board director is to have the share price go up.” The share price kept going up and up and up, and they were getting extremely wealthy. They were killing it on their investments. So from that perspective, it was working. It would be easier to argue with Adam if the company were declining in value. So then the first time that they stand up to him is when the company is running out of money and, you know, its valuation has plunged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1hUE8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the same thing had happened now — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;after GameStonk stuff in January&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — would there have been the same kind of rebellion on the part of the public markets? Or would people have been like, yeah, sure, we’ve got a bunch of weird shit out here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yK1Phg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things we saw on Palantir, even, there are some very extreme steps that the founders had taken — they could have no economic stake in the company and keep voting control. So there’s been a lot of crazy stuff that’s come out into the public markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ExrOP"&gt;Someone I talked to right after the S-1 came out said there’s a menu of things that founders can pick from to kind of push the envelope. And in that menu, maybe people pick a few of them. Adam Neumann picked every single one on that menu, and it was just so egregious. Even in this market, it was a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fcCg8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; The super loss-heavy startups, where you can have, literally, one, two, three, four billion-dollar losses in a year — that has fallen a bit out of vogue. Who knows if it comes back! Most of the super-highly-valued unicorns going public are slightly better in terms of, you know, not hemorrhaging cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iqo4tB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did we learn any lessons from WeWork?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="od2xZC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zK46xI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“WeWork and Adam Neumann were the manifestation of the financial system that was structured this way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="acb5yd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; For a minute, it really seemed like they did. In 2019, for a while, Masayoshi Son was telling everyone, “Oh, you suddenly have to be profitable.” And then the pendulum has swung back faster than we ever could have anticipated. And it almost feels more extreme in some ways than it was then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvPFu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; When we started the book, we thought it was the punctuation of an era of, you know, Silicon Valley unicorn insanity. And then the pandemic happened, and the Fed printed money and cash rolled even more into Silicon Valley. And, yeah, it seems to have gone the other way. So WeWork was more of a blip than the end of an era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApUtYZ"&gt;These things go in cycles. If you were to be a super charismatic founder out there trying to raise money for a co-working company right now at a $47 billion valuation, it would be extremely difficult. People still do mention WeWork in VC circles. But one of the things that the pendulum has swung so the public markets are kind of where the crazy is right now. So this is a long way of saying we have learned nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OGqb0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MF:&lt;/strong&gt; We hope people take some lessons from the book. Maybe there are lessons to be learned or — even just a wake-up call. The reckoning that seemed to happen immediately, we hope can happen again, when you just put every piece of the story out there. What does it mean to be a director? What does it mean to be a banker to these companies? Should you stand up to someone like him?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CHvnlj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EB:&lt;/strong&gt; One of the things we really feel strongly about is this isn’t a story about Adam Neumann and WeWork being special. WeWork and Adam Neumann were the manifestation of the financial system that was structured this way. And if it wasn’t Adam Neumann, who, you know, bought a plane and a jet wave pool company and started an elementary school with his VC money, it would have been someone else doing something maybe slightly less crazy. But this is what happens when you have these forces where there’s just so much money in Silicon Valley, there’s this meme that founders are immortal beings and special, and we should give them control. Like, this is the obvious manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tumblr starts letting bloggers charge a subscription</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshots show Tumblr on an iPhone. There’s a “Support” button at the top of the blog, which leads to a pop-up explaining the subscription price and perks." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V4J893tXJJOZ-wctGzubhE7f23Q=/625x0:7377x4501/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611270/01_Artistv2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tumblr’s Post Plus feature lets blogs offer a subscription for exclusive posts. | Image: Tumblr&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C2Qbgq"&gt;Tumblr is finally offering its writers a way to make money off their work: charging a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cNVk0"&gt;The 14-year-old blogging platform is starting to add the ability for writers to put their posts behind a paywall. The feature, called Post Plus, lets creators offer a $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month subscription, which will give readers access to any posts they decide to designate as for subscribers only. For now, the feature is available in a “limited beta” for select creators only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7F4z9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like Substack, without the whole email thing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Icb1tL"&gt;The formula sounds a lot like what Substack offers — a blog and an easy way for writers to charge for it — minus the whole emailed newsletter component. Facebook is also starting to test the waters in this area and is starting a subscription newsletter product called Bulletin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMtybV"&gt;While Tumblr is still a big network, the platform has been shrinking. It now gets 11.3 million daily posts, according to Tumblr’s press information page, down from 14.8 million this time last year, and 67.7 million this time in 2012, according to archives of the page. Tumblr struggled during the shift to mobile, and it later stalled after being purchased by Yahoo in 2013 and Verizon in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmrj9X"&gt;Automattic, which runs WordPress.com, bought Tumblr in 2019, but it hasn’t done much with the service since. It’s hard to imagine a paywall feature, for a site that is often used for pseudonymous fan blogging, will be what brings people back. But it’s a step toward making the platform a more flexible option for writers and gives existing ones another reason to stick around. The network is now highlighting its continued adoption by younger users, saying that just about half of its users are part of Gen Z.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mn7HFN"&gt;A wide launch of the feature is planned for this fall, a Tumblr spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Tumblr will take a 5 percent fee from subscriptions, which is competitive compared to Substack’s 10 percent cut. If readers subscribe on iOS or Android, though, those platforms’ 30 percent app store fees will come out of what a creator gets to keep.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your name on TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFTBC6u3D8EwYbS5JeVsEkDl8Jc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69611264/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lxcf8x"&gt;When you start using TikTok, you’re asked for a profile name and a username. If you’ve been using TikTok for a while, though, it wouldn’t be unusual to decide that you want to change one or both. Perhaps you used your real name and weren’t aware at first that your name would be made public. Or perhaps the name you originally chose is no longer quite right for the type of content you’re going to post. Or perhaps you simply decided that you want to be known by something more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDGE5j"&gt;Either way, it’s simple to change either your profile name or your username. (In TikTok, the username is the one preceded by an @ sign.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9ILSk"&gt;Go to your profile page (by tapping the “Me” icon in the lower-right corner).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4olhQg"&gt;Select “Edit profile.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MrK9QW"&gt;Select “Name” (to change your profile name) or “Username.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GX3Aah"&gt;Type in your new name. (In the case of your username, remember that will have to be unique.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can change names on the “Edit profile” page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAQYtGOeyYC9trgBkt8ec1OhuZI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730561/Screenshot_20210720_162536.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can change names on the “Edit profile” page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can only change your username once every 30 days." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lpekqag83vmDpvKMRRsDEQ2SOxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22730562/Screenshot_20210720_162749.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can only change your username once every 30 days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Epixf"&gt;There are several other things you need to be aware of before you change your username. First, your username can only be changed once every 30 days, so make sure it’s one you can live with, at least for that period. In addition, if you change your username, that means you’ll be also changing your personal TikTok URL (which is usually in the form of something like &lt;em&gt;tiktok.com/@username&lt;/em&gt;). As a result, anyone who tries to use the older address will no longer see your videos. &lt;/p&gt;
