    <title>Parler’s CEO has been fired</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vxuKfD"&gt;After his social media platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;was largely wiped off the web&lt;/a&gt;, Parler CEO and co-founder John Matze says he has been fired by his company’s own board of directors, according to &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/parler-ceo-john-matze-says-hes-been-terminated-by-board-i-did-not-participate-in-this-decision"&gt;a memo obtained by Fox News&lt;/a&gt; and a text message confirmation &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2K95IO"&gt;he sent to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2As8L"&gt;Parler, of course, is the social network that found itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;wholly deplatformed&lt;/a&gt; after its role in the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Both Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; removed the app from their app stores after being unsatisfied with the company’s attempts to moderate the spread of calls for violence. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon decided&lt;/a&gt; to terminate the company’s AWS website hosting completely. And though Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;did try to sue Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22231457/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-judge-preliminary-injunction-denied"&gt;denied a demand&lt;/a&gt; for its website hosting to be reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIwp1a"&gt;On January 10th, Matze told Fox News that all the company’s vendors — and even its lawyers — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;had abandoned him.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZyYgKS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are the violent threats that made Amazon drop Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"},{"title":"Why platforms had to cut off Trump and Parler","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EUsa7Z"&gt;Today, Matze claims he was terminated by a board led by Rebekah Mercer (of the Mercer family, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565344/parler-funding-conservative-mercer-app-trump-twitter-facebook"&gt;who are prominent conservative donors&lt;/a&gt;), and that he had “met constant resistance to my product vision,” according to his memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sp0M7X"&gt;It might also have something to do with the company getting run into the ground under his watch. In addition to the difficulties of simply staying up on the internet, it came to light that Parler may have had some privacy issues. Researchers were able to scrape a tremendous amount of users’ content, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;including their geotagged locations and videos&lt;/a&gt;, which were later converted into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231749/parler-interactive-map-video-gps-capitol-attack"&gt;interactive maps of the Capitol building attack&lt;/a&gt; that proved many Parler users were involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZPwVp"&gt;The House Oversight Committee even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called for an FBI investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Parler’s involvement in the attack on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyCPib"&gt;Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;does currently have a website again&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the hosting services of Epik, a company that also supports controversial websites like Gab and 8chan, and Parler suggested on January 17th that it hoped “to welcome all of you back soon.” But that was over two weeks ago, and the website is mostly a timeline of grievances about how the company has been treated unjustly. Matze hasn’t posted there since Monday, January 26th. His last post was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;a Bernie Sanders meme&lt;/a&gt; with the text “I wish that John guy would hurry up already.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGyybz_Qxr8KZP9LAd0sFAq5IFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279936/matze_last_post_parler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iub5X2"&gt;Apparently, Rebekah Mercer agreed with that sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUACSk"&gt;Parler didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4a76I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon plans to install always-on surveillance cameras in its delivery vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Amazon Prime delivery van is seen in London..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcfLhnq9JOAjelSzFpIBLfAFLUY=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765487/1229783847.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhKWYf"&gt;Amazon plans to install high-tech video cameras in its delivery vehicles in order to better monitor the behavior of drivers as they deliver packages, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-plans-ai-powered-cameras-to-monitor-delivery-van-drivers"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMq0Fc"&gt;The hardware and software will be supplied by Netradyne, a California company behind a platform called &lt;a href="https://www.netradyne.com/driveri/"&gt;Driveri&lt;/a&gt; that uses cameras and artificial intelligence to analyze a driver as they operate the vehicle. The camera then gives real-time feedback — including automated suggestions like “distracted driving” and “please slow down” — while collecting analysis that is used to later evaluate drivers during their shifts, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8MICg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Netradyne cameras record 100 percent of the time and automatically upload footage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GhOww8"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F504570835%2Fe80ee265bc&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22265031%2Famazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unlisted, week-old video hosted on the website Vimeo&lt;/a&gt; details the partnership. It’s narrated by Karolina Haraldsdottir, Amazon’s senior manager for last-mile safety, and outlines the company’s goals as reducing collisions and holding drivers more accountable for mistakes on the road. The initiative mirrors one Amazon has taken with its long-haul trucking fleet, in which SmartDrive cameras monitor freight drivers for signs of fatigue and distracted driving, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/inside-amazons-trucking-ambitions"&gt;separate report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNbHUY"&gt;The marketing video showcases how the cameras record “100% of the time” (though without audio and not viewable live) and upload footage to a dedicated safety team for review if any one of 16 signals is triggered through an incident happening on the road or an action the driver takes. The driver is able to manually disable the camera, but only when the ignition is off. Drivers are also allowed to manually upload footage when they choose to. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yv7OFtakQ7D0kMonzGrFoJPZc_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279686/amazon_netradyne_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LSxCh1"&gt;“We’re always searching out innovative ways to keep drivers safe. That’s why we have partnered with Netradyne to help make improvements to the driver experience,” Haraldsdottir says on camera. She describes Netradyne as the first company to merge AI with video “to create industry-leading safety systems, reducing collisions by a third through in-cab warnings and another third through improving driver behaviors.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zY8tMw"&gt;Haraldsdottir says Amazon wants to “set up drivers for success and provide them support for being safer on road and handling incidents if and when they happen.” But &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;talked with some drivers who are concerned that the use of Netradyne’s technology might constitute unfair and invasive surveillance and place even further burdens on them as they try to meet tight deadlines. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5GZVGF1Ak6qE_2bNnt6zN8GgCuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279685/amazon_netradyne_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i68Q0j"&gt;Amazon has historically relied on last-mile operators like the US Postal Service and UPS to get packages to customers’ doorsteps, but the company has increasingly begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;using its own growing logistics network&lt;/a&gt; of airplanes, trucks, and delivery vehicles to cut costs. For last-mile deliveries, that has included both third-party delivery companies Amazon contracts directly and a growing platform of Uber-like workers using their own vehicles under the Amazon Flex platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZoH47"&gt;As part of this network, Amazon operates a fleet of tens of thousands of delivery drivers all over the country that, as part of these third-party firms, are not technically company employees. Nonetheless, these drivers operate Amazon Prime-branded vehicles and are subject to any restrictions or monitoring the company puts in place in many ways similar to the intense control Amazon exerts over its warehouse workers. That includes minute-by-minute surveillance via mobile app of where a driver is on their programmed route and whether they’re falling behind schedule. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4R4Vkjjv2QNp6eV0S-5Bog7ennI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279672/amazon_netradyne_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Nick Statt / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4I3AVv"&gt;Those monitoring tools appear to also include new Netradyne cameras, although &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says it’s not clear when Amazon intends to install the cameras and how widespread throughout its delivery fleet they’ll be. “We are investing in safety across our operations and recently started rolling out industry leading camera-based safety technology across our delivery fleet,” an Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Information &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. “This technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcrFjL"&gt;In using its own network of both professional and civilian delivery drivers, Amazon has faced scrutiny in recent years for prioritizing speed and consumer convenience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035849/amazon-delivery-network-safety-speed-buzzfeed-propublica-report"&gt;over the safety of delivery personnel&lt;/a&gt;, while at the same time placing increasingly onerous burdens on its drivers dictating the route they take and the order in which they drop off packages to avoid delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IJ6RsL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon is stepping up its surveillance of contract workers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSv6c2"&gt;Last fall, Amazon was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418057/amazon-surveilling-flex-delivery-drivers-facebook-groups-subreddits-strikes-protests"&gt;caught surveilling contract Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; in private Facebook groups to see whether some were planning labor actions like work stoppages or strikes. In March of last year, Amazon came under fire for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21168724/amazon-flex-coronavirus-warner-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-instacart-doordash"&gt;declining to pay Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; forced to stay home due to the coronavirus, despite Uber and Lyft opting to compensate their drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kHeLF"&gt;Amazon delivery drivers have also caused dozens of accidents over the last half-decade, including some that resulted in deaths, but the company often avoids liability for the accidents due to the way it employs third-party firms and independent contractors, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html"&gt;reported &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Just earlier this week, Amazon was ordered to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262294/amazon-flex-wage-theft-allegations-ftc-fine-drivers-gig-tips"&gt;pay more than $61 million to Flex drivers&lt;/a&gt; as part of a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission over wage theft allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HqQZ7E"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Check out these new videos from Super Nintendo World in Japan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bct66zrHPuyvpKXXLaA24KYZWY=/163x29:1278x772/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765471/Screen_Shot_2021_02_03_at_5.12.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="795d5Y"&gt;Today, the fan site Universal Parks News Today &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cv_E2dSTHw4&amp;amp;list=PLy9eoiZLpVdIB_HEfawrE6qGXm935KAbO"&gt;dropped a slew of videos from inside Japan’s Super Nintendo World&lt;/a&gt; that show what the whole experience of going to the park is like. It’s a cool look at what’s sure to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189601/super-nintendo-world-theme-park-universal-studios-japan-mario-shigeru-miyamoto"&gt;a very popular post-COVID destination for Nintendo fans&lt;/a&gt;. From what I can tell, the park seems stuffed with people and attractions. It looks surprisingly normal, though everyone is wearing a mask. They went on every ride! They tried all the food! It’s guaranteed to make you want to go yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rjLvPd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQpKApIRE_0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sgxDB4"&gt;What’s a little stranger is the videos show the park stuffed with people, but it’s not supposed to be open yet. The original plan was to open the Osaka park on February 4th, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230412/super-nintendo-world-opening-date-delay-osaka-japan"&gt;but a state of emergency was declared&lt;/a&gt;. Universal Studios Japan &lt;a href="https://www.usj.co.jp/company/news/2021/0114.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that the park wouldn’t set a new opening date until the emergency declaration was lifted, and there’s no word on when that might be yet. In the meantime, you can tour the entire park through Universal Parks News Today’s videos to take the edge off while you plan your own trip. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="support watchOS 7" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-2TkUJkurmgX8ZHUE8HnJGYxv-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9693867/akrales_171113_2119_0045.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection.

    <title>Comcast is delaying its rollout of 1.2TB data caps that would have hit 12 states in March</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Comcast sign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzNoJseOeFmZ3_ym_P7v0RLx1Ws=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765466/Comcast_sign.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oQ8L2R"&gt;If you live in one of the twelve states where Comcast is planning to roll out 1.2TB data caps, we have some moderately good news: you won’t have to start monitoring your bill for extra charges until July. The ISP &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;had planned to start&lt;/a&gt; charging customers $10-and-up fees for using more than 1.2TB of data starting this March, but the rollout has been delayed (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/03/comcast-suspends-data-caps/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This gives us a few more months until the scourge of Comcast home internet data caps are truly nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSOEqb"&gt;The areas affected are in Comcast’s Northeast region: Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Vermont, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia, as well as parts of North Carolina and Ohio. If you live in one of those areas, your bill in August could have up to $100 of overage fees for your July use. That’s a lot of extra money, but at least now you have a bit more time to see if you’ll be affected and to make a plan if you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S7YU0s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Of course, Comcast is happy to sell customers an unlimited plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m58ICX"&gt;The cap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;was scheduled to roll out this March&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s being delayed after Pennsylvania’s attorney general raised objections, saying that now, when we’re struggling with the pandemic and using the internet for work and school, is “not the time to change the rules when it comes to internet data usage and increase costs.” After negotiations, Comcast has agreed to not only push back the data cap start date, but to also waive early cancellation fees for customers who don’t want to be subjected to the caps, according to &lt;a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/press-releases/at-ag-shapiros-urging-comcast-delays-new-data-thresholds/"&gt;a press release from the attorney general’s office&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkHzdZ"&gt;While Comcast customers in the region are probably happy for the delay, the ability to cancel your service with no fees is only useful if you have another ISP that will provide you service, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;which many across the US do not&lt;/a&gt;. The rest of the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"&gt;has had data caps for a while&lt;/a&gt;, and people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/23/11494510/comcast-att-wsj-data-cap-report"&gt;haven’t liked them&lt;/a&gt;. Yet they’ve rolled out anyway because the ISPs have basically no real competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="itm40i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"},{"title":"Most Comcast customers now have a 1TB home internet data cap","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13192832/comcast-xfinity-home-internet-data-caps-one-terabyte"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DdsjFY"&gt;Comcast is, however, giving its low-income customers a bit of a break. It announced that it was doubling the speeds of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261402/comcast-internet-essentials-doubling-speed-uploads"&gt;Internet Essentials plan&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, and it’s apparently not going to be imposing data caps on that plan for the rest of 2021. Comcast confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this policy was nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAV19i"&gt;The 1.2TB-plus overage fees will come to the Northeast in July, showing up on August bills. If you go over the 1.2TB limit, you’ll have to pay $10 for every additional 50GB, with the fees capped at $100. You do get one “courtesy” month, where if you go over you won't be charged extra, but after that the fees will start rolling in. Of course, if you find yourself going over often, Comcast is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fexp-unlimited-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;happy to upgrade you&lt;/a&gt; to unlimited data for only $30 a month or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Flearn%2Finternet-service%2Fdata&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as part of a $25-a-month xFi Complete bundle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comcast shows your data usage in its app or on its website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="za899U"&gt;If you live in the Northeast and are worried about your bill going up come July, Comcast &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xfinity.com%2Fsupport%2Farticles%2Fdata-usage-usage-history&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22264430%2Fcomcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a tool to check how much data you use&lt;/a&gt;. Since that usage is what they’ll be billing you for, you can see if you’re typically over 1.2TB of usage or not — and now, you’ll have a few more months to figure out what to do if you’re consistently over. It is possible you won’t be, though. Back when I had a data cap, I generally stayed under, and I’m a pretty heavy internet user who backs up a lot of photo and video to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lonFK7"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Distressing animation captures a whale’s struggle to avoid ship strikes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTg8aV"&gt;An eye-catching animation ricocheted across Twitter this week, showing the struggles of a single blue whale as it tried to avoid crowds of shipping vessels in the Corcovado Gulf. The animation accompanied a study &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-021-82220-5%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100062364%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink%23Abs1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F3%2F22265059%2Fanimation-blue-whales-ship-strikes#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; this week&lt;/a&gt; examining the overlapping paths of ships and blue whales in the waters off Chilean Patagonia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwYIg6"&gt;Whales, including the one featured in the video, were tagged and tracked for up to three months as they moved through the gulf. The tracking data was then compared against vessel traffic patterns from a Chilean database. The scientists say their results point to a need for more protective measures, including speed regulations, to prevent ships from hitting whales in the area. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mT86z5"&gt;The visualization of a little blue dot zigzagging around the congested gulf is heartbreaking on its own, but it only offers “a glimpse of the density of vessels whales are exposed to,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BedrinanaLuis/status/1357054792691052545"&gt;according to Luis Bedriñana Romano&lt;/a&gt;, one of the authors of the study. There’s only one whale and a few boats accounted for, and the scale makes it hard to precisely understand the whale’s proximity to any vessels. But even without a full picture of just how many ships are crossing the gulf at any given time, it’s not hard to imagine a whale being struck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbmkGb"&gt;Shipping and commercial fishing vessels are a consistent danger for aquatic wildlife. Collisions between whales and ships traveling at high speeds lead to serious, sometimes fatal, injuries. It’s difficult to quantify ship strikes because they often go unreported, &lt;a href="https://iwc.int/ship-strikes"&gt;according to the International Whaling Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVfIYf"&gt;Any deaths by collision are notable for the blue whale, which is still an endangered species after decades of whaling severely whittled down its population. “[The Eastern South Pacific] blue whale population recovery might be jeopardized by the loss of even a few individuals a year,” says the study. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is working on a TikTok-style vertical feed for Stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F1vWirnjRNtu2-Ki5SHDhE9BaNQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765367/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iyn7Ch"&gt;Instagram might try to emulate another element of TikTok’s design with a new vertical feed for Stories, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/03/instagram-confirms-its-working-on-a-vertical-stories-feed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Navigating with vertical swipes up and down would make stories behave more like Reels, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;the shortform video feature&lt;/a&gt; the company added to better compete with TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOCGUT"&gt;The vertical stories feed is not currently being tested, Instagram confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, but code for the change is already in development based on this screenshot developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1356574935024599040?s=20"&gt;Alessandro Paluzzi shared&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not much to go on, but it does show Instagram is at least considering the adjustment to its ever-expanding features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lrmzcs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is working on Vertical Stories  &lt;br&gt;Swipe up and down to browse stories. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LDJje8l137"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LDJje8l137&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1356574935024599040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ohfLnL"&gt;Mimicking Reels (which, in turn, was heavily “inspired” by TikTok) would unify Instagram’s various feeds in some sense. If Stories became a vertical experience, it would not only match Reels, but also the app’s original feature: scrolling the feed. IGTV would still function a bit differently, though; those videos are buried in a vertical grid in profiles but feature horizontal navigation once you start watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KW4pW"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22237648/instagram-adam-mosseri-interview-trump-ban"&gt;an interview with Instagram head Adam Mosseri&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt; podcast, he said 2020 was about “placing a bunch of bets,” while 2021 would be about “delivering on those commitments and simplifying the experience.” The company is already testing changes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263014/instagram-disabling-stories-feed-posts"&gt;to what kind of content can be added to stories&lt;/a&gt;, and changing how those stories are displayed could be the next step in that simplification process.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC reportedly probing whether fraudulent social media posts boosted GameStop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tf3O6ZqlayXL2VRPkBvvveLFjm4=/0x0:4015x2677/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68765215/gamestop_stock_sean_hollister.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NA4ZCR"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into whether misinformation posted on social media was used to boost the stocks of GameStop and AMC, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/sec-hunts-for-fraud-in-social-media-posts-that-drove-up-gamestop"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commission is also said to be reviewing trading data as part of its probe into potential market manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpOweH"&gt;This inquiry comes a week after shares in GameStop and AMC, among other companies, were sent soaring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;largely thanks to support from Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community&lt;/a&gt;. The community is ostensibly composed of small-time, amateur traders, but there’s been speculation as to whether some of the members of the community — which describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal” — may in fact have been professional investors looking to capitalize on the forum’s fervor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LthifT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KHsjBJ"&gt;The SEC declined to comment in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The commission previously said it was looking into “compliance with regulatory obligations, adequate and consistent risk disclosure, and determining if any fraudulent or manipulative behavior has occurred,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEjVoT"&gt;The SEC has a heavy load to lift. The agency is successful in prosecuting cases when deliberate fraud was involved, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/reddit-fueled-rallies-like-gamestop-s-defy-easy-crackdown-by-sec?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s not clear that anybody was misled about GameStop. It’s acceptable to say a stock is worth more than its current price, after all, and WallStreetBets’ main positive mantra is “I like the stock.” It also has a free-for-all, wild bets mentality; “loss porn” — showing off how much your investment has fallen — is a part of the culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I61bKs"&gt;There have been widespread calls for investigations into what happened to GameStop, from whether traders manipulated the market to whether Robinhood was in the wrong to cut off small traders. Last week, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) were two of the earlier lawmakers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;call for an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Robinhood’s decision to cut off trades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdzwjE"&gt;Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) on Monday said “we need an SEC investigation” in order to determine whether there were big funds playing on both sides of the stock surge. “We actually don’t know who all the players are in all this — whether there’s big money on both sides,” Warren &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/31/investing/elizabeth-warren-gamestop-sec/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfQnBwLbLIeiZEVOPMuNUumuNok=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_190723_3560_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MyfWR7"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or simply use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling through Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while a niche piece of tech, is designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with no other functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon has dominated the space for years with its Kindle products. Right now, there are three Kindle models you can choose from, each with pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRHBaM"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current Kindles available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one or, in some instances, all of the products. In that case, we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price so you know when is a good time to buy the e-reader at a discounted rate. But most of the time, there’s some deal going on. Whether you’re looking for a new model or to grab a bundle that includes a few extras, these are the best Kindle deals right now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle (10th Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mXAcFi"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, usually costing $90. Released in 2019, this base Kindle model includes a front light, comes in one storage configuration of 8GB, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, this model has a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=66cdb661cb77c1e81f079aef980a8e89&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a tenth-gen Kindle with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $65. If you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1ccac7c6dd4bb605e9b24952e83a00de&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads&lt;/a&gt;, you can grab it for $85. Amazon is currently running a promotion with both models, where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/18/5915039/amazons-all-you-can-read-kindle-unlimited-is-now-official-at-9-99-per"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=245b190dc0183c0524d2fca4e15ce6fe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which is $95 ($40 off its usual price), and it includes a printed cover and a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019, Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $109 ($20 more than the base Kindle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon’s FreeTime Unlimited service. The latter is the biggest selling point of this device, as it allows parents to grant access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7AYlh"&gt;Right now, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Essentials-including-Protector-Adapter/dp/B07XW24MVK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition Essentials Bundle, which is $98&lt;/a&gt; and includes all of the things previously mentioned above, plus a power adapter. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (fourth-generation).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (Fourth Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="P1C5xu"&gt;Amazon released the fourth-generation Kindle Paperwhite in 2018. Starting at $130, the Paperwhite comes in three different configurations: 8GB Wi-Fi, 32GB Wi-Fi, and a second 32GB model that drops the ads from the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qneu65"&gt;The Paperwhite features a six-inch, pin-sharp backlit display, which is the main reason to get one over the base Kindle. The 2018 model added a few useful features normally found on Amazon’s flagship reader, the Oasis, such as water resistance and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;You can grab an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=42ffed2d4e93ea741088b3993a892bd2&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support&lt;/a&gt; for $95 or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a50ac8c6b048f8863946e11e500b7ce9&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$115 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a50ac8c6b048f8863946e11e500b7ce9&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Paperwhite with ads for $120&lt;/a&gt;; if you want an ad-free model, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PT96B3T?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a5f63e316ffbf676d2d0d566fd4d8603&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this configuration for $140&lt;/a&gt;. Just like the base Kindle, Amazon currently running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader plus three months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/18/5915039/amazons-all-you-can-read-kindle-unlimited-is-now-official-at-9-99-per"&gt;Kindle Unlimited&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;Amazon also discounted its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader bundle for $135&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 if you buy the 32GB&lt;/a&gt; (with ads).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kindle Oasis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Oasis (Third Generation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations: 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get the product with or without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The Kindle Oasis 2019 model looks very similar to its previous model. It still maintains its waterproof, seven-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks by connecting to Bluetooth. Yet, the biggest change to the Kindle Oasis 2019 is that it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the Kindle Oasis go down to as low as $200 if you get the 32GB model, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are no deals on just the Oasis itself, Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal price. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087YZGRGQ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1d3266e13941e5c5ecd1a595395d53d3&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087Z7Z3DF?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5647132664a6bf86fbf952131efbf7c2&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB&lt;/a&gt;, and it will also include a leather cover, a power adapter, plus three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;

Moser has returned with another cheeky spin on the iconic Apple Watch design with the &lt;a href="https://www.h-moser.com/product/swiss-alp-watch-5324-1205/"&gt;Swiss Alp Watch Final Upgrade&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a $30,800 Vantablack-infused creation that mocks not just Apple’s design but the loading wheel found on Apple’s macOS, iOS, and watchOS products, &lt;a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/h-moser-swiss-alp-vantablack-watch-hands-on"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Hodinkee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sf9as6"&gt;“No updates required, no lousy autonomy, no unnecessary features, no annoying notifications, just the only reminder you ever really need: To disconnect from all the noise and cherish each and every moment,” Moser boasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGBpe9"&gt;Moser has been making its Alp Watch series of Apple Watch-esque timepieces for years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10728220/swiss-alp-watch-anti-apple-watch"&gt;going back to the original model&lt;/a&gt; (which launched a few months after Apple’s original smartwatch). The company is known for its edgy design choices in the watchmaking world: at one point, it created a watch &lt;a href="https://www.hodinkee.com/articles/h-moser-swiss-mad-watch-swiss-cheese-limited-edition-venturer-introducing"&gt;made of actual Swiss cheese&lt;/a&gt; in protest of watchmaking standards, for instance. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2GzUqR"&gt;Since 2016, Moser has released several variants on its Alp Watch in a variety of colors and materials. But the Swiss Alp Watch Final Upgrade model (as the name implies) is apparently the final time the company will be poking fun at the folks in Cupertino. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdAcnR"&gt;The Final Upgrade model might be the most entertaining of all the pastiches, though, with a Vantablack face (which absorbs 99.965 percent of visible light) that promises to be an even darker black than even the “true blacks” of Apple’s OLED panels. The hands of the watch are actually also black; they just don’t look it in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfM7W9"&gt;But the cleverest aspect is the “loading wheel” at the 6 o’clock position that apes Apple’s boot indicator. The wheel is actually a fully functional mechanical second hand indicator. It’s comprised of cutouts in the Vantablack face, behind which the rotating gradient second hand wheel creates the loading effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFT6yD"&gt;For all the lightheartedness, though, the Swiss Alp Watch Final Upgrade is a serious piece of hardware: Moser is still a top-tier watchmaking company, and the hand-wound HMC 324 Manufacture movement inside is an incredible piece of machinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdnBBv"&gt;The H. Moser Swiss Alp Watch Final Upgrade is a limited edition model, with just 50 pieces planned — &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; you can afford the $30,800 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
