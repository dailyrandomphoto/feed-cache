    <title>TikTok to hide graphic videos behind warning screens</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGjR2O"&gt;TikTok has unveiled a newly updated set of community guidelines and tools, which include new warning screens on graphic videos, a new text-to-voice accessibility feature, and updated health resources. The update brings new vaccine information which will be added to TikTok’s coronavirus resource hub as well as resources to be shown if people search for certain terms, like those related to self-harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13cb8U"&gt;According to TikTok, the graphic content warning screens are meant to prevent the accidental viewing of content that some might find disturbing. The screen gives two options, letting users either view the clip or skip it entirely. More extreme content is removed from the service entirely, but the new warning labels cover clips that might be allowed for “documentary reasons,” scenes from horror movies, or violent scenes of animals hunting. This content is already not distributed via the service’s For You feed, TikTok says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ckdA9V_SvlM2WdJc3iWa9TCpj4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171466/Tips_and_Support.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching for certain terms will now link users to helpful resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MOkqzZ"&gt;Also announced today is a new text-to-voice accessibility feature which will read out text as it appears in a video. Its release follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;epilepsy warnings&lt;/a&gt; that the service recently started adding to photosensitive videos. Meanwhile, users who search for terms like “selfharm” or “hatemyself” will be shown help resources, and links to organizations like the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and Crisis Textline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VkqT5K"&gt;Vaccine information is also being added to TikTok’s coronavirus resource hub, which is accessible from the service’s Discover page, search results, and banners on videos related to the disease or vaccines generally. The hub will be updated to include commonly asked questions and answers about COVID-19 vaccines from public health experts like the Centers for Disease Control. TikTok says the resource hub has been viewed over 2 billion times in the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgnZPp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon generates millions of pounds of plastic waste</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Fulfilment Center In Sosnowiec" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LafGDAMDVdb4p6L4779sSBckNWw=/1x0:4738x3158/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514968/1143844285.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7d6hXP"&gt;Amazon’s plastic pollution is under scrutiny today with the publication of a new &lt;a href="https://plastics.oceana.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Amazons-Plastic-Problem-Revealed-December-15-2020-Oceana.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the nonprofit ocean advocacy organization Oceana. That report estimates that Amazon was responsible for 465 million pounds of plastic packaging waste last year. Amazon says that figure is overblown — by over 350 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQ6Iw0"&gt;Amazon claims that it uses about a quarter of Oceana’s estimate, according to an email from the company to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. If that’s the case, then Amazon still used more than 116 million pounds of plastic packaging in 2019. Amazon did not share what its total plastic footprint was either through a spokesperson or in its most recent sustainability report published last &lt;a href="https://sustainability.aboutamazon.com/pdfBuilderDownload?name=sustainability-all-in-september-2020"&gt;September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1pcw9u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L1DR7u"&gt;Oceana still stands by the figures in its report, despite Amazon’s objections. “[Amazon] continues to, in response to questions about plastic use, offer anecdotes about packaging weight rather than transparency,” a spokesperson for the organization said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Even the low number claimed by the company for its plastic packaging footprint would still be an enormous amount of plastic waste — enough to circle the earth over a hundred times in the form of air pillows and to cause very large problems for the oceans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zo99XR"&gt;The characteristic that makes plastic a sought-after packaging material for companies like Amazon happens to also make it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542109/plastic-waste-united-states-ocean-pollution-study"&gt;a big problem for the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; — it’s easy to move because it’s so light-weight. That makes it a great material for Amazon’s air pillows. It also means that it only takes a ride down a storm drain or a strong gust of wind to push plastic debris into the sea. Once the plastic is at sea, it adds to floating mountains of garbage and frequently winds up in animals’ bellies. In 2019, a whale off the shores of the Philippines was found with &lt;a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/03/whale-dies-88-pounds-plastic-philippines/"&gt;88 pounds of plastic&lt;/a&gt; in its stomach. And when humans eat fish that have ingested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20925449/microplastics-seafood-shrimp-trial-and-error-verge-science"&gt;microplastics&lt;/a&gt; left over from our trash, that plastic can end up in our bellies, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFWvQU"&gt;Oceana is concerned that as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611862/satellite-images-online-shopping-growing-footprint-warehouses"&gt;more people shop online&lt;/a&gt;, a greater share of leftover packaging will end up in the ocean. Since Amazon hasn’t publicly released numbers on its plastic pollution, Oceana tried to track it down itself. “What you don’t measure you cannot manage. So we had to estimate this,” says Anne Schroeer, a director of strategic initiatives at Oceana. “Obviously, it would be much better if Amazon would publish their plastic footprint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="DAE4xR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you don’t measure you cannot manage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DPCyhW"&gt;Oceana used a roundabout way to try to figure out how much plastic waste Amazon creates — which is why there’s such a big discrepancy between its figures and how much plastic Amazon says it actually used. To reach its 465 million pound estimate, the nonprofit gathered data from packaging industry analysts on the amount of plastic packaging used around the world. They then assumed that Amazon’s share of that plastic waste matched its share of the e-commerce market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgh7RE"&gt;Using that assumption, Oceana estimated that up to 22 million pounds of Amazon’s plastic packaging waste polluted freshwater and marine ecosystems across the world last year. It based &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; projection on a &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6510/1515"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this year that estimated that 11 percent of global plastic waste wound up in aquatic ecosystems. That study, however, isn’t limited to packaging waste, which makes it difficult to use its data as a way to pinpoint how much plastic pollution Amazon sent to oceans, rivers, and lakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgOA7O"&gt;“We share Oceana’s ambition to protect and restore the world’s oceans, and we support the reduced use of plastics. However, Oceana has dramatically miscalculated Amazon’s use of plastic,” a spokesperson for Amazon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2rq4Mh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We support the reduced use of plastics”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6MMYVd"&gt;Amazon has taken measures to cut down on how much trash comes from its packages such as sending items in their original packaging rather than boxing them up with more plastic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20986298/cyber-monday-black-friday-amazon-effect-recycling-cardboard-shopping"&gt;cardboard&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it’s cut more than 900,000 tons of packaging material since 2015. It also developed a padded paper mailer in 2019 as a recyclable alternative to the plastic packaging the company uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRRGRP"&gt;Although bags and envelopes made out of plastic film can technically be recycled, in reality, a lot of it is probably tossed away. In most cities, curbside recycling programs don’t accept plastic film. Most Amazon customers would need to bring it to a nearby drop-off location that does accept that type of plastic. Oceana surveyed 600 Amazon Prime customers in the US in May, of which less than two percent of shoppers said they made the trek to drop off their used plastic packaging. Historically, only nine percent of the entire world’s plastic waste has ever been recycled, according to a &lt;a href="https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/7/e1700782"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCPIZ6"&gt;Oceana believes Amazon can do more to slash its packaging waste, and sees the changes it’s made in India as a good example. This June, Amazon India announced that it &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/sustainability/amazon-india-successfully-eliminates-100-single-use-plastic-in-packaging-across-its-fulfilment-centers"&gt;eliminated single-use plastics&lt;/a&gt; in its packaging at its fulfillment centers. The move followed India’s goal of phasing out single use plastics by 2022. Amazon also offers “packaging-free” delivery in more than &lt;a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.in/operations/amazon-india-expands-packaging-free-shipping-to-more-than-100-cities"&gt;100 Indian cities&lt;/a&gt; — items are delivered in original packaging from the manufacturer and orders with multiple items are delivered in reusable totes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6MmXZ"&gt;Schroeer’s organization is pushing Amazon to bring reusable packaging to more places around the world. “[Amazon has] shown in India how fast they can really take action,” Schroeer says. “We are really confident that they can change quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZ2rlV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Signal adds support for encrypted group video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nPqAgxdkhk7jDBINMbDhgtHEGE0=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514888/group_calling_hero_compressed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group video calls are rolling out now.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pz2k9g"&gt;Encrypted messaging app Signal has added support for group video calls for up to five people, the &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Group calls can be started by tapping the video call button at the top of a supported group chat. Calls are “end-to-end encrypted — like everything else on Signal,” the company says. By default, participants are shown in a grid format, but you can swipe up for a view that focuses on individual speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNHhJm"&gt;With a five-person limit, Signal isn’t going to be replacing video conferencing services like Zoom any time soon, but the company says it’s working to increase the maximum number of call participants over time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xdu5Qefsi3OvwPq55cjFxnf-fB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171506/ezgif.com_gif_maker__7_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group calls default to a gallery view, but you can swipe up to focus on the person talking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jISbbY"&gt;Group video calls are available in the service’s iOS and Android apps, but for now they’re limited to new-style Signal group chats, and won’t appear in older, legacy chats. Signal launched its &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/new-groups/"&gt;new group chats back in October&lt;/a&gt;, adding support for @mentions, group admins, and more granular permissions. Older legacy chats will be upgraded to the new chat style in the coming weeks, Signal says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Driving the Mustang Mach-E, Ford’s first real electric car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1AKrO4-tW2lsONecCE-IRm96wLo=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514855/ahawkins_201212_4339_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Finally, an electric Ford of consequence &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yFtB1V"&gt;“Smooth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMp9RS"&gt;That was my wife’s first impression of the 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E as we swept down a New Jersey rural road through surprisingly thick curtains of fog last Saturday. It was night, visibility was almost nil, and all I could think about was that this was not the ideal driving test for Ford’s first electric vehicle of consequence. I wanted to drive fast along some mountain road with hairpin turns — it’s an electric Mustang! — but the fog and the slick road conditions ensured that I proceeded with caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nwbcJ"&gt;But I had to agree with her; it was smooth. From the whisper-quiet handling to the sinewy body style to the leather interior, the Mach-E radiated effortlessness. This is one of the most surprising — and satisfying — electric cars I’ve driven all year. After all, the Mach-E is the first new addition to the Mustang lineup ever. There’s no noisy V8 engine, no grumbling supercharger, no belching muffler, no non-existent backseat. Rather, it’s a zero-emissions electric crossover SUV that can easily fit two carseats in the backseats and a load of groceries in the trunk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ieTsRv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mustang fans are likely to be perplexed, but I think I can safely say that Ford has an unqualified hit on its hands&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ytu7mh"&gt;Mustang fans are likely to be perplexed, but I think I can safely say that Ford has an unqualified hit on its hands. And Ford definitely needed to knock this one out of the park. Its next EV, the electric Ford F-150, is also sure to be popular. But Ford needed to show everyone that it could make a powerful electric vehicle that was a blast to drive — and it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lTsYI"&gt;This isn’t just the opinion of a suburban dad who used the Mach-E to run errands and cart his kids around for three days. Everywhere I went, I was swarmed by curious on-lookers. It felt like hanging out with an automotive celebrity, based on the number of questions and requests for photos I got. People were drawn to this car. They had to know more. “An electric Mustang? An &lt;em&gt;electric&lt;/em&gt; Mustang?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SiSuS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yes, an electric Mustang&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw3mWK"&gt;There is something inherently disorienting about the Mach-E. The Ford Mustang is one of the most iconic cars in American history. It’s one of the original muscle cars, synonymous with drag strips and Steve McQueen’s epic car chase in 1968’s &lt;em&gt;Bullitt&lt;/em&gt;. Somehow, I can’t quite picture McQueen’s irascible detective catching air on the hilly streets of San Francisco in this version of the Mustang, though I do think Lieutenant Bullitt would appreciate the all-wheel-drive and 333 horsepower that this First Edition Mach-E was packing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYKVH8cQuNYqOg6PpJCa86jCW18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170050/ahawkins_201212_4339_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z0_pCxwn98NAJfd0Lgf17GrPHuw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22170049/ahawkins_201212_4339_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m3KsUG"&gt;This trim level is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;limited-production initial run&lt;/a&gt;, aptly named because it is the first version of the Mach-E to reach customers before the rest of the lineup reaches dealerships. It comes with special “First Edition” labels, brushed aluminum pedals, red brake calipers, and a bright blue paint job that Ford won’t offer on most other versions of the Mustang Mach-E. (Mine came in “carbonized gray metallic.”) For a suggested price of $59,900, you get an estimated 270 miles of range and a 0-to-60 mph time in the mid-five-second range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejq1af"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does it drive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atbZeB"&gt;Let’s start with the good stuff: the Mach-E is an absolute dream to drive. The handling was balanced and controlled. The acceleration was impressive without feeling showy or dangerous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbGdxz"&gt;There are three driving modes named Whisper, Engage, and Unbridled. Each offers specific changes to the driving experience such as steering tweaks, varied pedal feel, gauge-cluster graphics, and specifically tuned sound. When I first picked up the car, it was already in Unbridled mode, which is described as the most aggressive driving style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="voCHCn"&gt;I really enjoyed the sportiness of this driving mode, but my wife said it made her feel nauseous, so I toggled between Engage and Whisper for most of my time with the car. Engage is said to be the mode that feels most like a Mustang, with tight steering and punchy acceleration. Like Goldilocks, I found it to be just right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfL0gztbBL3GvuBu4lMieri5440=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19385955/sokane_191117_3793_6362.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6M8mj1"&gt;Ford says the Mach-E will eventually have Level 2 autonomy, meaning a partially autonomous driver assist system analogous to Tesla’s Autopilot. The top trim levels have all the hardware to support hands-free highway driving at launch, but the feature will not be available yet; it’s supposedly coming in one of the first major over-the-air updates for the automaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lXBIb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford was reluctant to release a completely silent Mustang into the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DUIukm"&gt;The version I drove had all the basic advanced driver assist functions, including blindspot detection, adaptive cruise control, lane-keep assist, and automatic emergency braking. They worked fine, nothing revelatory. The lane-keep assist was a little ping-pongy, but not excessively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5k3isV"&gt;While EVs are not necessarily known for their driving sounds, Ford was reluctant to release a completely silent Mustang into the world. The automaker created 30 unique sound profiles for the Mustang Mach-E, using &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and Batman’s Tumbler as a benchmark. When the EV is started, you get something akin to the ominous theme song from &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, or a low-key bass slap. Will this satisfy Mustang fans who crave the angry snort of a combustion engine? Doubtful, but I found it to be pleasant and easy to ignore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJjOK5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWCnTE"&gt;The Mach-E is undeniably a Mustang, from the tri-bar tail lights, to the long hood and short nose combo, to the similarities in the bodywork. But in case you forget, Ford has slapped its galloping pony logo on the grille, the steering wheel, the wheel center caps, and the rear hatch. Ford’s Blue Oval logo is there too, at the center of the windshield on top of the vehicle’s vision system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkIrZe"&gt;As a five-passenger crossover SUV, it felt appropriately sized, neither too large nor small, slotting in between the Ford Escape and Edge in length, but with a longer wheelbase than both. It’s lower than a typical crossover — three inches lower than the Escape and five inches lower than the Edge — which made it easier for my kids to get into their carseats by themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMAXsk"&gt;Thanks to a narrow A-pillar and a stubby front end, I felt like I could see everything I was supposed to from the driver’s seat. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522959/cadillac-escalade-2021-first-drive-safety-oversized"&gt;So many SUVs on the market today&lt;/a&gt; have gargantuan front-ends, creating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;dangerous front blind spots&lt;/a&gt; for drivers that could be fatal to people outside the vehicle, especially small children. Compact SUVs don’t typically have this problem, but it felt like Ford made the necessary design choices to ensure maximum visibility.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpGZo"&gt;The front end is certainly more aggressive than the Tesla Model Y’s. The multi-module LED headlights, which come with sequential turn signals that flash, are distinctive and expressive. And the hatchback rear-end is the Mach-E’s most crossover trait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QOrGm"&gt;The door handles are...well, missing. Not even a fold out or flip out handle. Instead there’s an itty-bitty fixed finger handle on the backside of the driver and passenger side doors. Above that there’s an electronic button that when pressed pops open the door. The rear doors also have a button, but no handle. It’s a very weird, idiosyncratic design choice, but I can’t begrudge Ford for doing it that way. The automaker says it designed these buttons-as-door-handles with children in mind, and I can see why; they were a big hit with my kids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AY9cBI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I was expecting to really dislike the faux grille, with its Yosemite Sam-looking handlebar mustache&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GHuL2O"&gt;Let’s talk about the grille for a quick second. I was expecting to really dislike the faux grille, with its Yosemite Sam-looking handlebar mustache. But I didn’t mind it so much. There was so much about this car that was just thoroughly enjoyable that the grille became an afterthought. Also, I didn’t realize that there was an actual functional grille below the fake one that sucks in air when you run the AC, or when you’re using a DC fast charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaM9x8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnUFpF"&gt;Speaking of charging, I can’t recommend using a DC fast charger enough when charging the Mach-E. I tried using the charger that came with the vehicle, plugged into a normal 120-volt outlet in my garage, but I shouldn’t have bothered. Ford says you can only add 3 miles for every hour of charging through this method; an overnight charge barely moved the needle. But using a fast-charger that was in the automaker’s FordPass Charging Network, I was able to get from 40 percent to 80 percent in less than 30 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HugW71IjJalOwZKryVb5BGXDtAc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171054/DSC_0156.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TWXtAi"&gt;(Full disclosure: I charged the vehicle when I was out by myself, sans wife and kids, and I can’t speak to anyone else’s patience with charging times but my own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHwRl2"&gt;A 240-volt charger would get me 22 miles for every hour of charging. Ford has plans to sell a faster home charger through a partnership with Amazon Home Services to help with installation — though it has yet to release pricing and availability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OBTwQ"&gt;Ford claims that its FordPass Charging Network is the largest public network in the country, featuring 35,000 plugs at 12,500 charging stations in the US and parts of Canada, some of which are DC fast chargers that can charge the Mach-E to 80 percent in about 38 minutes. But Ford didn’t build its own network like Tesla; rather it leverages third-party EV chargers.  The company is also offering two years of complimentary charging for all new Mach-E owners, which is a nice incentive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlH8KZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interior&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl9vxA"&gt;Inside, the seats are black leather with red stitching, a nice compliment to the grey paint job and the red caliper brakes. I found the driver seat to be very comfortable, and the headroom to be expansive. The panoramic sunroof was similar to what’s found in most Teslas these days, and was a joy to sit under. The soft fabric on the dash was a nice touch, and the air vents are real air vents, with open and close knobs, so this might be the car for you if you find Tesla’s digital air vents off-putting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D3Nogv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen is really enormous, floating above the dashboard like the ether&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11nAy3"&gt;What about that screen, though? Of course I’m talking about the massive 15.5-inch touchscreen that sits in the center of the dash. Like most other EVs on the market, the Mach-E is lacking in physical buttons, save for one at the bottom of the screen that serves as volume control. There’s another dial in the center console that works as the gear shifter — but other than that, everything is controlled through the touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BwTW2"&gt;The screen is really enormous, floating above the dashboard like the ether. The vertical tablet reminded me more of the Tesla Model S than the Model 3, or perhaps even more like those tablets you’d find embedded in a high-tech refrigerator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZ-d0qHDbfzyqtjSeCm45gwNJrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22171051/DSC_0146.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WrZXz4"&gt;I found the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971077/mustang-mach-e-ford-electric-sync-4-reveal-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;Sync 4 software&lt;/a&gt; to be one of the biggest drawbacks to the Mach-E. The layout was fine, but the user experience was lacking. Navigation was essentially worthless; after inputting a destination, the map offered no turn-by-turn directions and seemed to be lacking many street names. After a few non-starter attempts, I simply defaulted to CarPlay for most of my navigation and infotainment needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0rOs4"&gt;The Mach-E supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto wirelessly. The smartphone integration only uses the top half of the screen, though the latest version of CarPlay supports portrait orientation, so Apple could have used the whole screen if it wanted. That said, the image is large enough, about nine to 10 inches across, so you’re not really losing out with just half the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i83451"&gt;Tapping through the settings gets you to the camera feature, where you can see the 360-degree image of the car from the top down, as well the view from the rear-mounted camera. Ford uses a good amount of the screen to show you these images, which really helps when reversing or navigating tight spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkv0Ma"&gt;There are still a bunch of buttons on the steering wheel, as well as buttons on the turning and wiper stalks. Ford has found a nice balance between Tesla-style minimalism and the need to have some tactile controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XarhQW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhePND"&gt;This may sound like missing the forest for the trees, but the Mach-E has got me really excited for what comes next. This is a fantastic electric car, superbly designed and really fun to drive. But that said, I’d love to see Ford take all the basic elements and stick it into the body of an Escape — something that retails for less than $25,000 and would instantly be affordable to a bigger swath of customers. Give me a cheap, bland midsized Ford electric SUV to bang around town with my grubby kids, dammit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRRbwA"&gt;The Mach-E is a gorgeous car with a less than attractive price tag. The base model is the $43,895 Select version. Even with the $7,500 federal tax credit, that version will just barely crack the average sale price for a new car in the US. I get it; it’s an electric Mustang. That’s very cool, and cool costs extra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MUXQqt"&gt;I get why Ford chose the Mustang nameplate for its first EV. It wanted our attention. And now that has it, it’s time for Ford to show us what it can really do with this technology. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo completes Donkey Kong Country trilogy on Switch Online service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b-T_HDz4y2C-1Nd7I4OWueB4Fuw=/224x0:2569x1563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514486/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_14.43.51.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u0nxth"&gt;If you’ve been waiting until you could play all three SNES Donkey Kong Country games before picking up a Switch, you’re in luck. Nintendo has announced that the third game in the series, &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong’s Double Trouble, &lt;/em&gt;will be added to the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service this Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oOuwK"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/em&gt; game was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316848/donkey-kong-country-switch-online-july-release-date"&gt;added in July&lt;/a&gt;, while its sequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21439181/donkey-kong-country-2-nintendo-switch-online-september-games"&gt;followed in September&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBxpLX"&gt;Beyond &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country 3&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo Switch Online is also getting some deeper cuts this week. SNES titles &lt;em&gt;The Ignition Factor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Valis IV&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Tuff E Nuff&lt;/em&gt; are all coming on Friday alongside NES game &lt;em&gt;Nightshade&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5j0ciK"&gt;A Nintendo Switch Online subscription is required to access the Switch’s library of NES and SNES games, as well as giving you cloud saves and the ability to play Switch games like &lt;em&gt;Splatoon 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; in online multiplayer. It costs $3.99 a month, $7.99 for three months, or $19.99 a year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A show about Gawker proved too hot for Apple to handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OuhDsLWx-0TnonkXLoi3zjdjnCU=/74x0:1451x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68514003/Apple_introduces_apple_tv_plus_03252019_big.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wBwXnT"&gt;Apple has killed an upcoming Apple TV Plus show about &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, a now-defunct news organization, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/13/business/media/apple-gawker-tim-cook.html"&gt;a report by the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The show, called &lt;em&gt;Scraper&lt;/em&gt;, is one to add to the list of stories about Apple killing projects that touch things that are too sensitive or edgy for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpiG4e"&gt;When Tim Cook found out that Apple was working on the show, he reportedly sent an email saying that he was surprised to hear about it. He also mentioned he disliked Gawker. Although Apple has decided to kill the project, the show is back on the market, where another distributor could buy and finance it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iUD5oT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qJbxxa"&gt;This isn’t the first time Apple executives have stepped in to steer their TV service away from controversy. In 2018 Apple reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880"&gt;killed a movie about Dr. Dre&lt;/a&gt; for having gratuitous violence and sex, and Apple executive Eddy Cue has reportedly said that the service will never do two things: “hardcore nudity and China”. Apple directed show-runners to avoid portraying China in a negative light, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/apple-china-tv-protesters-hong-kong-tim-cook"&gt;Buzzfeed has reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqxZkY"&gt;The executive who bought the show, Layne Eskridge, is leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unkwOG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; was inherently controversial — as Tim Cook personally knew. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; outed him as gay in 2008. The Gawker Media Group&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;included several blogs; in 2010, one of them, &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/how-apple-lost-the-iphone-4-5520438"&gt;found and leaked the iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt; before it was launched. (Later, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/police-seize-jason-chens-computers-5524843"&gt;the reporter’s home was raided by police.&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1QCL6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; is appealing as a show precisely because the blog has such a mixed legacy. It was one of the media outlets that &lt;a href="https://gawker.com/who-wants-to-remember-bill-cosbys-multiple-sex-assaul-1515923178"&gt;revived interest in Bill Cosby&lt;/a&gt;, who was later convicted of aggravated indecent assault. It also reported on rumored misconduct by Louis CK and &lt;a href="http://defamer.gawker.com/tell-us-what-you-know-about-harvey-weinsteins-open-sec-1695071092"&gt;Harvey Weinstein&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JAHlR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker &lt;/em&gt;alums Max Read and Cord Jefferson are attached to the show. Jefferson has also written for &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Master of None. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVk0I9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;, it seems, was born to bring controversy to everything it touched — even four years after its death.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA approves genetically engineered pigs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-xfncn6mgrO_BijrsRxEvFonuKs=/0x0:2766x1844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513333/1228295080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pigs at a farm. | Photo by Marius Becker/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yOViUs"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration has approved genetically engineered pigs for use in food and medical products. The pigs, developed by medical company Revivicor, could be used in the production of drugs, to provide organs and tissues for transplants, and to produce meat that’s safe to eat for people with meat allergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rT4yX"&gt;“Today’s first-ever approval of an animal biotechnology product for both food and as a potential source for biomedical use represents a tremendous milestone for scientific innovation,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-its-kind-intentional-genomic-alteration-line-domestic-pigs-both-human-food"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uz6qT"&gt;The pigs are called GalSafe pigs because they lack a molecule called alpha-gal sugar, which can trigger allergic reactions. Alpha-gal sugar is found in many mammals, but not usually in humans. Alpha-gal syndrome (AGS), which causes a serious meat allergy, can happen after a bite from a lone star or deer tick. Though it hasn’t been tested specifically for people with AGS yet, the FDA has determined GalSafe pork products are safe for the general population to eat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izmh9N"&gt;In addition to their potential for safer consumption, there are several potential medical uses for GalSafe pigs. They could be used to make drugs like heparin, a common blood-thinner derived from animal tissue, safer for people with AGS. GalSafe pigs could also be useful in organ transplants, as alpha-gal sugar can be a cause of organ rejection. The pigs haven’t been tested for transplantation potential yet, so further research is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7ngQ3"&gt;This isn’t the first time the FDA has approved genetically modified animals. In 2009, the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/business/07goatdrug.html"&gt;approved genetically altered goats&lt;/a&gt; that produce a drug in their milk for preventing blood clots. Chickens that can make a drug in their eggs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9879678/gmo-chicken-transgenic-fda-approved-kanuma-drug-eggs"&gt;were approved in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, the same year salmon became the first genetically modified animal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/19/9761468/fda-approval-gmo-aquadvantage-salmon-safe"&gt;to be approved for eating&lt;/a&gt;. But the GalSafe pigs mark the first time the FDA has granted approval of a genetically altered animal for both human consumption and medical use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bXsTl"&gt;These pigs are not superpigs à la &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/6/27/15878944/okja-review-netflix-tilda-swinton-superpig-gyllenhaal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okja&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Atwood’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/6/8/11885596/margaret-atwood-dystopian-future-handmaids-tale-maddaddam-pigoons"&gt;pigoons&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference between them and their unaltered peers is a lack of a specific sugar molecule. Any developers that want to use GalSafe pigs will have to seek further FDA approval before using new drugs, transplants, or implants in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google discontinues the Google Home Max </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yiw50PMbDxPaaY4f-6lvydId1Ys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68513109/google_home_max_review_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F3D1fk"&gt;Google is no longer manufacturing the Google Home Max, its smart speaker designed with high-quality sound in mind, and it has sold out of the product on the Google Store, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And indeed, if you check the Google Home Max page &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/google_home_max"&gt;on the Google Store&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see that the white and black models are listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhs3q"&gt;Even though Google is discontinuing the Google Home Max, the company still plans to support it with software updates and security fixes. “Existing Google Home Max users shouldn’t worry as they won’t see any change in their service,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ll continue to offer software updates and security fixes to Google Home Max devices. We’re committed to delivering great sound and whole home audio features across all of our Assistant-enabled products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rLa5dQ"&gt;The Google Home Max launched in December 2017 for $399. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/20/16797728/google-home-max-smart-speaker-assistant-review"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dan Seifert found that the Google Home Max sounded good on its own, but wasn’t quite as nice as Sonos’ similar Play:5.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3dVUU"&gt;Pinterest is &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1506293/000150629320000291/pins-20201214.htm"&gt;settling a gender discrimination lawsuit brought by former COO Françoise Brougher&lt;/a&gt; for $22.5 million. Pinterest and Brougher will also jointly contribute $2.5 million to philanthropies supporting women and underrepresented minorities in the tech industry. The remaining amount will be paid to Brougher and her attorneys. News of the agreement was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Hyrb7"&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit. Brougher’s lawyer told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that while private agreements can be bigger, they don’t hold companies accountable in the same way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gj7KLq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is one of the largest in a publicly announced, individual gender discrimination lawsuit.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PX8CRY"&gt;In her complaint, which was filed in August, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/technology/pinterest-francoise-brougher-gender-discrimination-lawsuit.html"&gt;Brougher said she was paid less than her male colleagues&lt;/a&gt;, repeatedly left out of important meetings, and given gendered feedback by Pinterest CFO Todd Morgenfeld. When she spoke up about this mistreatment, she says she was fired. Morgenfeld still works at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pwDFl"&gt;The complaint followed public statements from &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks&lt;/a&gt;, two Black women on the policy team who said they’d faced racism and sexism at the company. Both said they were underpaid despite leading major initiatives at Pinterest, including banning anti-vax posts and putting an end to the promotion of plantation weddings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teivXW"&gt;Ozoma and Banks got less than a year’s severance when they left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkuZtj"&gt;Pinterest announced an outside lawyer was conducting &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-29/pinterest-hires-outside-lawyer-to-investigate-workplace-culture"&gt;an independent investigation into its culture&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of these allegations. Yet more stories continued to pour out. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21429619/pinterest-workplace-discrimination-finance-team-unequal-culture-bias"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published an article&lt;/a&gt; detailing new allegations of workplace discrimination and retaliation — particularly for women and people of color on the finance team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJMAsX"&gt;In a joint statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;Brougher and Pinterest said: “Pinterest recognizes the importance of fostering a workplace environment that is diverse, equitable and inclusive and will continue its actions to improve its culture. Francoise welcomes the meaningful steps Pinterest has taken to improve its workplace environment and is encouraged that Pinterest is committed to building a culture that allows all employees to feel included and supported.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pushes return to office to September and will test flexible work week</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HCPruE"&gt;Google has pushed back its return to the office until September, and will experiment with a hybrid model allowing some employees to work from home part of the week, the company said. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/google-delays-return-to-office-and-eyes-flexible-work-week.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Google CEO Sundar Pichai emailed employees Sunday about plans to test a flexible work week once conditions are safe for people to return. Google employees would work three days in the office and the rest of the week at home under the new plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeUpzt"&gt;Pichai said the company is testing whether such a model would lead to greater productivity and employee well-being. “No company at our scale has ever created a fully hybrid work force model — though a few are starting to test it — so it will be interesting to try,” Pichai wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43NPnw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/14/google-ceo-email-delays-return-to-sept-2021-no-permanent-remote-work.html?utm_term=Autofeed&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_content=Tech&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1607976163"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, however, Google’s hybrid work model would require employees to live within commuting distance to their offices, and a fully-remote option wasn’t offered. And some employees may not be eligible for a flexible work week, such as those who need access to specialized equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDdcvd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter, and Square are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/18/21261798/square-employees-work-from-home-remote-premanent-policy-ceo"&gt;among the companies&lt;/a&gt; to announce they would permanently extend their current fully-remote work policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05YOOq"&gt;Google was one of the earliest tech companies to go fully remote as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173994/google-coronavirus-north-american-employees-work-from-home-sick-leave-fund"&gt;telling employees in March&lt;/a&gt; to work from home to support social distancing. It previously said it would keep its 200,000 full-time and contract employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340038/google-remote-working-employees-2021-twitter-facebook-alphabet"&gt;working remotely until July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but has now pushed that date back again. &lt;/p&gt;
