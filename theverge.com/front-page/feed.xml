    <title>Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway will help Apple re-create the WeWork disaster for TV</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6tCPl"&gt;Apple’s television adaptation of the podcast adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;the real-life soap opera&lt;/a&gt; that was WeWork now has some major talent attached. Jared Leto, the soon-to-be leading vampire of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21062568/morbius-trailer-jared-leto-marvel-sony-pictures-venom-michael-keaton-vulture"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Anne Hathaway, are joining the Apple TV Plus series &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;as Adam and Rebekah Neumann, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anne-hathaway-joins-jared-leto-in-apple-wework-tv-series?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yk3ke5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;takes its name from &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;the Wondery podcast it’s based on&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the meteoric rise and fall of the real estate company that billed itself as a technology company. Many of WeWork’s problems (and, presumably, the plot of the show) were centered on the Neumanns. Adam Neumann was described as a risk factor in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm"&gt;the S-1 documents&lt;/a&gt; released before the company’s IPO, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;a profile of the Neumanns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; didn’t do much to dissuade anyone that they weren’t completely out of touch. For example, Rebekah Neumann reportedly fired multiple people because she “didn’t like their energy,” and Adam Neumann apparently had plans to become “president of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOao5t"&gt;In many ways, Hathaway and Leto could be perfect for the roles. Each actor has played eccentric one-percenters in the past. Leto took a more sinister turn as a wealthy replicant designer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16380562/blade-runner-2049-movie-review-harrison-ford-ryan-gosling-denis-villeneuve"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Hathaway had a lot of fun in &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s 8 &lt;/em&gt;as a film star at the center of a diamond heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4Ovkw"&gt;There’s no set release date for &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, but there are plenty of other in-development projects mining tech industry drama. If a gangly take on WeWork seems more your speed, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;Nicholas Braun is playing Adam Neumann&lt;/a&gt; in another version of the story. And if you prefer your scandals to be blood-oriented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305303/kate-mckinnon-will-play-elizabeth-holmes-in-theranos-miniseries-dropout-podcast"&gt;Kate McKinnon is lined up to play Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in a retelling of Theranos’ elaborate fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How many stocks will Robinhood let you buy? The numbers keep shrinking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1JKojNAEcU7cXgXGSRkRQakSZw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68741778/acastro_210129_1777_robinhood_0002.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3CzxO"&gt;Robinhood only wants users to have a limited number of shares of companies like GameStop, and that number keeps getting smaller and smaller. On Thursday, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;halted users’ ability to buy stocks&lt;/a&gt; that were associated with r/WallStreetBets, including GameStop, AMC, and Nokia, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;the company promised that users would be able to buy limited quantities on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"&gt;released a shifting support document&lt;/a&gt; that details just how limited things are — and to slightly paraphrase Lando, the deal’s getting worse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgRoXm"&gt;When trading opened earlier today, users were limited to owning five shares of GameStop in aggregate, meaning they could only own up to five — if they already had three GameStop stocks, they could only buy two more — but even that restriction hasn’t lasted. Soon, the number of shares you could buy in GME dropped to two and then finally down to a single share. That’s right: you couldn’t buy more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmkTns"&gt;As the day went on, and the markets closed, the number of restricted stocks kept increasing, from 13 to 23 to over 50 at the time you read these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3t8tB"&gt;Here’s the latest set of restrictions, according to &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"&gt;Robinhood’s support page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The list of Robinhoods restricted stocks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARCcNuCMmVbpJAnG0cjESkVv5Jo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268985/robn.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current list of over 50 restricted stocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yb850o"&gt;Included in the update are Starbucks, Beyond Meat, and General Motors. There are no longer any companies on the list that you can buy more than five shares for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6l3izy"&gt;Here’s the version of the chart we originally published:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B70-KTUxb74fFFbYpzGy-oIH32M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268592/robinhood_trade_restrictions_changed.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chart at 2 PM ET, with smaller limits and more companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nytJoU"&gt;And here’s what it looked like even earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chart showing Robinhood’s stock limits" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKGAU_kpDj2bQ2ZIFXi9JIGcVMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268376/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_9.29.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The limits chart at 12:30PM ET on January 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2EkVM"&gt;While GameStop is the most (in)famous of the Wall Street bets, it’s not the only one, and Robinhood has been expanding the list of which companies are limited throughout the day. One of the stocks added is AMD, which is currently limited to just a single stock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcu1u8"&gt;Robinhood is also limiting the options contracts you can get for certain companies. To put it extraordinarily simply: buying an options contract doesn’t mean that you actually own the stock. It allows the owner of the contract to buy or sell the stock later on at an agreed-upon price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoLLqC"&gt;For example, if GameStop is at $343 a share now, and I thought it was going to go up, I could purchase a call option to buy it at $400. If the stock went over $400, I could then make money by using my option to buy that stock, now worth more, for $400. However, those contracts expire, and if the stock price doesn’t rise as high as I expected, I may lose money, which is a situation &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/cohen-sundheim-lose-billions-to-reddit-traders-running-amok?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;many hedge funds are finding themselves in&lt;/a&gt;. (As always, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m not a financial adviser. This is just an explainer of the mechanics using arbitrary numbers.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke6sXd"&gt;If you buy an option, Robinhood could also theoretically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;sell it out from under you&lt;/a&gt; under certain conditions, something it’s warned it would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52Obq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tried to buy back my shares that robinhood sold without my permission and get this error message &lt;a href="https://t.co/pbcPrnozx7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pbcPrnozx7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Laoch (@LeCoque77) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeCoque77/status/1355243490339389440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFosWP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood attempted to justify the decision to halt and then limit trading, but, like the limited stocks, users aren’t buying it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;The app was review-bombed on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, with many users leaving one-star reviews, complaining that the company wasn’t living up to its goal of “democratizing finance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge3XGR"&gt;A Robinhood spokesperson pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to the aforementioned blog post, saying that the company has been clear with customers that it would be monitoring the situation and making adjustments “as needed,” and that the limits have been labeled as subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4 will return with a weekly series on Twitch and YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_igDWMViUIAqIETSZtyeOo6AYI=/0x0:2011x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742438/B4_G4_Final_Logo_V1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gpcQVY"&gt;The revival of G4, a network focusing on video games with programs like &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt;, is underway. The company announced today that it’s launching weekly series &lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; on Friday, January 29th. The series will air on Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRNDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; is part of the lead-up to the network’s return this summer. It will feature original sketches, music parodies, game reviews, and more. Viewers will also be able to provide feedback on that content via the network’s Reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOCEI"&gt;Twitter accounts for &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; teased G4’s revival &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/24/21337355/sdcc-2020-g4-tv-return-teaser-video"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; during the digital version of San Diego Comic-Con; both shows are expected to return. The network has been hunting for talent via a Twitter campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board wants your feedback on whether the company was right to ban Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00OM7NUGMbfXYp61DaS9IqPfhxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742361/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Thoo7t"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, the independent body empowered to review the social network’s most complex platform moderation decisions, is now &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1"&gt;accepting public comments&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;“indefinitely” ban former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the US Capitol attack on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbAFa6"&gt;The two posts in question include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;one-minute video Trump posted to his account on January 6th&lt;/a&gt; repeating false claims that the US election was stolen from him and offering words of sympathy to the Capitol rioters, some of whom were, at that moment, continuing to endanger the lives of Congress members and Capitol police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGP9tH"&gt;The second is a written post in which Trump wrote, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp;amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp;amp; unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love &amp;amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGmSfP"&gt;Facebook removed the video, took down the post, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218009/trump-facebook-ban-block-posting-24-hours-capitol-riot"&gt;subsequently banned Trump from its platform and Instagram for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; before saying the ban would remain in place indefinitely and at the very least through Inauguration Day. Although Trump’s pages remain live, he has not been permitted to post anything on Facebook or Instagram since January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RJuJBC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Oversight Board has the power to overturn Facebook’s decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IohG7"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;referred its decision to the Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; last week, citing the unprecedented actions company leadership felt compelled to take after Trump’s incitement of a riot that left five people, including one police officer, dead. The Oversight Board, which was formed last year and is made up of 20 experts from around the world with a large degree of background and employment diversity, expects to make a decision by the end of next month. The board took on its first batch of cases last month, but it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first rulings on five cases earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, upholding only one removal and overturning four others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kze5r"&gt;“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” Facebook’s Nick Clegg, its vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement last week regarding Trump’s ban. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.” Facebook is looking for clarity on not just whether it made the right decision to ban Trump, but also in what circumstances it should take comparable action against political leaders in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcgYBT"&gt;Now, the Oversight Board wants the public to weigh in, too. The board is looking for comments regarding whether Facebook’s decision “complied with the company’s responsibilities to respect freedom of expression and human rights” and what it should do should a similar situation arise in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs5gtJ"&gt;It’s also looking for comments on how the company should “assess off-Facebook context in enforcing its Community Standards,” particularly when there is a threat of real-world violence; how it should “treat the expression of political candidates, office holders, and former office holders”; and whether Facebook’s rules around account enforcement like suspensions and bans should be made more accessible, as well as appeals around that enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeSn5O"&gt;The board is similarly looking for feedback on what considerations should be made to ensure Facebook’s rules are applied consistently around the globe, especially when weighed against Facebook’s “newsworthiness” exemption. That exemption is what Facebook has relied on in the past when defending its choice to keep up controversial Trump posts, like Trump’s comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277135/facebook-walkout-protest-virtual-president-donald-trump-posts"&gt;regarding protests against police brutality last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and content from other world leaders that may violate its standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09gnjX"&gt;The Oversight Board says it will accept public comments until 10AM ET on February 5th, and it lists a number of requirements — submissions must be written in English and be no longer than two pages when written in 12-point Times New Roman font, to name a couple — that must be met to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xggYEa"&gt;The guidelines say only the Oversight Board will view the submissions to protect privacy and security, and those who decide to give feedback will be given a choice whether to have any of it published or attributed to them publicly as part of its deliberations and eventual ruling. The ruling will contain any public feedback in an appendix attached to the decision so long as the writer consents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUZhN6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s new Model S will automatically shift between park, reverse, and drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGrhcaVoFfoGTbFYgTnU9q3WcL0=/88x0:2629x1694/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742260/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_2.18.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WM9Rue"&gt;Tesla’s redesigned Model S and Model X will have a very unconventional and possibly controversial feature: automatic shifting between park, reverse, neutral, and drive (or PRND). There will be an option to change drive modes on the touchscreen, but CEO Elon Musk made the case for automatic switching on Twitter late Wednesday night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4Aymg"&gt;“Car guesses drive direction based on what obstacles it sees, context &amp;amp; nav map,” Musk tweeted. “After you drive without using a PRND stalk/stick for a few days, it gets very annoying to go back &amp;amp; use a shifter! You can override on touchscreen.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXWsrS"&gt;An internal Tesla document &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/01/27/tesla-new-steering-wheel-force-touch-buttons-autopilot-sensors/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;expands, slightly, on what Musk means by “guesses”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="G2Mxi5"&gt;The vehicle uses its Autopilot sensors to intelligently and automatically determine intended drive modes and select them. For example, if the front of Model S/X is facing a garage wall, it will detect this and automatically shift to Reverse once the driver presses the brake pedal. This eliminates one more step for the drivers of the world’s most intelligent production cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EwFIxz"&gt;That’s just one example, and we’ve asked Tesla for more, though the company reportedly no longer has a PR department and has not responded to questions &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;sends to its general press line since September 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRDvvh"&gt;The general idea behind the decision fits into the larger Silicon Valley ethos that Tesla subscribes to, though, of “eliminating friction.” The consequences of trying to automate PRND won’t be clear until people start taking deliveries of these new cars, which is supposed to happen in a matter of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XyCb2T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automakers have tinkered with PRND selectors for years, to sometimes deadly effect&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhWvSE"&gt;Automakers have tinkered with the look and location of drive mode selectors for years, enabled by the rise of automatic transmissions and the ability to change modes via software (also known as “shift by wire”). Many companies have ditched the classic steering wheel stalk in favor of a knob on the dashboard or the center console or separate physical buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1t2zjK"&gt;Others have tried to mix hardware and software, but it has not gone well. Fiat Chrysler had to recall more than 1 million Jeeps, Dodges, and Chryslers because the interface — which involved a lever and a button that always returned to center position — caused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/27/12043898/chrysler-jeep-dodge-electronic-gear-shift-recall-design-flaw-video"&gt;enough confusion that some people were run over by their own vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, this “rollaway” problem is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/20/11978044/anton-yelchin-jeep-recall-confusing-design-gear-lever"&gt;likely how actor Anton Yelchin died&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8G6NMg"&gt;So-called “mode confusion” is a real concern even in simpler designs. In 2018, one of Fiat Chrysler’s own commercials showed actor Kathryn Hahn &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/chrysler-pacifica-commercial-appears-to-show-actor-usin-1826674170"&gt;mistaking the Pacifica minivan’s rotary gear selector for a volume knob&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDTYm3"&gt;The removal of the PRND stalk that the Model S and Model X previously featured is part of a wider overhaul of the interior design of those vehicles, but it’s not the only one to conjure a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-steering-yoke/"&gt;debate about safety&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has ditched its circular steering wheel in favor of one that’s U-shaped — a decision that &lt;em&gt;Roadshow &lt;/em&gt;reports has already &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-model-s-yoke-steering-wheel-regulations-nhtsa/"&gt;drawn the interest of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal safety regulator&lt;/a&gt; for motor vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="liOkkC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Regulators have been concerned about mode confusion for decades&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUHbfZ"&gt;When asked whether NHTSA is looking into Tesla’s decision to automate PRND, the agency answered with a fairly stock response: “Manufacturers must certify their vehicles [to] meet applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards before putting them on the road,” and that it will require vehicles found noncompliant or that contain a safety defect to be recalled and may impose fines if a manufacturer does not recall vehicles in a timely manner.” The agency said it’s in “regular communication with manufacturers to discuss potential safety concerns” and that it reviews consumer complaints and company data to screen for safety risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il8ajw"&gt;While federal motor vehicle safety standard number 102 spells out the &lt;a href="https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-571/subpart-B/section-571.102"&gt;specific sequence of PRND&lt;/a&gt;, and number 114 covers some &lt;a href="https://ecfr.federalregister.gov/current/title-49/subtitle-B/chapter-V/part-571/subpart-B/section-571.114"&gt;really basic rollaway issues&lt;/a&gt;, it does not appear that any others would necessarily preclude Tesla’s automation or the lack of a physical selector. That’s despite NHTSA saying this &lt;em&gt;all the way back in 1999&lt;/em&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-1999-11-15/pdf/99-29684.pdf"&gt;response to BMW&lt;/a&gt; about using alternate gear selection methods like touchscreens, keypads, or voice controls: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GtPpbw"&gt;We are concerned that, as new designs for automatic transmissions that do not use a shift lever come into the market, there is nothing in Standard No. 102 to prevent misshifting in those vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Go read this profile of the trader whose huge bet on GameStop moved the entire market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GameStop Pares Rally To Double Digits As Retail Traders Pile In" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZGRCXXA25db2oNN1I_97F9Uhtc=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68741823/1230856652.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R92umW"&gt;The markets are not okay. If you’ve paid any attention to internet chatter this week, you’ve probably seen the names RoaringKitty or DeepFuckingValue — the bullish trader behind the recent GameStop stock phenomenon who’s inspired millions of retail investors to get behind his bet, which has nearly bankrupted at least one hedge fund. Until recently, the person behind the handles has been something of a mystery; they post their balance sheet with their millions in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l78uct/gme_yolo_update_jan_28_2021/"&gt;gains and losses on Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets forum&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s all there’s been to go on. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;Today, however, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;catches up with the 34-year-old behind the sensation&lt;/a&gt;: his name is Keith Gill, and he’s a father and certified financial analyst who lives in Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSWAUJ"&gt;In his own words, he didn’t expect any of this. He’s just a guy who used to market life insurance. (Though he does say that he might build an indoor track facility in his hometown of Brockton, Massachusetts, with his millions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41tgAP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, Gill doesn’t see himself as a rabble-rouser — “just someone who believes investors can find value in unloved stocks,” they write. “He never expected to have a legion of fans debating his identity online, or millions of dollars in his trading account.” As the excellent profile states, Gill began investing in GameStop in June 2019, when its stock was floating around $5 a share. “Earlier that year, the game retailer was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-videogame-market-shifts-gamestop-struggles-to-boost-sales-11546561467?ru=yahoo?mod=yahoo_itp&amp;amp;yptr=yahoo&amp;amp;mod=article_inline"&gt;hunting for its fifth chief executive&lt;/a&gt; in a little over 12 months. Mr. Gill kept buying,” the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports. “Although he never played much besides Super Mario or Donkey Kong, he saw potential for the struggling retailer to reinvigorate itself by attracting new customers with the latest videogame consoles.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ww7a3O"&gt;And he was right, of course, though not necessarily for all the reasons he might have expected. What’s powering this latest bonanza is what’s known as a short squeeze — hedge funds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;that shorted GameStop stock are now scrambling to cover their bets&lt;/a&gt;, which drives the stock price up further. As with most financial arcana, it both is and isn’t that complicated. What’s perhaps more interesting to consider is how Gill found an unloved stock two years ago, placed a bet because he believed in it, and is still somehow winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hlhz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The gorgeous Asus ROG Flow X13 will be over $1,000 cheaper without its eGPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 open, angled slightly to the left. The screen displays a white ROG logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cF4F1Kzzdcz6Mjd-cSs0JvEawts=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68741362/mchin_190421_4382_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1cu3Pn"&gt;The Asus ROG Flow X13 was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226223/asus-rog-flow-x13-zephyrus-duo-15-se-gaming-laptop"&gt;most-hyped announcements of CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, with good reason — how often do you see a 13-inch convertible gaming laptop, especially one that looks so cool? — but there was a catch. On Asus’ store, the ROG Flow X13 was only listed in a &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM120000009"&gt;$3,000 bundle&lt;/a&gt; with an XG Mobile eGPU. (This was also the only preorder link given to media at the time of the Flow X13’s announcement.) That’s a chunk of change, and it led most Flow X13 reviewers (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;myself included&lt;/a&gt;) to express reservations about the steep price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28ojtu"&gt;But a new clarification from Asus may change the game. On the latest episode of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=893&amp;amp;v=CSX8KX1X-FQ&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ROG Pulse&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Asus marketing manager Sascha Krohn indicated that the company does, in the future, plan to sell the ROG Flow X13 by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Flow X13 faces away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSo4fOM89irgc-Hkp-GSWmCdYE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259414/mchin_190421_4382_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Im6H9"&gt;“There was some misunderstanding about us only selling it as a bundle, so the XG Mobile together with the X13,” Krohn said. “So we do sell it as a bundle, but we also sell it separately, and that’s important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdZYM2"&gt;Asus marketing specialist Ryan Nesbit gave a rough starting price of “$1,200-ish.” There does seem to be some confusion here — when I contacted Asus about this, the company said it would be selling the standalone unit for $1,499, deviating from Nesbit’s claim. There’s also an ROG Flow X13 listed on Asus’s store for &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM090000008/ROG-Flow-X13-Ultra-Slim-2-in-1-Gaming-Laptop%2C-13.4%E2%80%9D-120Hz-Display%2C-GeForce-GTX-1650%2C-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HS%2C-16GB-LPDDR4X%2C-1TB-PCIe-SSD%2C-Wi-Fi-6%2C-Windows-10%2C-GV301QH-DS96"&gt;$1,699&lt;/a&gt;. Weird! I’ll update this article when this is all sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="puwec8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There was some misunderstanding about us only selling it as a bundle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQh7B5"&gt;That $1,200 price point, if Asus follows through on it, would be a game-changer for the ROG Flow X13. Many reviews pointed out that the X13’s value proposition as a $3,000 gaming laptop is iffy outside of a fairly niche audience. Its internal GPU is entry-level compared to the chips you’ll find in other gaming ultraportables, and external GPUs tend to incur a performance penalty. (After all, they’re outside the laptop.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0SFgL"&gt;But as a $1,200 general-purpose laptop, I’d be comfortable calling the Flow X13 an absolute steal. Not only is it great in almost every way — there’s a unique and sturdy design, a great keyboard, and an excellent 16:10 touchscreen with stylus support — but it includes an eight-core processor (starting with AMD’s Ryzen 5900HS). That’s undoubtedly the most powerful chip you can currently find in a 13-inch chassis. At $1,200, this laptop would be a no-brainer for anyone who needs a 13.4-inch laptop for CPU-intensive work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c0arlFjI5gWukpeTAw_YspHuARo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259416/mchin_190421_4382_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaDr6yxfUB0PJYoH7hWT-BLrbdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259415/mchin_190421_4382_0003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qu7d7b"&gt;The flipside of this: it means the GeForce RTX 3080 XG Mobile (in the bundle that’s listed on Asus’ site and also the one that was sent to reviewers) is pretty expensive. Krohn and Nesbit also indicated that an RTX 3070 edition of the XG Mobile will be available in the future, with an estimated price of “around eight to nine hundredish.” Basic math suggests this would make the RTX 3070 XG Mobile as much as $1,000 cheaper than the RTX 3080 configuration in the bundle that’s currently listed. That’s quite a large delta, but I guess we’ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YDJh4"&gt;It’s not clear from the podcast whether Asus plans to sell the RTX 3070 XG Mobile on its own or whether this eGPU will be sold in a cheaper Flow X13 bundle. We’ve asked Asus for clarification here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwvVYi"&gt;You can view the full episode below. The pricing discussion begins just over 15 minutes in.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook content moderators in Ireland demand work-from-home rights </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/88oCZMwo7uJ4la87PTd5pZKEofM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68741144/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="syJ48e"&gt;Facebook content moderators in Ireland met with Deputy Prime Minister Leo Varadkar today to demand work-from-home rights. They say the company forced them back into the office, even as COVID-19 cases spiked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6475GP"&gt;“We should be working from home just like employees,” said Ibrahim Halawa, a former political prisoner and law student who works as a Facebook content moderator. “We should have the same mental health care they get, the same benefits—but we don’t. Facebook can’t exist without us, and it should stop treating us as second-class citizens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwnNmX"&gt;Since December 30th, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55493290"&gt;Ireland has been in a level five lockdown&lt;/a&gt;, meaning household visits are banned and nonessential retail businesses are closed. &lt;a href="https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/casesinireland/epidemiologyofcovid-19inireland/COVID19%20Daily%20infographic.pdf"&gt;The country currently has 192,645 confirmed COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEBm1p"&gt;In August, Facebook announced employees would be able to work from home until July 2021. Two months later, content moderators working for the subcontracting firm CPL in Dublin were told to return to the office. The company had categorized them as essential workers, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/23/facebook-moderators-forced-to-work-in-dublin-office-despite-high-tier-lockdown"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. High-risk contractors were exempt, but those with vulnerable family members had to comply. Moderators had previously been told the office would close for 72 hours if there was a confirmed COVID-19 case. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/23/facebook-moderators-forced-to-work-in-dublin-office-despite-high-tier-lockdown"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported that after three cases, the office remained open&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0N1U"&gt;During a press conference today, Halawa said Varadkar agreed to send a letter to Facebook and Covalen, a CPL subsidiary, inquiring about the disparate treatment between contractors and employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQMXwK"&gt;“They’ve made it abundantly clear that our health &amp;amp; safety and lives don’t matter to them,” said Paria Moshfeghi, another Facebook content moderator. “They’re forcing us into the office, putting us and our families at risk of COVID-19, even though our colleagues keep getting COVID. Facebook employees working on the similar content as us are safe and allowed to work from home. Why aren’t we?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5F7YJK"&gt;Both Halawa and Moshfeghi stressed that other Facebook moderators want to come forward but are scared because of the strict NDAs workers are forced to sign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3D8sO"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Covalen spokesperson said: “Employees with underlying conditions are not required to work from the office, they are working on content that can be reviewed at home. Some employees who are living with vulnerable people are also working from home, this is reviewed on a case by case basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UImD6Q"&gt;Tech companies have faced mounting pressure to moderate content during the coronavirus pandemic. In March, YouTube announced it would be relying more heavily on AI to enforce its content moderation policy. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448916/youtube-automated-moderation-ai-machine-learning-increased-errors-takedowns"&gt;the company said it was bringing back human moderators&lt;/a&gt;, noting AI hadn’t been as effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tp15zm"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYq8s1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 29th, 5:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated with a statement from Covalen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wp9Ac"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0hkmH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Deaf people face unique challenges as pandemic drags on</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For many, gaps in communication have only worsened&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AS2QIi"&gt;After spending five days at a mental health hospital in October, Quinn West left feeling as though they hadn’t gained much from their stay. They spent most of their time in their room, finding group therapy pointless because, as a Deaf person, they couldn’t fully participate in conversations. They communicated with hospital staff primarily through writing and lipreading. They repeatedly asked for an American Sign Language (ASL) interpreter, but in-person interpretation wasn’t an option because of COVID-19 restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnB8GY"&gt;Although West could use Video Remote Interpretation, they found they couldn’t necessarily rely on it. “[It] is tricky when the room has bad audio quality, the interpreter constantly gets disconnected, and the iPad is not always catching everything happening in the room,” says West. Every new call also means a new interpreter, and having to adjust to a different signing style every time only adds to the stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkipcd"&gt;West’s hospital experience is not an outlier. Many deaf and hard of hearing people have been alone in hospitals without consistent ways to communicate with doctors and staff, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.nad.org/coronavirus/media-kit/"&gt;National Association of the Deaf&lt;/a&gt; (NAD). For deaf people — in hospitals, at work, in their homes — the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gaps in communication access, from a lack of reliable technology to an underutilization of certain tools when people need them most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CWA9ul"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Isolation is intensified for deaf people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nc7ieY"&gt;“I’ve learned to always be wary when I see [mentions of] accessibility, many times it is faulty or access that isn’t good enough,” says West. While social distancing has been hard on just about everyone, the isolation is intensified for deaf people because their access is so often an afterthought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtfI27"&gt;For many people, face masks were one of the first, most obvious causes of trouble. “Before, I would rely on lipreading and residual hearing to communicate with everyone from cashiers to bank tellers to the dentist and more,” says Beatrice Bachleda, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCak38d7-WkBjzLMAAPBhfQg/featured"&gt;Deaf yoga instructor&lt;/a&gt;. “With masks, I sometimes don’t even realize if anyone is talking to me which can lead to some pretty awkward encounters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLidq8"&gt;As masks became the norm, even people who didn’t realize they had hearing loss noticed they were struggling to understand speech. Around the beginning of the pandemic, audiologists noticed an uptick in patients coming in with concerns about their hearing. People who already had hearing aids were having more difficulty understanding speech, says Catherine Palmer, former president of the &lt;a href="https://www.audiology.org/"&gt;American Academy of Audiology&lt;/a&gt;. People with mild hearing loss, who weren’t previously using hearing aids, suddenly found that they couldn’t understand speech without them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NudvJj"&gt;“Masks create two barriers for individuals with any level of hearing loss,” says Palmer. They reduce visual cues — mouth movement, facial expression — that support communication for people with reduced hearing, while also decreasing the transmission of certain frequencies of sound that lend to clarity of speech.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpVsSB"&gt;Some have pointed to masks with transparent windows to make communication easier for people who depend on lipreading and facial expressions. But they’re not widely used, and “the weakness is that it’s not something the deaf person can do or wear; the person we are trying to understand must wear them,” says Jenna Beacom, a Deaf writer and editor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lKUWTK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Transparent masks are a difficult trade-off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cF6WyJ"&gt;The materials used in transparent masks also dampen sound more than cloth masks, making for a difficult trade-off for people who use both residual hearing and visual cues to understand speech. The dampening effect is also a problem for people who don’t have hearing loss but struggle with auditory processing, like many autistic people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xys2BD"&gt;Transparent masks aren’t the only imperfect solution. Every deaf person’s needs and preferences are unique, and sometimes one accessibility option isn’t enough. “When I had to get a COVID test I had a hard time understanding over video phone, it would have been easier for me to have someone email me or text me,” says West. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSx7Lr"&gt;Some people have been left with very few communication options because of the pandemic. Social distancing is particularly hard to navigate &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/they-are-deaf-and-blind-and-social-distancing-has-now-taken-their-ability-to-touch/2020/04/08/de5a9d42-79ae-11ea-9bee-c5bf9d2e3288_story.html"&gt;for DeafBlind people&lt;/a&gt; who use tactile ASL, which involves touching hands while signing. In many contexts, including hospital visits, tactile ASL is difficult to accommodate for: video calls aren’t feasible, and COVID-19 restrictions may prevent a family member or friend from assisting with communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hFI9Eg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s sometimes more to do with attitudes rather than the technology itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DrnkA0"&gt;While some accessibility problems are difficult to address even with multiple tools available, in many cases, it comes down to a lack of willingness to use existing technology like video captions and interpreting services. “Over time, I see that technology is slowly catching up,” says Bachleda. “I do wish we could progress a bit faster because there are still lots of gaps though, and it’s sometimes more to do with attitudes rather than the technology itself.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb9nWR"&gt;The proliferation of virtual events and remote work has made some things easier for deaf people, but there are still challenges. Thanks to the move to more online training, Bachleda was able to advance her yoga certification after years of being unable to arrange in-person classes with an interpreter. She says that with online resources she can get “some semblance of access,” but that access has often been limited to auto-captions. “Asking anyone to provide an interpreter is almost always a tough battle,” she says, and she’s been told “no” enough times that she rarely asks anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3yYuw"&gt;“So much is video-based, and so little of what’s video-based is accessible,” says Beacom. She’s been disappointed by many virtual events, which either had no captions or used frequently inaccurate auto-captions, in addition to missing out on family Zoom calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="s6b6HJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The National Association for the Deaf filed a lawsuit against the White House&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1e9l7a"&gt;The battle for ASL interpretation has been fought all the way to the level of national COVID-19 briefings. In August, the NAD &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/us/politics/asl-interpreter-lawsuit-coronavirus-trump.html"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the White House after months of briefings with no ASL interpreters. Part of the argument in the White House’s original response was that the briefings included closed captioning and that transcripts were available for each one. But even if live captions are accurate, people whose first language is ASL may not completely understand English. “We have received many complaints from deaf and hard of hearing people unable to understand from the briefings what they are supposed to do or avoid to stay safe and healthy,” says the NAD’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPyHUe"&gt;Because interpretation and captioning on live TV are so often unreliable, many deaf people don’t bother watching news stations. “My local news has had interpreters but sometimes, they cut the interpreter off or graphics and captions will be covering their window and it makes it complicated to view,” says Rikki Poynter, a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/rikkipoynter"&gt;Deaf YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; and activist. “Obviously, the Trump administration never gave interpreters to begin with so that was a struggle to keep up with if captions were also being wonky at the same time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9HpCtu"&gt;Between struggling with masks and being left out of everything from virtual hang-outs to COVID-19 briefings, many deaf people have found the pandemic taking a serious toll on their mental health. “Life has been much more isolating,” says Poynter. She had already struggled to communicate with people who don’t know ASL, “now everyone is having zoom parties and stuff, but deaf folks tend to be uninvited because we’re not as thought about and the lack of accessibility (small cameras, laggy Internet, etc) make it extremely difficult to take part in any of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision episode 4: Ready, A.I.M., theorize </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3t_KbB798F_OJcRLtcJo9HDUt6U=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740840/MEX2090_104_comp_v007_r709.00099148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RKEBN2"&gt;Certain names have popped up again and again over the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232745/wandavision-episode-one-two-recap-theory-sword-shield-age-of-ultron-skrulls"&gt;few episodes of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s one organization we haven’t discussed yet: A.I.M.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxcxLC"&gt;Before diving into this week’s theories, however, let’s take a second to acknowledge just where the show is within the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s timeline. Marvel Studios previously confirmed that &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/984305/9358?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;took place just after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but thanks to a sad revelation about Monica Rambeau’s mom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251874/captain-marvel-review-marvel-mcu-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson"&gt;Maria Rambeau&lt;/a&gt;, that plays at the beginning of the fourth episode, we know it’s about three weeks since the blip. (Remember, the “blip” is how they referred to Thanos’ great snappening, referencing events that took place in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17276030/avengers-infinity-war-review-marvel-iron-man"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqzFDM"&gt;Three weeks is a relatively fresh period for people — especially those who returned to Earth after fading into dust. For Wanda, that’s exactly three weeks since she turned into dust, came back to fight Thanos, and apparently moved to New Jersey to start a new life in a fictional town. The last three episodes have focused entirely on her perspective, but episode 4 introduces — or, rather, &lt;em&gt;re&lt;/em&gt;introduces — a couple of key characters who act like our eyes and ears within Westview, trying to figure out what Wanda’s doing and who’s possibly controlling her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgg9Jb"&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Warning: Consider this your warning about inevitable &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WandaVision &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;episode 4 spoilers. Turn back now or forever hold your tweets about spoilers.] &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMw_-Rnz1j025PAzPZCv9YewiPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268285/MEX2350_104_comp_v009_20201209_r709.1045.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xbpk4"&gt;We’ve talked quite a bit about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243271/wandavision-episode-3-recap-explainer-mephisto-agatha-harkness-tommy-billy-sword"&gt;Mephisto in these columns&lt;/a&gt;, a demonic devil who has deep ties to Wanda, Vision, and the greater Marvel universe-at-large. There’s another theory we have to discuss today and, while I think it’s less likely, there are too many possibilities to ignore its potential. I’m so excited I get to write these next few words: let’s go back to &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RitAyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3 &lt;/em&gt;introduced Marvel Cinematic Universe fans to a company called Advanced Idea Mechanics, better known as A.I.M. Headed by &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH_Vr7aVHng"&gt;Guy Pearce’s Aldrich Killian&lt;/a&gt; in the film, A.I.M.’s role in the comics is slightly different, and that’s where a few theories lie. In the comics, A.I.M. is a think tank of sorts belonging to several of the world’s smartest scientists who believe in harnessing and using technology to acquire unspeakable power. There are three specific reasons that some fans believe A.I.M. has ties to &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; and, more importantly, suggestions about what those could mean for the show’s big villain reveal: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t8ldRm"&gt;The first appearance of a bee suit in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s second episode &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ioPTdN"&gt;Strucker watch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="drDTWK"&gt;Hexagons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbAJtZ8Ijgz3fnjU7vkqWwIAEuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268290/wandavision_bee.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FC03fp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bees? Beads? Bees!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cqWUSv"&gt;A man in a beekeeping suit emerging out of a sewer in the middle of an empty suburb late at night would be unusual in any world, but in Marvel, bee suits are deeply tied to A.I.M. The organization’s seemingly disposable henchmen are referred to as “beekeper guys,” as our &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2021/1/15/22231577/wandavision-episode-2-easter-eggs-beekeeper-strucker-watch-aim"&gt;sister publication &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;. A man emerging out of a sewer to see what’s going on with Wanda inside her own fictional reality could refer to a henchman completing a job for A.I.M. Now, the fourth episode explains his appearance — he’s a man named Franklin — as an agent of S.W.O.R.D. entering Wanda’s prism to try to make contact with the mutant. Hence the S.W.O.R.D. logo on the back of his suit — but why does he appear as a beekeeper in Wanda’s universe? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0XuVz"&gt;As actress Kathryn Hahn recently &lt;a href="https://tvline.com/2021/01/28/wandavision-spoilers-agnes-agatha-harkness-kathryn-hahn/"&gt;said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;TVLine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “there are so many layers” to what’s happening on the show. Agent Franklin could just be a S.W.O.R.D. lackey sent in to try to get in touch with Wanda. But Marvel also has a history of organizations being run by shady figures. That’s where &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s newest character comes in — Tyler Hayward, acting director of S.W.O.R.D. Part of it is my own gut feeling of “I don’t trust him” that comes with being a longtime Marvel fan and still getting unnecessarily angry at the name Alexander Pierce. Something about this guy just seems &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt;. He’s a Marvel Cinematic Universe original, too, so there’s no comics precedence to inform our hypothesizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFezfc"&gt;Could Hayward be a member of A.I.M.? If so, could A.I.M. be using one of their deadliest creations — the Cosmic Cube — to help warp Wanda’s reality? That’s where one of our other connections that could tie A.I.M. to Wanda’s new world comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v_8wmWNIiBjyseyK4W4C5M--6Tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268297/strucker_watch.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9zABd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A.I.M.? Hydra? What?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RoWTVI"&gt;In the second episode, we get a commercial for a fictional product called the Strucker watch. The commercial seemed to incorporate Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, a Hydra sleeper agent within S.H.I.E.L.D. who is seen holding custody of Wanda and her twin brother Pietro in a &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; post-credits&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;scene and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/22/8464479/avengers-age-of-ultron-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;’s opening battle&lt;/a&gt;. In the comics, Baron von Strucker helped start A.I.M., using it as an organization to create top-secret, dangerous weapons for Hydra during World War II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYszq"&gt;Coincidence? Maybe, but this is Marvel Studios. Nothing is ever a coincidence. It’s also not like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;is trying to shrink away from its Hydra connections. The third episode contains a commercial for Hydra Soak, which is a reference to a blue soap created by the evil organization that is used to place false memories in people’s heads, according to Agent Coulson in a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejK6jOzuuyc"&gt;season 4 episode of &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;If A.I.M. and Hydra are involved with warping Wanda’s mind to create a false reality, the only reason to do so is to use Wanda until she can become — or produce — a weapon they need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqdTMU"&gt;Keeping Wanda because of her weapon potential is the same reasoning behind the much more circulated fan theory about Mephisto being the figure behind Wanda’s current self-imprisonment. It’s still my preferred theory, especially considering that Marvel Comics put Mephisto in a splashy promo for the “next big thing” just as &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;started rolling, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoshuaYehl/status/1354630810243002368"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s Joshua Yehl&lt;/a&gt; pointed out on Twitter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6f6dy"&gt;If Mephisto seems like the most likely candidate for &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s big villain reveal (or at least, &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/wandavision-nightmare-villain/"&gt;part of the villain reveal&lt;/a&gt;), it may seem strange that people are still talking about A.I.M. That’s where geometry comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3YTguY7-jNImFp01J7RK7SX-xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268312/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_12.10.32_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wanda’s prism, as rendered in the shape of a hexagon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Yz9WzX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hexagons for everyone &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pg5ewV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;has an affinity for shapes — specifically hexagons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UD0rYE"&gt;Variations of A.I.M.’s logo have been &lt;a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvels-avengers4475/images/3/39/AIM.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200901133802"&gt;designed in a golden hexagon&lt;/a&gt;. Remember the “beekeeper” reference? Honeycomb also takes the shape of a hexagon. Subtly referring to the shape throughout the series could hint at A.I.M.’s work at play. Hexagons could just be a rad shape that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s team is into but, again, this is Marvel Studios. There are rarely coincidences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KxNZ"&gt;Monica Rambeau wears hexagon-shaped earrings in the show’s third episode, for example. Then the fourth episode 3D renders Wanda’s fake town, which is in the shape of a hexagon. Episodes fade out in the shape of hexagons, not circles traditionally associated with older shows coming to an end. Not to mention that Jimmy Woo basically writes down on his giant whiteboard of clues “what’s going on with these hexagons?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BN2Xjg"&gt;The hexagon could be a reference to the number of points on the shape — six — which is also the number of Infinity Stones. (Vision is, of course, effectively powered by the Mind Stone.) Or hexagons could be a subtle play on the prefix hex, a Germanic term that means witchcraft. Wanda is a witch, and we’re pretty sure her neighbor Agnes is really the ancient witch, Agatha Harkness. Or hexagons could allude to the correlation between the number six and the devil (666), which may be a subtle nod to Mephisto. There are a lot of possibilities here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PLrWqA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if it is A.I.M.?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nFjEJS"&gt;I really don’t think A.I.M. is the big bad, so this is just fun speculation I don’t believe will come true — what if everything is leading up to M.O.D.O.K? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVT6jy"&gt;By now you may be thinking, “Why are there so many acronyms in Marvel names?” Reader, I have the same question. M.O.D.O.K. is pretty nifty, though! M.O.D.O.K, which stands for Mechanized Organism Designed Only for Killing, was at one time the leader of A.I.M. He’s the type of guy who can bridge the first few phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the upcoming cosmic phase — not to mention M.O.D.O.K. has deep ties to both the Avengers and X-Men universes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOAVtw"&gt;Part of the reason I’m pretty sure it’s not M.O.D.O.K, other than it not really lining up, is the lack of interaction between he and Wanda. Sure, there’s an &lt;em&gt;Avengers vs. X-Men &lt;/em&gt;moment, but we’re not setting up &lt;em&gt;Avengers vs. X-Men&lt;/em&gt;. At least, not yet. Whether any of this happens — or all of it happens in some capacity — is part of the mystery that makes &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;so fun. As weeks go by, we’ll get a clearer answer of just who’s behind this entire ordeal. Who knows? Maybe it was just Wanda all along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eP9bcJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uwpr3A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
