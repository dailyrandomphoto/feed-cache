    <title>Nvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yoWjRFWgi7VVIAVj2rF52GsE5I4=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304541/twarren_rtx3080_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eIq7tp"&gt;Nvidia is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR” identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeYpom"&gt;“This reduced hash rate only applies to newly manufactured cards with the LHR identifier and not to cards already purchased,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/05/18/lhr/"&gt;says Matt Wuebbling&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head GeForce marketing. “We believe this additional step will get more GeForce cards at better prices into the hands of gamers everywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5G6za"&gt;These new RTX 3060 Ti, RTX 3070, and RTX 3080 cards will start shipping later this month, and the LHR identifier will be displayed in retail product listings and on the box. Nvidia originally started hash limiting with the RTX 3060, and the company has already committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/18/22290362/nvidia-will-not-reduce-3060-ti-3070-3080-3090-eth-mining"&gt;not limiting the performance of GPUs already sold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8UNL2SWMaPphvn_Juz9aP60yGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22129713/twarren_rtx3060_ti_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3060 already has a mining limit in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxMD4R"&gt;While Nvidia tried to nerf mining with the RTX 3060, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining"&gt;accidentally released a beta driver&lt;/a&gt; that unlocked hash rates and increased performance. That’s been reinstated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409838/nvidia-rtx-3060-etherium-cryptocurrency-mining-limit-back-driver-update"&gt;more recent drivers&lt;/a&gt;, but the beta drivers are out in the wild now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFJL1l"&gt;Nvidia’s new LHR cards are part of a broader effort to make its latest 30-series GPUs less desirable to cryptocurrency miners. PC gamers have been trying and failing to get their hands on new graphics cards for months due to the great GPU shortage, and miners have been blamed for part of the shortages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SKO0Q"&gt;Nvidia offers a separate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/cmp/&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22053195__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cryptocurrency Mining Processor&lt;/a&gt; (CMP) for Ethereum miners instead. These cards include the best performance for mining and efficiency, but they won’t handle graphics at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MheWDl"&gt;Nvidia’s move to nerf new cards will undoubtedly drive up prices for existing 30-series GPUs that don’t have these restrictions in place. It will also likely mean the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419668/nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-leak-may-launch-rumors"&gt;rumored RTX 3080 Ti card&lt;/a&gt; will have similar cryptocurrency mining limits in place, as this card is expected to be announced later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s redesigned MacBook Pros with next-gen in-house chips could arrive early this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2KPZT8bBcXtzv-lbkykTsxrzrQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304510/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s first computer with its new M1 in-house chip, the 2021 MacBook Air, exceeded our expectations. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mJ4Nkl"&gt;The performance of Apple’s M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;exceeded our expectations&lt;/a&gt; and made the 2020 MacBook Air the most impressive laptop we’ve used in years (it’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;done wonders for the redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt;). So it’s not too surprising, as per &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this morning, that Apple is readying a whole slate of Macs using next-gen versions of the company’s in-house chips. The details sound very promising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbwIIR"&gt;The story, from reliable Apple-watcher Mark Gurman, says the company is preparing to unveil redesigned MacBook Pros in 14-inch and 16-inch screen sizes “as early as this summer.” Not only will the machines have a redesigned chassis, but they’ll also bring back the beloved magnetic MagSafe charger (though it’s not clear in what form) and previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and SD card slot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOnICU"&gt;The return of the SD slot to the MacBook Pro — originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;rumored in January&lt;/a&gt; — will be extremely welcome for many professionals who use the port to quickly transfer videos and images from cameras’ SD cards. And though we’d seen reports that MagSafe might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;making a comeback for the MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, we didn’t know that MacBook Pro might be getting it, too.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZvciV"&gt;After the new MacBook Pros have been unveiled, Gurman says Apple plans to release “a revamped MacBook Air, new low-end MacBook Pro and an all-new Mac Pro workstation.” A higher-end Mac mini and larger iMac are also reportedly in the works, with all of the new machines boasting chips “that will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEXfU7"&gt;Chips for the MacBook Pro will reportedly come in two variants, codenamed “Jade C-Chop” and “Jade C-Die.” Compared to the M1 chips — which have four high-performance cores, four energy-efficient cores, and eight graphics cores — the new designs will have eight high-performance cores, two energy-efficient cores, and either 16 or 32 graphics cores. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also says they’ll have an updated Neural Engine for machine learning tasks and support up to 64 gigabytes of memory compared to 16 gigabytes for the current M1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J42sWJ"&gt;None of this is particularly shocking. We’d all expected the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips to be “the best ever” (as they always are, every year, per Apple’s marketing spiel), but it’s still good to hear that Apple is preparing such a wide-ranging overhaul of its Mac lineup. The M1 chip breathed new life into Apple’s computers, what might the M2 do next?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a new, unlocked iPhone 11 Pro for 23 percent off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z4YTysWdBJIMmGDsypH66VavivA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304409/akrales_190914_3666_0114.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j3midb"&gt;Woot is hosting a good deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868727/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-review-camera-battery-life-screen-midnight-green-price"&gt;iPhone 11 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, 2019’s high-end iPhone model. It debuted for $1,000, but Prime members &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140756?sid=VergeDeals051821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-iphone-11-pro-factory-unlocked-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can get one new and unlocked for $770&lt;/a&gt;. At this price, you’ll get a 64GB phone in either midnight green or silver. If you want more storage, the 256GB model costs $890, which is 23 percent off its original price. All the way at the top sits the 512GB iPhone 11 Pro for $1,000, a $350 discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k5B0Ze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10506005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KgVaJi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435116/google-io-2021-rumors-android-12-pixel-buds-a-series-chip"&gt;Google I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; kicks off later today, and we expect to see more on its upcoming Android 12 software. One such phone that’ll be among the first to be able to run it is the Google Pixel 3, and you can get that device for just &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=UnlockedGooglePixel3Woot051321&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3-64gb-unlocked%3Fref%3Dw_ngh_dd_el" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$160 new at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. We covered this deal recently, but it’s still happening and it’s still very good if you want a phone that has broad carrier support, an IP68 waterproof build, and of course, a great camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SNFAuZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10498496"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eVQmRe"&gt;The Pixel 3 XL is also discounted at Woot, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13140756?sid=VergeDeals051821&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgoogle-pixel-3xl-unlocked-new-not-pink%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_lnd_cat_elec_2_6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing just $215&lt;/a&gt;. It has a bigger display than the Pixel 3, and it’s in QHD resolution instead of FHD. It also has a bigger battery and more screen real estate. Otherwise, it’s a very similar phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtBg2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="moulua"&gt;Digital storefront Eneba is offering a sizable discount on a $100 Xbox gift card. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeDeals051921&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-live-100-usd-xbox-live-key-north-america%2Fprepaidforge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Go to this page&lt;/a&gt;, hit “Buy Now” and then enter the code &lt;strong&gt;XBOX100USD &lt;/strong&gt;to save around $13. If you don’t have Game Pass Ultimate and still prefer to buy games, or you want to gift this to someone else, this is a good value. This gift card can also be used to purchase downloadable content, and anything else available on the Microsoft Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rIoksR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10506009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrVL0B"&gt;The Asus Chromebook Flip C433 2-in-1 laptop is discounted at Best Buy. Originally $529, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740901014958165278#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s down to $329 today&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon currently lists this model for about $450. This isn’t one of the fastest Chromebook models currently available (it has an 8th Gen Intel Core m3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of somewhat sluggish eMMC storage), but it offers a few good features for the price. You’ll get a 14-inch 1080p display that can rotate to act more like a tablet, an SD card slot, and a backlit keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g65mCt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10506014"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="RMryri"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gI5wj6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google I/O 2021: rumors, news, and announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UaeGi9PiOzZH-wAmYDWUScXtBY=/428x0:1949x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304391/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_4.31.49_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The event kicks off at 1PM ET / 10AM PT today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="X700kQ"&gt;Since Google I/O was canceled completely last year due to COVID-19, this year’s festivities — which will be available online to anyone who wants to watch — are sure to be, well, festive. Today’s two-hour event will introduce what is expected to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435116/google-io-2021-rumors-android-12-pixel-buds-a-series-chip"&gt;full treasure chest of new hardware and software&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R583nc"&gt;Of course, nothing’s for sure when it comes to Google, but it’s very likely we’ll get some information about the latest version of its OS, Android 12. (There have already been some developer previews.) This could be very interesting since rumors have it that there are some major UI changes in the works. We’ll also be looking for the much-anticipated Pixel Buds A-series and a custom processor for Pixel phones. We might even get a preview of the Pixel 5A phone — and who knows? Google may have some other surprises planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlCEZQ"&gt;We’ll be watching live and keeping you updated here with everything Google announces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9rt2D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new iMac brings M1 goodness to the desktop</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A new design, new processor, and new screen make for a winning combination&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7EU4aE"&gt;This is an iMac unlike any other iMac we’ve seen before, and it all comes down to the M1 chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Vsjmw"&gt;Sure, there are some other differences between this 24-inch iMac and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18311920/apple-imac-27-21-5-2019-review-specs-features-price"&gt;21.5-inch model&lt;/a&gt; from 2019 that it’s replacing. There are better microphones and better speakers. There are fewer ports, and some of them have moved around. The screen is bigger and better. The keyboard now has TouchID. But the M1 is the star of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zrowl"&gt;It’s not just the performance increase. It’s not just the fact that you can run iOS and iPadOS apps natively on the system. It’s not just the new advanced image signal processor, which helps create better low-light images than I’ve ever seen from an integrated webcam. It’s also the groundbreaking efficiency with which this processor runs, which has enabled Apple to create a slim, sleek, and quite unique iMac chassis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oGUpSW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10505348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0fP9ib"&gt;Whether you actually get every upgrade here depends on the configuration you choose. The entry-level iMac is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-7-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,299&lt;/a&gt; for 256GB of SSD storage, two Thunderbolt / USB 4 ports, 8GB of unified memory, and a seven-core GPU — but that’s only available in four colors and doesn’t come with TouchID. The model I tested bumps the storage up to 512GB and the memory up to 16GB. It has two USB-3 ports in addition to the two Thunderbolt, an eight-core GPU, Touch ID, and a gigabit Ethernet port (which is in the power brick). I also received both the Magic Mouse and the Magic Trackpad with my model. You’d need to pay a total of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2Fblue-24-inch-apple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-512gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,028&lt;/a&gt; to get everything Apple sent me (and which I’ll be sending back, for the record). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaSzRz"&gt;In short, this device costs money. And it’s true that you’d get similar performance and save a few hundred bucks, if you just plugged a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; into an external display. But this iMac has almost everything that most people need in one package: processing power, sure, but also a camera, speakers, microphones, a keyboard, a mouse, a trackpad, and a display. And they’re all good. This is a computer you can plonk on your desk and never think about again. And for some of the iMac’s target audience, that’s probably worth the extra money. You’re paying for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UpRmCz9Ppj-0ehz9LDIpXBXeGCY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521222/akrales_20210515_4583_0105.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new iMac is completely redesigned, but instantly recognizable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7kPngM"&gt;The M1 processor uses what’s called a “hybrid” configuration. The easiest way to conceive of this is that most competing Intel and AMD chips have a number of equally “okay” cores, where Apple’s M1 has four very fast cores and four lower-powered high-efficiency cores. This allows M1 devices to deliver arguably the best performance-per-watt in the world. It also means that they’re nearly unbeatable in single-core workloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq56PF"&gt;That advantage bore out in our benchmark testing. This iMac model achieved a higher score on the Geekbench 5 single-core benchmark than &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks"&gt;any Mac&lt;/a&gt; we’ve ever seen before — even the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-pro-late-2017"&gt;iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt;. That means if you’re looking for a device for simpler everyday tasks that don’t scale to every available CPU core (and that largely seems to be the demographic that Apple is trying to sell this machine to), there has literally never been a better iMac for you to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LTQC7"&gt;You can see the rest of our benchmarks below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dwvoxG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10504220"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FbG1jZ"&gt;These results help illuminate where this iMac fits into Apple’s all-in-one lineup, and where its limitations are. The 24-incher is a significant improvement over the 21.5-inch &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/7833298"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; in both single-core and multi-core workloads. And it’s very comparable in &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2820056"&gt;graphics&lt;/a&gt; tasks — which is quite impressive, given that the 21.5-inch iMac has a discrete GPU and this one relies on what’s integrated with the M1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn3FMw"&gt;On the other end, these results (with the exception of single-core performance) are not close to what we’d expect from the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/2828013"&gt;27-inch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/imac-27-inch-retina-mid-2020-intel-core-i7-10700k-3-8-ghz-8-cores"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=38756"&gt;iMac&lt;/a&gt; with discrete graphics. In this comparison, multi-core results are more important. They indicate that the 27-inch iMac is going to do much better on the types of tasks that owners (or prospective buyers) are likely to be doing: intense multitasking, computations, design, video work, and other more complex loads that may leverage the GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59K7fR"&gt;There are other limitations that may put some workloads out of reach. As is the case with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and Mac Mini, you can’t configure the iMac with more than 16GB of memory and 2TB of storage; we wouldn’t recommend those specs to anyone who regularly edits 4K or 8K video, for example. The memory and storage are soldered, so you can’t upgrade them after purchase. Only one external display is supported (up to 6K resolution at 60Hz). Ports are also bizarrely limited; the base model has just two Thunderbolt / USB-4 ports and a headphone jack, while more expensive models have an additional two USB-3 ports and Gigabit Ethernet. These all may be reasons Apple is pushing this iMac as a “home and family” PC, even though its processor is clearly capable of all kinds of professional work.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRv0bG79h2KwzeQthF_qkXdCpR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521218/akrales_20210515_4583_0025.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M1 processor’s efficiency allows the iMac to get away with a thin design and minimal fan noise, and still maintain performance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvaSR"&gt; Another way to interpret these numbers is that I was getting effectively the same performance out of this machine as we got from the M1 MacBook Pro and the Mac Mini. That’s completely unsurprising, since these devices all use the same processor. But it’s a good proxy for gauging whether the iMac can handle your work: if you expect you could get a task done with the M1 MacBook Pro, you should be able to do it on this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LN8P9M"&gt;More anecdotally, I was able to use my test unit for all kinds of daily tasks, from emailing to YouTube to amateur photo and video work. I was able to hop between over 25 Chrome tabs with Cinebench looping in the background, with no stutter or slowdown whatsoever. If you’re buying the iMac for this kind of thing, I can’t imagine you’ll see too many spinning wheels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="q2t0Y1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The M1 processor in the iMac is just as capable as it is in the 13-inch MacBooks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6Pxe8"&gt;During this testing process, I also got a sense of just how well cooled this chassis is. On thinner laptops that I test often (including the fanless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll see performance decrease if you run heavy tasks over and over again. None of that on this iMac: I looped Cinebench R23 as well as a Premiere Pro 4K video export several times over and never saw scores go down. It took a lot to get the fans going — they were checked out during my daily office multitasking. When they did spin up, mostly while I was working in Premiere, I could barely hear them. They were quieter than the background hum of my refrigerator. That’s quite a quality-of-life improvement over prior Intel iMacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNPpjB"&gt;The M1’s advantage, after all, has never been raw power; it’s the combination of power and efficiency. We saw much better battery life in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro than we did in their Intel predecessors. Battery life obviously isn’t a concern with the iMac, but efficiency certainly is. Chips are limited by two things: the power available and how well their systems can keep them cool. They vent almost all the energy they use as heat, and because the M1 has such incredibly high performance per watt, Apple doesn’t need a heavy-duty cooling system to keep it from frying itself. Because it doesn’t need that heavy-duty cooling system, Apple has finally been able to redesign the iMac from the ground up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LGQelZSqyCDpUfFGJ6BVlQlIDfM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521208/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac’s chassis is so thin it looks like a big iPad minus the touchscreen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lgcBjS"&gt;This iMac is sleek. Even though it has a 24-inch screen, it’s close in size to its 21.5-inch predecessor. Apple reduced the screen’s borders by close to 50 percent in order to squeeze the bigger screen into the compact chassis. This device is also 11.5 millimeters thick, or just under half an inch — which is quite thin as all-in-ones go. Next to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356416/apple-imac-27-2020-review-price-specs-features"&gt;27-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like a tablet on a stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="GDimtP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10504858"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RZJbN7"&gt;Size isn’t everything; this iMac also comes in seven colors. There’s blue, green, pink, orange, purple, yellow, and the boring silver we know and love. I’m not quite convinced that the jazzier models will fit in outside of especially stylish homes and offices. But I will say: I’ve never seen so many of my friends, or so many people on TikTok, as excited about a tech product as they seem to be about the colored iMacs. The hues are a nice change, aren’t obnoxious, and are clearly a hit with certain crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzqNj3"&gt;Some traditional iMac touches remain, of course. The bezels are still substantial compared to those of some modern monitors. You can’t raise or lower the display height — the built-in stand only allows tilt adjustments. (You can also buy it with a built-in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac-vesa&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;VESA mount adapter&lt;/a&gt;.) And there’s still that pesky chin, though it’s no longer emblazoned with the Apple logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oKs4o"&gt;Pretty much every other notable part of the iMac has been upgraded in some way. There’s a 4.5K (4480 x 2520) Retina display, a step up from the predecessor’s 4096 x 2304 Retina display (though both have effectively the same pixel density). It has Apple’s True Tone technology, which automatically adjusts colors and intensity based on your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItlCCp"&gt;But the screen is also another reminder that this iMac doesn’t have “Pro” in its name. Twenty-four inches is on the small side as screens go; most of the best external monitors are 27 inches or larger these days. Professionals on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s video team also noticed some vignetting on the sides of the screen, which caused issues with off-angle viewing — we had a similar issue with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;Apple’s Pro Display XDR&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, neither of these limitations were a problem for my untrained eye; I thought the display looked great, with sharp details and plenty of room for my Chrome tabs and apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKKf6W"&gt;Elsewhere, Apple has upgraded the camera, microphones, and speakers. The company claims that they’re the best camera, mic system, and speaker system that have ever appeared in a Mac. I’d believe it. The six-speaker sound system is easily on par with a good external speaker. I played some music in my kitchen, and it was audible all over the house. Percussion and bass were strong, and I felt very immersed in the songs. It also supports spatial audio when playing video with Dolby Atmos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qp3b33TMcZEmd5-C2seVP4Wty3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521223/akrales_20210515_4583_0124.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new camera has a higher resolution and better picture quality for video calls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ix620TvXHoYLTIl9WeXC74U8M1U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521220/akrales_20210515_4583_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are just two or four USB-C ports on the new iMac, depending on configuration. You’re going to need dongles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oH20BeeAQlaYGNfKBIlqRKgsF7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521210/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0029.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The power adapter is now external, like a MacBook, but it conveniently includes an Ethernet port&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHanB4"&gt;I don’t have too much to say about the three-mic array except that nobody on my Zoom calls had any trouble hearing me. But the webcam was a very pleasant surprise. The iMac has a 1080p FaceTime HD camera, which has a higher resolution than the 720p shooter that lives in the 21.5-inch iMac (as well as the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, and many other AIOs). The M1 also lends a hand here: its built-in image signal processor and neural engines help optimize your picture in low-light settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkDq3B"&gt;I wouldn’t say I looked &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; on my Zoom calls — parts of my background were sometimes washed out, and the image looked processed in some dimmer areas. But I was visible and clear, which is better than you get from most webcams these days. And the difference between this webcam and the grainy mess the MacBook Pro has is night and day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LEFbdsaGxN98UQu-vdJOMEUUbUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521209/bfarsace_20210514_4583_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iMac is the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="aIC4vt"&gt;When I review a computer, my task is usually to figure out for whom that computer is made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1SSY8"&gt;But all kinds of people use iMacs, from college students to accountants to podcast producers to retired grandparents. And this model has arguably the most widespread consumer appeal of any iMac that Apple has made in recent years. So it’s much easier to figure out for whom this iMac &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1duJQ"&gt;It’s not for people who can’t handle dongles and docks; I kept a USB-C to USB-A dongle next to me on my desk while I was testing the iMac, and I used it &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;frequently. It’s not for people who already own a 27-inch iMac, because it would be a downgrade in display size and quality, port selection, upgradability, and raw power. And it’s not for people with serious performance needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jNnmQ"&gt;It’s not for people who are looking for the very best value for their money. Most folks won’t need the specs and accessories that I tested here, but even $1,299, the base price, is certainly more than plenty of people want to spend on a computer. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini%2Fapple-m1-chip-with-8-core-cpu-and-8-core-gpu-256gb%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22440059%2Fapple-imac-m1-2021-24-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; is $600 cheaper than the base iMac; plug that into a monitor and some speakers (you can find plenty of good ones for well under $600), and you’ll get the same M1 performance at a massive discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="baWViv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re paying for the iMac’s simplicity&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5Uui4"&gt;And that, right there, is the biggest reason that this iMac, despite its power, is primarily targeting the family market. Because it’s asking you to pay more in order to do less. You’re paying $600 not to have to research and budget out monitors, speakers, webcams, docks, keyboards, and mice. You’re paying not to have to arrange thousands of things on your desk. You’re paying for a device where everything, out of the box, works well. You’re paying to eliminate fuss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPGV2A"&gt;Tech enthusiasts (especially those who want to pop their machines open and make their own upgrades) may see that as a waste of money. And for them, it probably is. But they’re not the target audience for this Mac — even if its specs might suit their needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="STI36u"&gt;Could Apple have done more with this iMac? Of course. I was hoping to see a 30-inch, 6K iMac with a powerhouse 12-core workstation chip this month as much as the next person. But I have faith that we’ll get one in the future — and in the meantime, I’m glad Apple released this. It’s not earth-shattering in its design; it doesn’t redefine its category. But it’s fun. It improves upon the 21.5-inch iMac to offer a simple, attractive, and very functional device for users across all kinds of categories. It’s not the iMac to beat — but it is the iMac for most people to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B2un5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2jyVK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Echo Frames can now come with sunglass or blue light filtering lenses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym3i-_tLuZPCyPHp_hSXc7OBtiQ=/0x0:8688x5792/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304369/Echo_Frames_Classic_Sunglass_Lens.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with Classic sunglass lenses.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T1qTQH"&gt;Amazon is launching new lens options today for its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Frames/dp/B083C58VDP/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+frames&amp;amp;qid=1621342532&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt; smart audio glasses: two types of polarized sunglass lenses for use outside, and blue light-filtering lenses for staring at bright screens. The blue mirror sunglass options will ship on May 18th, and the “Classic” dark sunglass lenses and blue light filtering lenses will arrive later on June 9th. All three varieties will be available in the black version of the Echo Frames for $269.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVgx5h"&gt;Echo Frames are far simpler in comparison to other smart glasses, like Google Glass. Essentially, they’re a glasses frame with Amazon’s Alexa assistant built-in, along with some microphones and downward firing speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;In our review of the Frames&lt;/a&gt;, we found Alexa’s abilities to be pretty limited (especially on the iPhone) because the assistant defaults to Amazon’s services. Frames are much more compelling as a straightforward audio device, which is where these new lens options seem to come in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jYR1eIA1QcSaumJCXHZ0dv-3B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521560/Echo_Frames_Blue_Light_Filtering_Home.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with blue light filtering lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X8oOK6"&gt;Take the sunglasses variety. Echo Frames might not make sense as a smart assistant you interact with all day, but for a bike ride or hike, it could be very helpful to have your sunglasses pull double duty as headphones for music or podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEigYH"&gt;You could use the same kind of logic for the blue light-filtering lenses. Say you’re going heads down on a long project and you know you’re going to look at screens for an extended period of time. Having a way to listen to music or take calls while still keeping your ears free could be handy. (Keep in mind blue light &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/17/17724658/screen-time-blue-light-blindness-science"&gt;might not be as damaging or eye-straining&lt;/a&gt; as some headlines suggest.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jKWaqYtOJ3-_Cs52b4_SfsaT3Yk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22521578/Echo_Frames_Blue_Mirrorr_Sunglass_Lens_Dog_Park.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo Frames with mirror blue sunglass lenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lEN9sF"&gt;The limit on either of these use cases is the battery life of the Echo Frames. When we originally reviewed the Frames we weren’t able to make it through a full day, despite Amazon’s more open-ended battery life claim of 14 hours of “mixed use.” For an afternoon outdoors, it seems like the sunglasses should last, but using blue light glasses inside, listening to music all day, you might have to keep a closer eye on the Frames’ battery. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EuW3H4"&gt;Even though the iPhone arrived as a harbinger of doom for phones with physical keyboards well over a decade ago, the fanatical enthusiasm for BlackBerry isn’t something that just goes away completely. People loved their BlackBerry keyboards, and their relative efficiency when compared to touchscreens wasn’t really the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApvQN"&gt;Still, the niche gets tinier by the year, and it falls on similarly tiny companies to serve it. Now we have the Titan Pocket, a new Android phone launching today &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;on Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; from Unihertz, which previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332385/jelly-2-phone-size-screen-kickstarter-price-specs-features"&gt;miniature Jelly phones&lt;/a&gt; and, more pertinently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20826305/unihertz-titan-phone-keyboard-hands-on-kickstarter-specs-price-features"&gt;another BlackBerry-esque device called the Titan&lt;/a&gt; back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDQl9C"&gt;The Titan was like a rugged take on the BlackBerry Passport, which was a weird phone even for BlackBerry fans. Its sibling, the Pocket, keeps the rugged style but comes in much more manageable dimensions. The 3.1-inch LCD screen is actually a little smaller than a BlackBerry Classic’s, though it has a similar resolution at 716 x 720, which makes for a fairly sharp pixel density of 328 ppi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XBpKRDDFEQI2oCJ2f11S3ryzRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522380/IMG_20210518_162324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket is a lot more rugged than the average BlackBerry.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BgELwz"&gt;Obviously, you can’t fit all that much content on a screen like this. The Gmail app only shows three emails at once, for example. But if you’re longing for the days of firing out email blasts on your Blackberry, well, the Titan Pocket shows about as much of your message as any other smartphone would when bringing up a touchscreen keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0u9iY"&gt;I was never a BlackBerry addict myself, so those who were may feel differently, but I think the Titan Pocket’s keyboard is pretty good. I’m way faster on a touchscreen, of course, but the keys are responsive and easy to distinguish, and the backlighting looks much better than it did on the bigger Titan. The Pocket delivers on its promise of a satisfyingly tactile typing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z7Cd2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tUh5H6"&gt;Unfortunately, the keyboard doesn’t do much more than that. The Pocket runs a basically stock version of Android 11 that hasn’t been customized much for its form factor. There aren’t the same kind of keyboard shortcuts that BlackBerry users were used to. Pressing or holding down a letter key on the home screen just starts typing in a Google search, for example. This would still be a useful feature if not for the fact that the cursor appears in the search bar behind the first letter you typed, making it essentially useless since you’ll have to fix a typo on every single search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCAPwV"&gt;And as with the larger Titan, you’ll find many examples of how Android apps don’t really know how to deal with square screens. Games are mostly out, and fullscreen video usually only plays on its side. (Then again, I suppose the BlackBerry Bold wasn’t exactly an incredible entertainment device itself.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fY84pp"&gt;Accordingly, the Titan Pocket is not a powerful phone. It has a MediaTek P70 processor, 6GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage; you’ll sometimes see some lag when scrolling through Twitter and so on, but generally performance seems adequate for the kind of thing you’ll be doing on a phone like this. Other features include a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJSbGO"&gt;The standout spec is the 4,000mAh battery, which is no doubt helped by the sturdy, 16.8mm-thick design and should give the phone some pretty serious endurance considering the small screen and low-power processor. This phone’s vibe is decidedly less C-suite than an actual BlackBerry, but if you need to send emails while hiking, it could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oEF6k_lvl3malWN2WedCaY8DLfo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522379/ptp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Titan Pocket doesn’t do a great job with moving subjects or low-light conditions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7UlRgl"&gt;As long as you don’t also need to take stunning photos on the hike, that is, because the Titan Pocket’s single 16-megapixel camera predictably isn’t very good. It should do a reasonable job in bright conditions, like just about anything else, but the square-by-default results aren’t great for low light or moving subjects. Like my dog most of the time, as you can see above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DcPZb"&gt;But hey, this is a niche device at a pretty low price. Its camera might be worse than most other phones out there, but its physical keyboard is better than all other phones out there by virtue of existing at all. Its &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jellyphone/titan-pocket-the-smallest-qwerty-android-11-smartphone"&gt;Kickstarter pricing&lt;/a&gt; starts at $159 and goes up to $219, making it a potentially viable option as a second device despite its obvious limitations. Unihertz has a good record shipping crowdfunded phones, and while this one doesn’t do much for me personally, I can imagine it might for others.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the Google I/O 2021 keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHuXvysAobj2ti9IPXs5B983X74=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69304026/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkiYtY"&gt;It’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;over a year since Google last held I/O&lt;/a&gt; thanks to the pandemic, but with the COVID-19 outlook slightly more positive in 2021, the company is making its triumphant return to the (virtual) stage with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371782/google-io-2021-date-announcement-virtual-online-event-date-android"&gt;an entirely online Google I/O developer conference&lt;/a&gt;. And with a year and some change between I/O 2019 and now, there’s plenty of room for&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435116/google-io-2021-rumors-android-12-pixel-buds-a-series-chip"&gt; interesting announcements&lt;/a&gt; when everything kicks off at 10AM PT (1PM ET) today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKyr1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is expected to make its official debut, with rumors swirling that the new update will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;shake up the visual style&lt;/a&gt; of the mobile operating system, among other improvements. We’re also hoping to hear more about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419835/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet-photo"&gt;a less expensive version of the Pixel Buds&lt;/a&gt; and maybe more information about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;the Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt;, after both products leaked in the lead-up to the event. There’s also a good chance there’ll be improvements to Google Assistant and possibly an introduction to the custom system on a chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;Whitechapel&lt;/a&gt; that Google is rumored to be developing to compete with Apple’s A-series chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ibJn9"&gt;To stay on top of I/O’s exciting news, we’ve got all the ways you can watch and read alongside us below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IzLx24"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE GOOGLE I/O 2021 KEYNOTE?&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Gogoro is joining the battery swapping revolution in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P3fEbH4blPZzcgyinmZoiv6VBpk=/0x83:1981x1404/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303868/Gogoro_Swap_Guy_L.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="io8EKq"&gt;Electric scooter company Gogoro continues to expand outside its home country of Taiwan in a big way, as it just announced new partnerships with a pair of China’s leading two-wheel manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="md8Jjw"&gt;DCJ, the top gas-powered motorcycle company in China, and Yadea, one of the biggest makers of electric scooters, motorcycles, bikes and mopeds, have each agreed to develop new two-wheelers that will use Gogoro’s swappable batteries and electric drivetrains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvZIOm"&gt;Gogoro CEO Horace Luke tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;the deals with DCJ and Yadea have been in the works for around two years and that the Chinese companies dug deep into Gogoro’s technology before deciding to partner up. The three companies are announcing the deals just as the Chinese government has begun to embrace battery swapping in a big way, like adopting a national standard for the &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/china-ev-swappable-battery-standards-approved/"&gt;tech in larger passenger vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRKRtC"&gt;To that end, DCJ and Yadea will deploy networks of Gogoro’s vending machine-sized battery swapping stations, starting in Hangzhou, as they work on new vehicles built on the Taiwanese startup’s tech. Gogoro’s battery swap stations can also help a local electric grid meet moments of high demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qomgGH"&gt;“We are on the path to make Gogoro’s standard the de facto standard with the intention of making these cities cleaner, better, and safer for all of us in the future,” Luke says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqdGXl"&gt;The announcement comes just a few weeks after Gogoro revealed that it’s entering the Indian market by way of a partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394575/gogoro-india-hero-motorcorp-electric-scooters-battery-swap-stations"&gt;that country’s leading two-wheel manufacturer, Hero MotorCorp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDVvQi"&gt;But while Gogoro will be working with Hero to essentially create the market for electric scooters in India, China presents the opposite opportunity. It’s the biggest market for electric two-wheelers in the world, but many of those scooters are using older battery technology that is a pain to charge and bad for the environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZNyhf"&gt;“China is completely the reverse, [where] a majority of the two-wheelers on the road today are electric. However, they’re shitty electric. The scooters are using lead-acid batteries that are clunky, [and] they don’t last very long,” Luke says. “When they use lithium battery, you [have to] carry the lithium ion battery back home to charge, it’s unsafe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwafCv"&gt;Gogoro’s batteries, meanwhile, are compact but energy dense, and can be easily popped in and out of the battery swapping stations. Luke says they’re extremely durable, too, claiming that the very first ones that Gogoro released into the wild are still being swapped in Taiwan today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtj33G"&gt;Terms of the deals were not disclosed, but expanding into China is a massive step for Gogoro, which came out of stealth mode in 2015 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7484171/gogoro-smartscooter-electric-scooter-removeable-battery"&gt;at the Consumer Electronics Show&lt;/a&gt;. In the years since that debut, Gogoro has built out a massive network of scooters and battery-swapping stations across Taiwan, but Luke now refers to that as a “trial” ahead of these much larger partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Who needs Super Nintendo World when an English town looks like this?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFt_gfrGvDacVaDDnN_VVDp7TL8=/0x0:615x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69303826/0_updated_plant_p_678004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anita Maric / SWNS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsRARN"&gt;In March this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;Nintendo opened its Super Nintendo World theme park&lt;/a&gt; in Osaka, Japan. Now, just a few short months later, the &lt;a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/council-under-fire-over-leaving-20596223"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that over a dozen giant green plant pots have been installed in Walsall, UK’s town center, prompting immediate comparisons to the Super Mario franchise. I’m not saying the two events are related, but the dots connect themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soaadV"&gt;“It makes the place [look] more like something from Super Mario Brothers,” florist Andrea Loveridge told the &lt;em&gt;Mail&lt;/em&gt;. “They look like those warp pipes Mario jumps down.” This is apparently a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qotxlt"&gt;According to local councillor Adrian Andrew, the pots are part of improvement works designed to “promote a feeling of wellbeing and safety and enhance the town centre environment.” He added that “a key element of this work was to introduce more planting into the town centre to create a more social space outside the Walsall Art Gallery.” Naturally, the warp pipes will also serve the immediate transportation needs of local Italian plumbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xyjYrL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Council under fire over leaving town centre looking 'like something from Super Mario Brothers' &lt;a href="https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9"&gt;https://t.co/FXFjEPFFU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Birmingham Live (@birmingham_live) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/birmingham_live/status/1393141590819065861?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rb1QIn"&gt;“The colour is vile, they are a garish eyesore and a complete waste of taxpayer’s money,” resident Joanna Parrish told the &lt;em&gt;Birmingham Mail&lt;/em&gt;, while supermarket worker Sue Morrisson added that “they would look ok in a vibrant, modern town but in a dilapidated and tired looking town like Walsall, they just stand out like a sore thumb.” Critics also raised concerns about the cost of the pots, at a time when the council is having to slash millions from its budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znRH8g"&gt;Personally, I appreciate that a town is willing to take a punt on a weird bit of street furniture when so many are made up of the same identical collection of chain stores. Then again, I’m not the one who has to look at them every time I leave the house to buy a sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZJlyW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7UWXi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
