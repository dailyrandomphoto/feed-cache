    <title>Samsung is bringing digital car keys to its phones, starting in South Korea</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w19mFK"&gt;After announcing plans &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230960/samsung-digital-car-key-audi-bmw-ford-genesis-uwb-bluetooth"&gt;for digital car keys in its phones&lt;/a&gt; during the Galaxy S21 launch, Samsung is finally starting to &lt;a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/pressreleases/unlock-a-new-experience-galaxy-users-can-now-use-secure-digital-car-key-with-genesis-gv60"&gt;add support for the feature&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung says support for the ultra wideband (UWB) and NFC-enabled digital car keys will hit South Korea first, and it will only work with one car to start — &lt;a href="https://www.genesis.com/worldwide/en/models/luxury-suv-genesis/gv60/highlights.html"&gt;the all-electric Genesis GV60&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW1qhN"&gt;On devices that support UWB — the Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus and Ultra, Note 20 Ultra, and Galaxy Z Fold 2 and 3 — Samsung promises “passive entry,” meaning you can unlock and lock your car without pulling your phone out of your bag or pocket. With your phone nearby, you’ll also be able to start your car and make adjustments to mirrors, seats, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQZydkuorE6iZ5Er70COiC6ojs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890971/001_genesis_samsung_digital_key.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How keys for the Genesis GV60 will appear on Samsung’s phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EAmmYS"&gt;The digital keys are stored in Samsung Pass — and protected by an “embedded Secure Element (eSE)” —  and, according to Samsung, can be shared with anyone running Android 11 with its app downloaded. That amounts to accessing one type of car in one region right now, but Samsung has partnerships with Audi, BMW, and Ford. Hopefully, those carmakers will add support soon now that Genesis has broken the seal. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Samsung for details on when more cars and regions will be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9YryH"&gt;Also, since Samsung is supporting NFC for keys, older Galaxy phones running Android 11 should be able to get into the fun. Samsung now uses UWB and NFC for two headlining features on its phones: these digital car keys and finding items with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;the Galaxy SmartTag it announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. That brings it in parallel with Apple, which introduced digital car keys enabled by the U1 chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;alongside iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021) review: cut by the Blade</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is still great, but it’s no longer on top&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AM7TxH"&gt;Asus has refreshed its blockbuster, category-defining Zephyrus G14, a gaming laptop that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;so successful last year&lt;/a&gt; that it was basically impossible to buy in the months following its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4cydi"&gt;As was probably wise, the company has made very few changes to last year’s product. The 2021 Zephyrus G14 has last year’s chassis with new chips (AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile processors and Nvidia’s RTX 3000 mobile GPUs). There are also new display options: last year’s model had a 1080p 120Hz panel or a 1440p 60Hz panel, while this year’s offers the choice of a QHD 120Hz screen or a 1080p 144Hz screen, in addition to a 1080p 60Hz option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5omkns"&gt;Those updates put the G14 a bit closer to the premium category than it was last year, and the price reflects that — the entry-level RTX configuration, which was $1,499 last year, has been bumped up to $1,549. That’s still decent value, but it’s no longer the rarity that it was in last year’s market. The competition has gotten more powerful, and it’s not too much more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Republic of Gamers nameplate on the lid of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k6n_elcCEoFoGxxFhk6q0l1Ckec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804778/akrales_210824_4724_0120.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We meet again, Zephyrus G14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jMlGyh"&gt;All 2021 Zephyrus G14 models have AMD’s Ryzen 5000 series processors. The top option is the eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HS. This is more efficient than other chips in the Ryzen 9 series (such as the 5900HX, which powers the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;Razer Blade 14&lt;/a&gt;), but it still packs some serious power. My test unit paired this chip with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060, as well as 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and the QHD 120Hz display. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are a trend that’s exploded this year, in part because Ryzen 5000 and RTX 3000 chips have finally made QHD gaming a reasonable possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="I5QTAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10782239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the ROG Zephyrus G14 seen from the side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bkvI-sxWe-EQs_24S0-v7FI8tVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804774/akrales_210824_4724_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is legitimately my favorite keyboard on any laptop ever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m5FxvC"&gt;This configuration is listed for $1,999.99 on &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-series/spec"&gt;Asus’ website&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s sold out there as of this writing), and it’s pretty much the top model you can buy. The &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g14-aw-se-series/spec"&gt;other $1,999.99 model&lt;/a&gt; is one that Asus developed with DJ Alan Walker, which comes with fancy packaging that can function as a DJ deck. It’s a bit specced down, though, including just an RTX 3050 Ti and 16GB of RAM. (We &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629096/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-alan-walker-edition-dj-deck-gaming-laptop"&gt;reviewed that device separately&lt;/a&gt; — it’s cool, but mostly cool for Alan Walker fans.) Both of these models also include the AniMe Matrix, a fancy grid of LEDs on the G14’s lid that can form cool animated designs if you’re so inclined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MLr3X"&gt;Those are the only two configurations currently listed on Asus’ website. I’ve also been able to find a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWIbcuxZB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,549.99 model&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy that includes the RTX 3060, 16GB of RAM, and the 144Hz 1080p display (which is likely better value than my test unit), as well as &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWJxeLuhV#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $1,149.99 model&lt;/a&gt; with a 60Hz display, a Ryzen 7 5800HS, and a GeForce GTX 1650. &lt;a href="https://www.excaliberpc.com/768172/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-ga401qm-211.zg14b.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Excalibur PC&lt;/a&gt; also has an RTX 3060 / QHD / 16GB / 1TB model for $1,799.99. None of these include the AniMe Matrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 seen from above, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3xVAna_dNAZV8MA_PK9beopPink=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804772/akrales_210824_4724_0030.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our test configuration is pricey for its specs, but some of Best Buy’s options are more reasonable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ghNhSQ"&gt;The biggest thing to take away from all this is that the G14 has a ceiling — the RTX 3060 and the Ryzen 9 5900HS are the best you can get. Last year, that combination would’ve made it the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop in the world. But there’s a reason that’s not the case anymore, and it’s called the Razer Blade 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mvbv7m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The G14 has a ceiling&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zptUJj"&gt;The Zephyrus averaged 191fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;at native resolution and 263fps in 1080p. Dust particles, fires, clouds, and other intense effects were no problem. It averaged 33fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;with all sliders maxed at 1440p, 40fps on the Ultra preset, and 51fps on the Ultra preset in 1080p. (DLSS wasn’t super effective in this game, oddly — I only saw 42fps on the Ultra preset at 1440p with the feature set to “quality.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E7CFGO"&gt;Where the RTX 3060 really struggled was ray tracing in &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;. The G14 averaged 28fps on the highest preset with the feature set to Ultra (DLSS was helpful here, bumping that average up to 42fps). It did much better with ray tracing off, averaging 57fps at native resolution and 83fps in 1080p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g80R7CjJ21qt0V2cRwyI9s0284s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804775/akrales_210824_4724_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power port, HDMI, USB-C, headphone jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ports on the right side of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hj4uOQ8hzgrTShxHsBTsPjy-wLE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804773/akrales_210824_4724_0047.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lock slot, two USB-A, one USB-C on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rOTNSn"&gt;Right off the bat, these results are a sizable step up from last year’s G14; this model’s beating it on all three titles in 1080p. However, it still can’t quite run all of these games at playable frame rates in QHD unless you bump some settings down (though it can certainly take full advantage of its 120Hz display with esports fodder like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPwL5z"&gt;The more demanding titles are where the performance gap between the RTX 3060 and the RTX 3070 really becomes apparent. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor and a 3070 crushed the G14 on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;(averaging 58fps) and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider &lt;/em&gt;(61fps with ray tracing on, 81fps with ray tracing off) in 1440p. That model is actually &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGWK2rjb4O#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 cheaper&lt;/a&gt; than my G14 unit — it doesn’t include the AniMe Matrix and only has 16GB of RAM. The G15 also comes with &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/laptops/rog-zephyrus/2021-rog-zephyrus-g15-series/spec" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; (with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage), for an even cheaper $1,499.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ne1ZoN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Where the RTX 3060 really struggled was ray tracing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eyk3SX"&gt;The Razer Blade 14 I tested had an RTX 3070 as well as a Ryzen 9 5900HX, in a chassis that’s actually a little bit smaller than the G14’s. It also gave the Zephyrus a run for its money on both &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; (averaging 58fps and 51fps in QHD, respectively). An RTX 3070 Blade 14 is more expensive than this G14 model (&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-14-%2FRZ09-0370BEA3-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,199.99 as of this writing&lt;/a&gt;) and only has 16GB of RAM, but still offers a lot for that price — you get not only the extra power, but also a 165Hz QHD screen, an RGB keyboard, and a webcam. The G14 doesn’t even have a great cost argument against the Blade 14 if you want to stick with the RTX 3060, because you can also buy the latter with an RTX 3060 and a 144Hz display &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-blade-14-14-gaming-laptop-fhd-144hz-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-16gb-ram-1tb-ssd-black%2F6472588.p%3FskuId%3D6472588&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; ($200 less than my test model). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="2do5E3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10782255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPAl0c"&gt;One final thing to note on gaming — this thing gets hot. While I didn’t see evidence of throttling necessarily, the 5900HS was consistently in the high 80s (Celsius) or low 90s during gameplay. (On the bigger G15, for context, the same chip ran through all the same titles without jumping above 80.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cfy9bo"&gt;The G14’s case also got very, very hot during gameplay. The keyboard was uncomfortable to touch, and the bottom was blistering. If I held my hand right above the keys, I could feel the heat. This wasn’t too far from the experience I had with last year’s G14, but the Blade 14 did a better job with even more powerful components. While it had some trouble keeping its chip cool, the heat didn’t transfer to the outside of its chassis in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh2XWT"&gt;The fans were also loud during gameplay, though you can switch to a “Silent” profile in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. I used this while doing regular office work with the G14, and it did live up to its name while keeping the keyboard cool (though the bottom of the chassis was still toasty most of the time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ufI71i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard was uncomfortable to touch, and the bottom was blistering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52IA8p"&gt;So what does the 2021 G14 have going for it? Pretty much everything else. The display is crisp and vivid, maxing out at 300 nits and covering 100 percent of the sRGB gamut, 87 percent of AdobeRGB, and 99 percent of P3. The speakers — including two downward-firing woofers and two tweeters, deliver clear audio with resonant bass and forceful percussion. The G14 comes preloaded with Dolby Access, including audio presets for games, music, movies, and voice. (The Music profile makes vocals clearer, while the Music and Game presets give the backing tracks more oomf.) The microphones had no trouble picking up my voice on work calls, even with some background noise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus logo on the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqnEkOy3T2glOGQoOxmlopOluJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804777/akrales_210824_4724_0113.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a nice, subdued design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The top corner of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ihLIE-w4waUfNcXp4iKk-u1RaUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804779/akrales_210824_4724_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not quite as beautiful as the Blade, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJpx1w"&gt;The chassis is thin, light, and sturdy, and the ErgoLift hinge, an Asus staple that folds under the deck and lifts the keyboard slightly off the ground, isn’t as sharp in your lap as it is on some other Asus laptops. And the G14’s keyboard and touchpad are some of my favorites — not just among gaming laptops but among all laptops on the market. The keys are backlit, quiet, and comfortable, with plenty of travel and a satisfying click — I especially appreciate the dedicated volume keys at the top of the deck. The trackpad is quite smooth, with one of the easiest clicks you’ll find on a laptop. I didn’t see any palm rejection issues and could generally scroll without hitting plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4gQvGs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The display is crisp and vivid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SwC7MM"&gt;Finally, battery life is an area where the G14 solidly beats the Blade 14. That’s to be expected, given the former’s more efficient processor. Using the G14 as my daily driver with an office workload, I averaged nine hours and 38 minutes. (This was with Battery Saver on, the screen around 200 nits, and the GPU disabled.) That’s longer than I saw from last year’s G14 as well as this year’s G15, and it makes this model one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops I’ve ever tested. The Blade averaged just six hours and 12 minutes from the same workload.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7ggj4"&gt;Battery gaming was also a decent experience. I got an hour and two minutes of &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; gameplay on the Ultra preset; the game was playable for 57 minutes of that time and dropped to stuttery frame rates after that (with around 10 percent remaining). The 180-watt charger is decently fast, though not exceptionally so. It took 50 minutes to juice the G14 up to 60 percent during light Chrome use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Zephyrus G14 open on a table seen from above. The screen displays the ROG logo on a black and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBlpY7JcOAdLq-B6PXfSaYPo7YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804770/akrales_210824_4724_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This model is white, so no fingerprint problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="av0Olw"&gt;There are only two real issues with the chassis. First, the fingerprint sensor on my unit was finicky and failed to recognize me about a third of the time. I’ve asked Asus whether this is an issue they’ve encountered before. The second is that there’s no webcam. One of the benefits of a thin and light device like the G14 is that it’s supposed to make for a great multipurpose driver, which is a significantly taller order when it can’t do video calls. Yes, you can plug in an external camera, but that’s a whole extra thing, and it’s especially annoying if you’re carrying the G14 around a lot. Asus really should just stick a webcam on this thing, even a lousy one, especially since its competitors have them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uyF5w6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10782277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CoJqQR"&gt;At the end of the day, the G14 is still excellent. It’s a good performer in a good chassis, with a keyboard, touchpad, speaker system, and battery life span that are absolute standouts. (Seriously — I apologize to whatever keyboard I have to review after this one, because it’s probably going to look bad in comparison.) And the new chips have delivered a marked improvement over last year’s G14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jftia3"&gt;Unfortunately, while this laptop hasn’t changed that much, its competition has. The G14 is no longer the most powerful 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy — and while its battery life in particular may still make it a great buy for some users, it’s no longer the obvious choice for everyone. The Blade 14 offers significantly more powerful chips in a chassis that’s thinner and almost as light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWU2c2"&gt;And while the Blade 14 is more expensive, there are also a number of ways to get an RTX 3070 for a lower price than the G14 is asking here. If you’re willing to go for something slightly bigger and miss out on the fancy lights, the Zephyrus G15 will give this exact chassis design (with the same exceptional keyboard, touchpad, audio, and battery life) with much better gaming results for less money. If you still want fancy lights, you can also get a 5900HX and an RTX 3070 (along with a 144Hz display) in the RGB-packed &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-ROG-Strix-G513-R9-Gaming-Laptop-15-6-FHD-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900HX-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3060-16GB-RAM-1TB-SSD-Eclipse-Gray-Windows-10-Home-G513QM-WS96%2F414650603&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROG Strix G15&lt;/a&gt; at a lower price than my test unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qdL8c4"&gt;Again, the G14 is still excellent. But there’s more excellent stuff in this category now than there was last year. The G14 has moved out of “slam-dunk” territory and into “good option for people who want a specific combination of things” territory. Which is, to be fair, where almost all gaming laptops live. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Bitcoin’s pollution could grow after leaving China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Russia’s Largest Bitcoin Mine Turns Water Into Cash" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCa_xOHTYdbAScNyS38gBbzJsSg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932481/1184520897.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Cryptocurrency mining rigs sit on three-storeys of racks inside the BitRiver Rus LLC cryptocurrency mining farm in Bratsk, Russia, on Friday, Nov. 8, 2019. | Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bW5xpD"&gt;China is cracking down on Bitcoin mining, and some experts fear that the cryptocurrency’s environmental footprint could become dirtier as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCeD2T"&gt;Bitcoin is incredibly energy hungry. To create new coins, miners race to solve complex puzzles using specialized machines. As a result, Bitcoin is &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; to use as much electricity annually as the entire country of Poland. Until this year, a majority of that electricity came from a mix of coal and hydropower in China. Last week, China sounded the death knell for Bitcoin mining within its borders when it made all cryptocurrency transactions and mining illegal — although most mining operations fled earlier in the year when bans were announced in provinces where most had previously set up shop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVjF4H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Emissions used to follow the ebb and flow of China’s dry and wet seasons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHsvBE"&gt;The proportion of miners still left in China is now close to zero, says Michel Rauchs, a research affiliate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. That has big implications for Bitcoin’s carbon footprint because emissions used to follow the ebb and flow of China’s dry and wet seasons. Miners took advantage of excess hydropower in China’s Sichuan province during the wet season each year, taking advantage of cheap, carbon-free energy. When that dried up, they moved north to Xinjiang province, where coal primarily powered their puzzle-solving. Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel, emitting more carbon dioxide when burned than oil and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnDyPq"&gt;Now, “both of these sources for Bitcoin mining have been basically eliminated,” says Susanne Köhler, a PhD fellow at Denmark’s Aalborg University who published a 2019 paper on Bitcoin’s impact on the environment. Both Köhler and Rauchs are still unsure about what that means for Bitcoin’s carbon emissions moving forward. It’ll depend on whether miners find another source of abundant clean energy like hydropower, turn to coal, or go with natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QX2Clq"&gt;But there’s a good chance Bitcoin is getting dirtier, says economist Alex de Vries, who has published research on Bitcoin’s pollution and e-waste. “Instead of using coal for just part of the year, they might be running on coal or natural gas all year long, and that’s definitely not going to have a positive impact,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dXGE4A"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Now the US seems to have become the largest mining center”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WgD3I"&gt;Three countries are emerging as the new hotspots for Bitcoin mining, according to Cambridge’s Rauchs. “Now, the US seems to have become the largest mining center,” he says, based on preliminary data that Cambridge plans to release in coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBLL6L"&gt;As Bitcoin miners flocked to the US earlier this year, they cozied up with coal and natural gas. The cryptocurrency revived a natural gas plant in Dresden, New York, that had previously stopped generating power for the public &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/bitcoin-greenidge-seneca-lake-cryptocurrency/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/fossil-fuel-firms-friends-bitcoin-100033926.html"&gt;Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;, a Bitcoin mining company is burning up waste coal to power up its machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5Navo"&gt;Bitcoin’s exorbitant energy has been getting more scrutiny as more governments set carbon-cutting goals. China, currently the world’s biggest greenhouse gas polluter, is committed to bringing its emissions down to net zero by 2060. That was &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ndrc.gov.cn/xxgk/zcfb/tz/202109/t20210924_1297474.html?code%3D%26state%3D123&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1633026603470000&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw15VnuuT595-LBdBuTwbUnC"&gt;one reason the country gave&lt;/a&gt; for its crackdown on cryptocurrencies, although the move also helped pave the way for China’s own forthcoming digital currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c16kA4"&gt;Even if cryptocurrency operations decide to shift to more renewable energy sources to make themselves more palatable to climate-conscious governments, they’ll still face steep competition from other industries. The aluminum industry has recently sought to use more of China’s hydropower in an effort to cut down on its emissions, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com./2021/06/22/china-bitcoin-mining-ban-sichuan-hydropower/"&gt;competing with miners&lt;/a&gt; for the resource. Adding to the energy crunch, hydropower isn’t limitless — recent &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/inconvenient-truth-droughts-shrink-hydropower-pose-risk-global-push-clean-energy-2021-08-13/"&gt;droughts&lt;/a&gt; in China cut into the country’s existing hydroelectric supply. Severe drought is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;reducing hydroelectric power generation&lt;/a&gt; in the western US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuAYx2"&gt;Competition can also end up driving more pollution into the atmosphere, even in areas with clean energy sources. When utilities run low on or use up all the available hydropower, they often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;turn to dirty natural gas&lt;/a&gt; to meet demand. The demand for energy can also make things more costly for locals. In the US, Bitcoin miners flocked to places with cheap hydroelectricity, including &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/09/bitcoin-mining-energy-prices-smalltown-feature-217230/"&gt;East Wenatchee, Washington&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/cheap-power-drew-bitcoin-miners-to-this-small-city-then-came-the-backlash"&gt;Plattsburgh, New York&lt;/a&gt;. Mining gobbled up so much electricity that it drove utility bills up for local residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDW0SC"&gt;Kazakhstan and Russia are the other two countries luring in the most miners. Kazakhstan, bordering Xinjiang, China, still relies &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/kazakhstan-energy-profile"&gt;primarily on coal for its electricity&lt;/a&gt; generation. Hydropower makes up about 17 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/RUS"&gt;Russia’s electricity mix&lt;/a&gt;, which is still primarily dominated by fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBG9gA"&gt;Earlier this year, a &lt;a href="https://wintonark.medium.com/bitcoin-mining-impact-on-renewable-uptake-fc91c5aa9be0"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; and proof of concept &lt;a href="https://github.com/ARKInvest/SolarBatteryBitcoin"&gt;model&lt;/a&gt; made the rounds in the cryptocurrency community that made the argument that Bitcoin can spur renewable energy growth. In theory, Bitcoin could help utilities generate the capital needed to upgrade the grid so it can handle more intermittent sources of energy like solar power, according to the analysis by high-profile asset management company ARK Invest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mzgqMg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Until we see implementation of this, I’m skeptical.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WI6V2X"&gt;That argument hasn’t won over Köhler or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434617/renewable-energy-bitcoin-pollution-tesla-elon-musk"&gt;de Vries&lt;/a&gt;. “Until we see implementation of this, I’m skeptical,” Köhler says. The model is based on the assumption that mining machines only operate during part of the day, not 24/7 like they typically do. Köhler and de Vries don’t see the incentive for miners to cut into their profit by limiting their operations. “Just to cover the impacts of their community, the [Bitcoin] community will have to take tremendous steps to introduce renewable energies. And this has not happened,” Köhler says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGj7ee"&gt;The other thing to keep in mind, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is that the biggest driver of Bitcoin’s emissions is its profitability. The higher its price — it’s currently at about $43,000 per coin — the more incentive there is to mine it. With more mining comes more energy consumption and pollution balloons. And despite the global shuffling around this year, Bitcoin’s energy consumption — and presumably its emissions — has still managed to &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;grow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbYPWA"&gt;There are other cryptocurrencies that have figured out how to solve the pollution problem. Ethereum, for example, plans to take puzzles out of the process for minting new tokens, which would slash nearly all of its emissions. But as long as Bitcoin is still the biggest player — and there are no plans for it to move away from its current polluting model — the cryptocurrency community will continue to grapple with its huge carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Wars: Visions has a lot more fun than Marvel’s What If…?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="star wars visions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/out6ism_2B8CPiW8V6W0hLOHhqI=/1396x0:3840x1629/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932408/2021_08_12_trailer_uhd_r709f_still_03.086899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lucasfilm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIqBzx"&gt;Both Marvel and Star Wars can get a little too serious for their own good. Their stories are often so focused on what happened before, or what’s coming next, that they forget about the fact that people are tuning in to watch thrilling adventures about superheroes and space wizards. What I’m saying is, both franchises often put canon ahead of fun. But Disney Plus has offered them a chance to cut loose a little in the form of the animated anthologies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The two series take very different approaches to the concept of messing with established stories and characters — and some extra freedom means that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; ends up being a lot more exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrJBYS"&gt;The premise of &lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; is pure comic book fodder: each episode imagines a scenario in which a pivotal moment from the MCU goes in a completely different direction. In the very first episode, Steve Rodgers remains a skinny kid while Peggy Carter becomes a shield-wielding supersoldier. Later stories imagine Thor as a single-child-turned-interstellar-party-animal and explore how T’Challa’s inherent goodness can change anyone around him, whether it’s some space scavengers or Thanos himself. There are episodes with zombies and robot armies, and the most recent ponders what would happen if Ultron defeated the Avengers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i6ZfY5IK8pRq8TTsA13aP_ND7GY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890911/107_hba0600_comp_v003_8d1eb78b.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m40g4h"&gt;Most of the episodes are entertaining twists, particularly for long-time Marvel fans. I particularly enjoyed seeing superpowered beings turned into various types of undead monsters. (If there isn’t a Marvel zombies video game in the works, I’ll be very disappointed.) But the series never strays &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; far from the MCU. These are still the characters fans know from the live-action movies and shows — they even look and sound the same, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22652048/marvel-what-if-character-design-interview-ryan-meinerding"&gt;thanks to &lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt;’s JC Leyendecker-inspired art style&lt;/a&gt; and the fact that stars like Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston reprised their roles. And each of the storylines is intrinsically tied to something that’s already happened. They’re even starting to tie in with &lt;em&gt;each other&lt;/em&gt; rather than being standalone. The twists are fun, but they also only make sense if you’re already invested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhto9S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, manages to break away from the Skywalker saga and its associated baggage completely. In fact, aside from brief appearances by Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt, the anthology consists of entirely new characters and stories, largely detached from the sci-fi universe as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPu5AD"&gt;Part of this has to do with how it was made. &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; is a collaboration between LucasFilm and a handful of anime studios, who were able to bring new ideas to the sci-fi universe. Because of this, each episode of &lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; has a different look and feel. Studio Colorido’s episode is a rock opera, while Science SARU created something reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Astro Boy&lt;/em&gt;. The series opens with a short from Kamikaze Douga that’s like an Akira Kurosawa movie with lightsabers, complete with a droid wearing a straw hat. &lt;em&gt;Visions &lt;/em&gt;also has some of the most memorable lightsaber duels in all of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, made all the more kinetic thanks to the incredible animation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAmuai"&gt;These are the kinds of stories you’d never find in the more straitlaced &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; canon. Cute as Baby Yoda might be, it’s hard to imagine him getting to perform in a rock band when he’s all grown up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9X26YQ3iqzC_XXTJegSs3Q7KwY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890914/105_ffa0400_comp_v003_ed7caece.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6IOwlu"&gt;As both Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; approach oversaturation — for some viewers, that point is already long gone — these kinds of one-off projects are important. They make things exciting again. They remind us why we love these universes in the first place, without all the added headaches that come from a big, interconnected storyline. There’s no wondering about the lineage of Rey or having to pretend to care about Hawkeye. Just cool, short stories full of laser swords and unexpected battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RshYxp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visions&lt;/em&gt; does this fully and completely, carving out its own place far from the established mythos. &lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have quite the same freedom, and as it approaches its final episode next week, it appears to be building to the kind of epic showdown the MCU has become synonymous with. But it’s a start — and maybe one day, we’ll get to see what Studio Trigger could do with Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Basics ripped off accessories, now Amazon is coming for gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lv6Hf2ieQ4QhiMbRDMRK3pvyUow=/0x0:894x596/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932393/amazon_halo_view.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Halo View and the Fitbit Charge 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon / Fitbit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kz3IEW"&gt;In the image above there are two wearables. One is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;Fitbit’s recently released Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;, a $179.95 fitness tracker designed to measure everything from your heart rate to your sleep and even your skin temperature. The other is Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692305/amazon-halo-view-fitness-tracker-nutrition-membership-screen"&gt;$79.99 Halo View fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt;, which Amazon says can measure everything from your heart rate to your sleep and skin temperature. Ten points if you can tell me which is which. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0XYSe"&gt;The Halo View was just one of a host of new devices announced by Amazon at its now annual fall hardware event this week. But while many of Amazon’s new products feature completely original designs and features, like its cute &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;Astro “home robot”&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692048/ring-always-home-cam-drone-amazon-price-release-date-specs"&gt;Ring-branded home surveillance drone&lt;/a&gt;, there were a handful that bear a striking resemblance to preexisting products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29Sk3D"&gt;Take Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692248/amazon-smart-thermostat-price-ambient-computer-alexa-preorder"&gt;$59.99 smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt;, which works with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa, and promises to detect when you’re home and adjust the temperature accordingly. That’s very similar to what other Alexa-enabled thermostats like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646398/ecobee-smartthermostat-review-alexa-announcement-price-specs-features"&gt;$250 Ecobee smart thermostat&lt;/a&gt; offer, but at a fraction of the price. Not to mention Amazon’s design is also similar to a preexisting smart thermostat &lt;a href="https://www.tado.com/gb-en/smart-thermostat-overview"&gt;produced by a company called Tado&lt;/a&gt; (which itself retails for the equivalent of around $240). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpdZgFOwgteEHWjNNPco0qh2or0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884768/AMZ_Smart_Thermostat_media_lifestyle_01.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uI4QI4"&gt;Not every smart thermostat needs to look completely original or have a unique set of features (after all, there’s only so much a thermostat can do). But the announcement of Amazon’s own Smart Thermostat comes just months after &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-strong-arms-partners-across-multiple-businesses-11618410439"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Ecobee had been nervous about sharing additional data with Amazon, in part due to fears that this data could help it launch competing products, as concerns that it could harm consumer privacy. Ecobee was reportedly told that failing to provide this data, which would send information to Amazon about the device’s status even when a customer wasn’t using it, could risk the company losing its Alexa certification for future models or not be featured in Prime Day sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu4pgm"&gt;In response to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s enquiry, Amazon said it hadn’t used data from any other Alexa-connected thermostats to design its Smart Thermostat. It said the device had been co-created with Resideo, a company that has also worked on Honeywell’s Home thermostats, and that Ecobee continues to be one of its valued partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="So5iTk"&gt;Meanwhile, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692305/amazon-halo-view-fitness-tracker-nutrition-membership-screen"&gt;new Halo membership features&lt;/a&gt; look like obvious competitors to MyFitnessPal. Halo Nutrition is designed to help users find recipes and cook food that fits their dietary needs, similar to the &lt;a href="https://blog.myfitnesspal.com/watch/how-to-use-the-meal-plans-feature-on-the-app/"&gt;Meal Plans feature&lt;/a&gt; MyFitnessPal already includes as part of its premium plan. There’s also Halo Fitness’ guided workouts, similar to the self-guided routines &lt;a href="https://support.myfitnesspal.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036071232"&gt;from MyFitnessPal&lt;/a&gt;. But Amazon’s health subscription is a lot cheaper than MyFitnessPal’s premium tier. Amazon includes a free year of its Halo membership services with the purchase of its new Halo View fitness tracker, and it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQAJNVT7S4XCHMT2"&gt;retails for $3.99 / month thereafter&lt;/a&gt;, which is less than half the price of MyFitnessPal’s $9.99 premium tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Us4mDE"&gt;When we asked Amazon about these similarities, it said it had not copied other companies, and that its Halo service includes unique features not available with other fitness trackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pUweSZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s bags, shoes, and laptop stands have attracted scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PeIqyr"&gt;Responding to questions from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon said it’s “pioneered hundreds of features, products, and even entirely new categories” throughout its history. “Amazon’s ideas are our own,” the company said, citing products such as the Kindle, Amazon Echo, and Fire TV as prominent examples of its original inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MPXzM"&gt;I’m not trying to claim that Amazon is breaking any rules with these products. There are only so many ways you can design a screen that straps to your wrist and shows you your heart rate — even if this one has clear Fitbit vibes — or a panel that attaches on your wall to control the temperature. Even complicated devices like smartphones have seen their designs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2020/2/14/21137184/folding-phone-flip-form-factor-razr-galazy-z-fold"&gt;gradually converge over the years&lt;/a&gt;, a process not helped by the fact that many manufacturers are using components supplied by the same small handful of companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ZXhR"&gt;But the similarities look cynical coming from Amazon, which has been criticized for ripping off the designs of products sold on its platform and then undercutting them on price. Earlier this year, bag and accessory manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;Peak Design drew attention to the startling similarity&lt;/a&gt; between its $99.95 Everyday Sling and Amazon Basics’ $32.99 Camera Bag, for example. Amazon’s version of the bag has since been discontinued, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_mRdyQO6sby6eidXXOILDKOMqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343026/Screen_Shot_2021_03_03_at_11.08.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peak Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peak Design’s bag next to a very similar model from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zFvjDf"&gt;Amazon’s cloning of the Peak Design bag wasn’t an isolated incident, either. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/19/20874818/amazon-allbirds-shoe-clone-copy-sneaker-206-collective-private-label"&gt;striking similarities were also pointed out&lt;/a&gt; between the $45 shoes produced by Amazon’s 206 Collective label and Allbirds’ $95 equivalent. The similarities prompted Allbirds CEO Joey Zwillinger to &lt;a href="https://joeyzwillinger.medium.com/dear-mr-bezos-e691f6d6d705"&gt;respond in a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; saying that he was “flattered at the similarities that your private label shoe shares with ours,” but politely asked that Amazon also “steal our approach to sustainability” and use similarly renewable materials. Amazon said that the shoe has also since been discontinued, but that it continues to offer similar styles. Amazon also said its original design did not infringe on Allbirds’ design, and that the aesthetic is common across the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XcKrWs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Amazon is now straight copying Allbirds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have reached "peak cloning" in Silicon Valley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are no rules anymore - if you build a product that works, Amazon or Facebook will copy it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People used to care. Not anymore. &lt;a href="https://t.co/73bDMgruMX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/73bDMgruMX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Morris Jr. (@jmj) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmj/status/1174736361783300097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 19, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PPchB4"&gt;Or what about the Amazon Basics Laptop Stand that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-20/got-a-hot-seller-on-amazon-prepare-for-e-tailer-to-make-one-too?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported on in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched at around half the price of Rain Design’s (at the time) bestselling $43 model? Harvey Tai, Rain Design’s general manager, said that the company’s sales had slipped since Amazon’s competing model appeared on the store, although he admitted that “there’s nothing we can do because they didn’t violate the patent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fa635"&gt;Copying and attempting to undercut dominant market players is nothing new. But Amazon is in a fairly unique position in that it’s not just competing with these products; in a lot of cases, it’s also selling them via its own platform. That theoretically gives it access to a goldmine of data which could be invaluable if it wanted to launch a competitor of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N41CHw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A WSJ investigation accused Amazon employees of accessing data on competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jp0pEm"&gt;Amazon was accused of doing exactly this in a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-scooped-up-data-from-its-own-sellers-to-launch-competing-products-11587650015"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;investigation&lt;/a&gt; last year, which alleged that Amazon’s employees “have used data about independent sellers on the company’s platform to develop competing products.” The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; specifically cited an instance where an unnamed Amazon private-label employee accessed detailed sales data about a car-trunk organizer from a company called Fortem launched in 2016. In 2019, Amazon launched three similar competitors under its Amazon Basics label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g66FJz"&gt;The same report also detailed an instance of employees accessing sales data for a popular office-chair seat cushion from Upper Echelon Products, before Amazon launched its own competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ba5yJO"&gt;Amazon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that an internal investigation conducted following the publication of the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report found no violations of its policies prohibiting the use of non-public individual seller data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayntmb"&gt;Whether or not Amazon’s employees are breaking its rules, regulators have taken notice. Last year the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;EU accused Amazon&lt;/a&gt; of using “non-public seller data” to inform Amazon’s own retail offers and business decisions. “Data on the activity of third party sellers should not be used to the benefit of Amazon when it acts as a competitor to these sellers,” the European Commission’s antitrust tzar, Margrethe Vestager, said at the time. The Commission has yet to issue a final report or findings, and in a statement Amazon said it disagreed with its accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1wYAny"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon has policies against misusing nonpublic data&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ntK1W3"&gt;For its part, Amazon says it has a policy of preventing its employees from using “nonpublic, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch.” But the company’s founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349440/amazon-marketplace-third-party-sellers-antitrust-hearing-jeff-bezos"&gt;told lawmakers last year&lt;/a&gt; that he couldn’t guarantee the policy has never been violated, and sources interviewed by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;said that employees found ways around these rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xR9NWl"&gt;These accusations have so far centered around low-tech items like bags, shoes, and trunk organizers. But as Amazon has expanded into more areas of consumer tech, its designs are once again straying very close to the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vj86f8"&gt;Given these concerns, it seems especially bizarre that Amazon was willing to reference the price of competing smart thermostats sold via its platform during the launch. Its smart thermostat is “less than half the average cost of a smart thermostat sold on Amazon.com,” the company’s senior vice president of devices and services, Dave Limp, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSjUPi"&gt;Once again, I need to stress that there’s nothing illegal (to my knowledge) about using public information like pricing in order to inform your own products. But taking a moment to specifically reference the pricing of competing devices sold on your own monolithic online store is an odd choice in the midst of all this scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9I9Bt6"&gt;It will be impossible to know how closely the functionality of each of Amazon’s new products are to their competitors until we’ve tried them for ourselves. But given Amazon’s size and market power, these kinds of awkward questions need to be asked. After all, Amazon is treading an awkward line between operating one of the largest sales platforms in the world, and competing within them as an increasingly prolific consumer tech manufacturer. It’s a difficult balance, and regulators are watching.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Rife with sexism’: employees of Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin describe ‘toxic’ workplace culture </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AWARD-BEZOS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnpvlAXo9ZWK3Z-61EIcL26mOqA=/0x0:4497x2998/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69932028/1177532676.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1M5cUa"&gt;Twenty-one current and former employees of Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin published &lt;a href="https://www.lioness.co/post/bezos-wants-to-create-a-better-future-in-space-his-company-blue-origin-is-stuck-in-a-toxic-past"&gt;a damning essay&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday saying the company “turns a blind eye to sexism, is not sufficiently attuned to safety concerns, and silences those who seek to correct wrongs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8xjI5"&gt;Co-authored by Blue Origin’s former head of employee communications Alexandra Abrams, the essay describes multiple accounts of sexist and dismissive behavior from some of the company’s “one-hundred percent” male senior technical and program leaders and says “professional dissent at Blue Origin is actively stifled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Y01m"&gt;The employees accuse the company’s CEO, Bob Smith, of brushing off dissent by discouraging staff from raising questions during internal town halls, asking a colleague to track “troublemakers or agitators,” and forcing out employees for speaking out about safety issues related to Blue Origin’s New Shepard tourism rocket. “Smith’s inner circle of loyalists makes unilateral decisions, often without the buy-in of engineers, other experts, or senior leaders across various departments,” the employees say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEZSqI"&gt;In an interview with CBS this morning, Abrams, speaking out for the first time, said she was fired by Blue Origin in 2019, quoting her manager as saying, “Bob and I can’t trust you anymore,” referring to the CEO. “You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time,” Abrams said in the interview. “I’ve gotten far enough away from it that I’m not afraid enough to let them silence me anymore.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BX5hY7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Alexandra Abrams, a former head of employee communications for Blue Origin, is speaking out against the company to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LaurieSegall?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LaurieSegall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You cannot create a culture of safety and a culture of fear at the same time. They are incompatible.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/JHuFY3cjcs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JHuFY3cjcs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CBSMornings/status/1443553601851322372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eIuM1Y"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Blue Origin spokesperson said, “Blue Origin has no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind. We provide numerous avenues for employees, including a 24/7 anonymous hotline, and will promptly investigate any new claims of misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps3fKG"&gt;The spokesperson also said Abrams was fired “after repeated warnings for issues involving federal export control regulations,” a claim Abrams denied to CBS News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuERH4"&gt;The essay, published on Lioness, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537102/tech-workers-harassment-hotline-vault-lioness-strategies"&gt;platform for whistleblowers&lt;/a&gt;, indicated Blue Origin sometimes overlooked safety issues to favor speed amid heated competition with other billionaire-backed companies like Elon Musk’s SpaceX or Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic. “Competing with other billionaires — and ‘making progress for Jeff’ — seemed to take precedence over safety concerns that would have slowed down the schedule,” the employees said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzY7wJ"&gt;A spokesperson for the Federal Aviation Administration, which manages launch safety and oversees flights of Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket, said, “the FAA takes every safety allegation seriously, and the agency is reviewing the information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6w0H0"&gt;In the essay, the employees also recounted sexism from colleagues, including a former, unnamed executive who would call female employees “baby girl,” “baby doll,” or “sweetheart” and ask about their dating lives. “It appeared to many of us that he was protected by his close personal relationship with Bezos — it took him physically groping a female subordinate for him to finally be let go,” they said. Another passage included: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Xu4gi5"&gt;Additionally, a former NASA astronaut and Blue Origin senior leader once instructed a group of women with whom he was collaborating: “You should ask my opinion because I am a man.” We found many company leaders to be unapproachable and showing clear bias against women. Concerns related to flying New Shepard were consistently shut down, and women were demeaned for raising them. When one man was let go for poor performance, he was allowed to leave with dignity, even a going-away party. Yet when a woman leader who had significantly improved her department’s performance was let go, she was ordered to leave immediately, with security hovering until she exited the building five minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="92maFt"&gt;On top of the safety and sexism claims, the letter attacks Bezos and Blue Origin’s record on environmental issues. The employees say while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141132/jeff-bezos-earth-fund-ten-billion-climate-change"&gt;Bezos touts his climate initiatives&lt;/a&gt;, Blue Origin has no plans to be carbon neutral or reduce its environmental footprint and that some machinery ordered by the company was done so without considering its waste levels or whether it’d need permits to manage the waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTm5R0"&gt;The employees also described harsh and demanding conditions that have “taken a toll on the mental health of many of the people who make Blue Origin’s operations possible.” The essay cites internal memos, including one that cast SpaceX as a model, “in that ‘burnout was part of their labor strategy.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTP72u"&gt;Blue Origin has struggled with internal strife in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZeZf7"&gt;In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21198272/blue-origin-coronavirus-leaked-audio-test-launch-workers-jeff-bezos"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported that Blue Origin employees were outraged by the pressure they faced from senior leadership&lt;/a&gt; to continue in-person work and travel for a New Shepard test launch during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, when much of the country was locking down to curb the virus’s spread. Responding to employee concerns in one meeting, Jeff Ashby, the company’s senior mission assurance director and a former NASA astronaut, said: “I would say that you should ask yourself, as an individual, are you acting as a toxin in the organization, fanning discontent, or are you really trying to help our senior leaders make better decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqzov7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 30th, 2:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds additional information from the essay and a statement from the FAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s new $15 smart scale has a mode for luggage, pets, and babies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_hyn0twk_5o5t0b16-Dl6U-kgyo=/0x2:7952x5303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931929/10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="STYoUm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDNbK0"&gt;Wyze, the budget-focused tech company that now sells everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686582/new-wyze-pan-cam-v2-specs-release-date-price-shipping"&gt;security cameras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450637/wyze-headphones-video-doorbell-c-pricing-release-date"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt;, has launched a new smart scale with four built-in electrodes capable of measuring everything from body fat percentage to body water percentage. In addition to weighing humans, there is also a dedicated mode to let you weigh your “baby, pet, luggage, or your kid’s absurdly heavy backpack,” Wyze says. The Scale S follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190980/wyze-band-wearable-fitness-tracker-alexa-scale-connected-price"&gt;original Wyze Scale released last year&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s $5 cheaper with a price of just $15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf3RIU"&gt;Weight is displayed on the built-in 3.5-inch LED display, while a companion app (of course) allows you to set goals and track progress over time. It can sync data with Fitbit, Google Fit, and Apple Health and track data for up to eight different users. Battery life is rated at 18 months from the included trio of AAA batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GfOyMUhcJrxogZTBc9OJ3hiRLyQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22889709/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Wyze&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a dedicated mode for weighing a dog (center) or child (bottom right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFUGMG"&gt;In total, Wyze says the Scale S is capable of measuring 11 body composition metrics, which is broadly in line with its original scale. These include: weight, body fat percentage, lean body mass, BMI, muscle weight, visceral fat, basal metabolic rate, bone mass, metabolic age, protein, and body water percentage. The Scale S will also eventually be able to track heart rate, Wyze says, although this functionality is launching later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLCskC"&gt;Alongside its scales, Wyze is also announcing a version of its &lt;a href="https://mailtrack.io/trace/link/dd1a477bcf547777c281116073fca81b2cef2163?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwyze.com%2Fwyze-cam-outdoor.html&amp;amp;userId=7067207&amp;amp;signature=aae0f1cd79790f85"&gt;Wyze Cam Outdoor&lt;/a&gt; with a Forest Camo skin made in collaboration with Dbrand. The camera is shipping now for $59.99, which translates to a $10 premium over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21298757/wyze-cam-outdoor-release-date-news-features-battery-life-cloud-subscription"&gt;standard outdoor security camera&lt;/a&gt;. The Wyze Scale S, meanwhile, is available to preorder starting today and will ship in November. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SqrB95"&gt;Facebook will now let you start cross-app group chats between Messenger and Instagram, the &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/09/30/new-group-chat-experiences-cross-app-chats-chat-themes-polls-and-watch-together/"&gt;company announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The update is a big step forward in Facebook’s ambitions to make its apps work better with each other. To be able to use the cross-app communications, you’ll have to opt in, and Facebook says that “over 70% of eligible people on Instagram have updated to the new Messenger experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcn6HF"&gt;The company is bringing other new features to the messaging apps in addition to cross-app group messaging. Polls will be available in group DMs on Instagram and in cross-app chats so you can, for example, vote on where to grab lunch. Facebook has added group typing indicators to Messenger, so you can see when multiple people are drafting a message. (It’s unclear from Facebook’s blog post if group typing indicators are coming to Instagram as well, but I’ve asked the company to clarify that.) And you can now use Facebook’s Watch Together feature to watch videos from your Instagram feed with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qH5Tag"&gt;Facebook is also adding new chat themes to Messenger, including a “cottagecore” theme, one inspired by J Balvin’s latest album, and an astrology theme.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 compares with Samsung’s flagship foldable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dHCahZ1ArfRO8wI2MKOd-lbZK5o=/0x0:1361x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931863/Microsoft_Surface_Duo_2_Lifestyle_Press_Image_White_Colorway.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 works with Microsoft’s lineup of Surface Pens, including the Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/em&gt;. | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uvp11o"&gt;It’s official: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;troubled Surface Duo&lt;/a&gt; is now last-gen. Microsoft announced its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686707/microsoft-surface-duo-2-phone-design-specs-features-photos-hands-on"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt;, during its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;fall Surface event&lt;/a&gt;, capping off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593992/microsoft-surface-duo-2-triple-camera-leak-photos"&gt;months of rumors&lt;/a&gt; and introducing the device alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22685923/microsoft-surface-pro-8-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686010/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt;, and a bevy of new devices designed to take advantage of &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84OsSx"&gt;The new Android-based smartphone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684814/microsoft-surface-duo-2-price-specs-features-release-date"&gt;starts at $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt; — $100 less than the original — and launches on October 20th in multiple configurations. It retains the hinged design of its predecessor — only this time, it comes equipped with a more thought-out camera system, 5G support, and a modern processor that brings it more in line with flagships from Samsung, Xiaomi, and OnePlus. And while it’s not a foldable in the traditional sense — it’s outfitted with two screens, not one — it’s not in a class of its own, either. Blame the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2upDAP"&gt;The Fold 3 recently set the bar for what foldable phones could achieve, bringing with it better multitasking, a water-resistant build, and a refined display that’s a notable step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/19/18498904/samsung-galaxy-fold-review-screen-broken-issue-durability-foldable-phone-video-performance-price"&gt;original model&lt;/a&gt; released in 2019. But is Samsung’s premium foldable a match for the forthcoming Duo 2? After all, Samsung’s foldable is markedly different from Microsoft’s when it comes to design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nFo0sv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best phone to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone"},{"title":"The best smartphone you can buy under $500","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wv8PG"&gt;The Fold 3 features a smaller, 6.2-inch display that covers the entire front of the device. It also contains a flexible, 7.6-inch OLED on the inside, which unfurls as you open the phone with the aid of an aluminum hinge. There’s still a small gap between the two sides when closed, however, which is visible on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; as well. The latter phone — an entirely different device from the Fold 3 we’re comparing here — also features a foldable display, only the device is smaller, folds vertically, and retails for $700 less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGVNFp"&gt;The Duo 2 doesn’t rely on a flexible display. Like its predecessor, it uses two separate, 5.8-inch OLED panels that amount to 8.3 inches when viewed together, with a large bezel running between them. The hinge connecting the two displays allows you to fold the phone in half with the displays on the outside so you can use the device one-handed, though the phone’s large camera bump means they’ll never close completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dktYqz"&gt;The screens — while the selling point — aren’t everything, however. Below, we’ve compared the Fold 3 and Duo 2 in more detail ahead of our full Duo 2 review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f3yzsB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10768369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tqSzKP"&gt;Spec-for-spec, in some ways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="leOvHG"&gt;To put it mildly: the original Surface 2 had its shortcomings. The camera was atrocious, the software buggy, and Microsoft was still charging a starting price of $1,399 for just the device, a staggering number when you consider the faults. And while it was seemingly released premature, it was innovative, so much so &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn hoped — like me — that we’d see a second iteration of the smartphone down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJoj2U"&gt;Well, here it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8nmPdR4lB6wNvS4fhfJT8IIlQ7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22868426/bfarsace_210921_4770_0049.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Duo 2 features thinner bezels and the same processor found as the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xYD311"&gt;On paper, the Surface Duo 2 looks to address many of the aforementioned problems. It’s equipped with the same high-end Snapdragon 888 processor found in the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which is Qualcomm’s latest chipset and the brains behind almost every Android flagship released this year, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;. Like the Z Fold 3, the second-gen Duo will be available in both 128GB and 512GB storage configurations when it launches next month, as well as an additional 128GB variant. The Duo 2 only features 8GB of RAM, however, compared to the Fold 3’s 12GB. Software optimization will certainly play a role in how efficient the phone is at multitasking, but the Fold 3 has the upper hand spec-wise. Both phones also support 5G connectivity, Wi-Fi 6, and NFC for contactless payments — something the original Duo did not offer — along with either Bluetooth 5.0 or 5.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrhOLY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697006"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P0VneZ"&gt;Battery capacity tells a similar story. The Fold 3 packs in a 4,400mAh battery, which, in our testing, lasted a full day with roughly four hours of screen time. The Duo 2 features dual batteries that add up to a capacity of 4,449mAh, and Samsung claims they should provide 15.5 hours of local video playback and 28 hours of talk time. Both models also support fast charging and USB-C; however, the Fold 3 additionally supports wireless charging, whereas the Duo 2 does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgjzwo"&gt;We’ll have a better sense of how far that battery capacity will get you once we’ve tested the device, but the increased capacity on this year’s Duo should help it compensate for the 90Hz display and added 5G support. The two batteries inside the original Duo only added up to a mere 3,577mAh, yet we routinely made it through a full day on a single charge. We’re hoping the same can be said of the Duo 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lzokQU"&gt;Displays on display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 houses a vibrant, 7.6-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate on the inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtppzUsJYDXp1-B7atPOX1httEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22869992/Surface_Duo_2_with_Pen_under_embargo_until_September_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slight curviture of the Duo 2’s displays allows them to act as a notification panel when closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUe60X"&gt;Like all foldables, the defining characteristic of the Duo 2 and Fold 3 are the displays, which afford each smartphone more screen real estate and allow them to function a bit more akin to a tablet when opened. On the inside, the Fold 3 features a bright, 7.6-inch OLED screen with 2208 x 1768 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. It also sports a 6.2-inch display on the cover with 2268 x 832 resolution and, again, a 120Hz refresh rate. In our testing, we found both displays to be a vast improvement over earlier iterations, with the inner display showcasing an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;added level of durability&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Samsung’s custom aluminum alloy. The exterior display on the Fold 3 also means you don’t need to open the device in order to use it, which renders it a little closer to a traditional phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpyKGf"&gt;The Duo 2, however, takes a different approach. Inside, you’ll find two 5.8-inch OLED panels, each with 1344 x 1892 resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. When opened, the dual panels create an 8.3-inch display with 2688 x 1892 resolution, with a bezel running between the two. The Duo 2 doesn’t offer an exterior cover like the Fold 3; however, the curved glass on the edges of the display does showcase the time and some notifications when the phone is closed, giving you some basic info at a glance. The 360-degree hinge also allows you to open the Duo 2 like a book or prop it up like a tent, providing an added level of flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7An523"&gt;The outward design of both models is as varied as their approach to the display. The Fold 3 is relatively tall and narrow when closed, weighing in at 271 grams. The hinge-reliant Duo 2 is slightly shorter and heavier at 284 grams, though; it’s also thinner — so thin, in fact, that Microsoft claims the Duo 2 is the thinnest 5G device on the market (it’s only 11 millimeters thick when closed). It’s not as thin as the original Duo, which measures 9.9 millimeters at the hinge, but it’s close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhJ4k"&gt;Additionally, both smartphones use Gorilla Glass Victus, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335252/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-drop-scratch-resistant-apple-samsung"&gt;Corning claims can resist&lt;/a&gt; a six-foot drop while continuing to ward off scratches. The Fold 3, however, takes things further with IPX8 water resistance, meaning it can be fully submerged in up to half a meter of water for up to 30 minutes. We don’t anticipate most people will rush out to dunk their phones, but it’s nice to know it can handle an unforeseen spill or a little rain. The Duo 2 only offers an IPX1 rating, which, honestly, is effectively nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o3WpTd"&gt;Android 11 all around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SXHsG4"&gt;Unsurprisingly, the Duo 2 and Z Fold 3 are also similar on the software front. Whereas the first-gen Duo launched with Android 10 has yet to receive Android 11 — Microsoft says it will arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;before the end of the year&lt;/a&gt; — the Duo 2 ships with a customized version of the latter designed for better multitasking. The Fold 3 also runs on Android 11, albeit with some small visual and interface tweaks courtesy of Samsung’s custom One UI 3 skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The multitasking software on the Z Fold 3 is much more flexible than before." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S79WEKoUZ0TCUgJpSBFyqUC_56g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801132/Screenshot_20210823_123216_Twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to Samsung’s One UI 3, multitasking on the Z Fold 3 is actually an enjoyable experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o8ot3Q"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;Samsung said&lt;/a&gt; recent Galaxy devices will receive support for three generations of Android updates, and as such, the Fold 3 is set to receive routine Android OS updates alongside monthly security patches for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;next four years&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has promised timely updates for the Duo 2, but it’s still unclear as to what that looks like. A year after its debut, the original Duo remains buggy, despite Microsoft having shipped a number of updates to address multitasking and gesture issues. Samsung has a better track record when it comes to issuing software updates in a timely manner, a likely boon for the Fold 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wc7Wyb"&gt;Both smartphones are designed for multitasking and productivity, however, and their software reflects that. The Duo 2 can run two apps side by side or one app that can expand across both displays. The Duo 2 also boasts compatibility with Microsoft’s lineup of Surface Pens, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt;, which can magnetically dock and charge wirelessly when paired with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690565/surface-duo-2-pen-cover-price-release-date-slim-pen"&gt;optional Surface Duo 2 Pen Cover&lt;/a&gt; ($65). The Fold 3 offers a similar set of functionality thanks to features like Flex mode and App Pair, as well as the Fold-specific S Pen, which is sold separately and also requires a special case for storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CHi0cu"&gt;Camera components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s1cDvT"&gt;Camera-wise, neither model is aimed at photography enthusiasts. Microsoft’s next foldable may be a massive step up from its first-gen counterpart and, on paper, a slight cut above the Fold 3, but it’s still more midrange than flagship. That said, both the Duo 2 and the Fold 3 feature a three-camera array on the rear, with 12-megapixel sensors for wide and telephoto. The Duo 2, however, also includes a higher-resolution ultrawide camera (16MP compared to the Fold 3’s 12MP sensor), as well as optical image stabilization on the wide and ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGlDO6"&gt;Aperature, on the other hand, is nearly the same across both devices, with the wide-angle on the Duo 2 being slightly faster at f/1.7. We’ll have to wait until we can put the Duo 2 through its paces before we make a final judgment call, but if its three-camera array performs anything like that on the Fold 3, it’s still not going to compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zdTA_zVVycc6UWK44TP4PXTJjG8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22880543/Surface_Duo_2_Photography_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The three-camera array on the Duo 2 looks to be a significant step up from the 11MP sensor on the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="77SP3x"&gt;On the front, the Duo 2 sports a 12MP shooter with an f/2.0 aperture. The Fold 3 sports a 10MP selfie camera with an f/2.2 on the cover, along with a 4MP under-display camera on the interior, which is equal parts terrible and distracting given the distinct moire effect the experimental feature creates at certain viewing angles. Both devices can also capture 1080p and 4K video footage at 30 and 60fps, as well as slow-motion video at up to 240fps. The Fold 3 goes a bit further with support for 720p, slow-motion video at 960fps, and 4K hyperlapse videos at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0aFvlU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763735"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l8SCbz"&gt;Sky-high pricing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="di4uXg"&gt;Let’s face it: neither foldable is cheap — far from it. The 128GB base configuration of the Surface Duo 2 will &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeSurfaceDuo2092221&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-duo-2%2F9408kgxp4xjl%3Frtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;run you $1,499.99&lt;/a&gt;, with the 256GB and 512GB models retailing for $1,599.99 and $1,799.99, respectively. Like the original model, Microsoft’s latest foldable will be available in glacier white, in addition to a new obsidian black colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684018/microsoft-surface-duo-2-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;Preorders are already underway&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments expected to go out before the phone’s launch on October 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWLNiX"&gt;The Galaxy Fold 3 is even more expensive. The 256GB base model &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGyXdxDbnR#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retails for $1,799.99&lt;/a&gt; and is currently available in one of three colors: phantom green, phantom black, and phantom silver. The 512GB configuration runs $1,899.99; however, the larger model is only available in phantom black. Like the Duo 2, there are carrier deals, trade-in discounts, and payment plans available for the Fold 3; however, most kickbacks come in the form of credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCNlhE"&gt;While not the focal point of this comparison, there’s also the Galaxy Flip 3 to consider. The device’s internal display might be smaller, but the phone still features a Snapdragon 888 processor, 8GB of RAM, and a water-resistant build. It also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfGy2XM0TC2#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starts at $1,000&lt;/a&gt;, meaning it retails for around the same price as many high-end, non-folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZgrDZ5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="uxDVDs"&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dGDDHc"&gt;On paper, Microsoft’s Surface Duo 2 shows a lot of promise, particularly when compared to its predecessor. It has a modern, high-end processor and upgraded camera system, along with a bigger battery, larger displays, and 5G support. These are welcome upgrades, but we won’t have a concrete idea as to how well they perform until we can do an in-depth review. There’s also the question of longevity and support — will Microsoft truly update the Duo 2 in a timely fashion, or will it go the way of the Duo and only receive the occasional software patch and security update? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhyK87"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3, meanwhile, is the best foldable you can buy right now. The base configuration of the Fold 3 is $300 more than the starting price of the Duo 2, but it comes equipped with similar specs, along with a 120Hz display, wireless charging, and a waterproof, IPX8-rated design. The latter two features are now more of the norm than the exception, and it’s a shame Microsoft didn’t incorporate either with the Duo 2. Still, if you see no need for a display with a higher refresh rate or any of the aforementioned perks that come with the Fold 3, Microsoft’s second-gen foldable might be worth the wait.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors reportedly selling former GM factory to Foxconn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfWt7XNqGKBkt7qkW6nzTYD6sRk=/4x0:3996x2661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69931850/1232963349.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tzFs8g"&gt;Struggling EV startup Lordstown Motors is nearing a sale of its Ohio factory to Taiwanese iPhone assembler Foxconn, which has its own electric vehicle ambitions, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-30/lordstown-nears-deal-to-sell-ohio-car-plant-to-taiwan-s-foxconn?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The deal could be announced as soon as Thursday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozNjEu"&gt;Lordstown Motors bought the 6.2 million square foot facility from General Motors in 2019 shortly after the Detroit automaker closed it down — a decision that drew the ire of then-president Trump. The startup previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; that it was planning to rent out space at the factory in an effort to make money amid a serious cash crunch. &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com./business/autos-transportation/lordstown-motors-talks-sell-ohio-plant-foxconn-bloomberg-2021-09-30/"&gt;also reporting that a sale is on the verge of happening&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M05uqb"&gt;Since buying it, Lordstown Motors has put about $240 million worth of work into getting the factory ready to build its electric pickup truck, the Endurance. A spokesperson for Lordstown Motors declined to comment. Foxconn did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Tys6q"&gt;When GM sold the factory to Lordstown Motors, Trump praised the deal as “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” But the startup — which was founded by the former CEO of Workhorse, another struggling EV startup — has run into an incredible amount of trouble ever since, despite going public and raising hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020. Lordstown Motors’ CEO was forced out earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;after he was caught lying about the veracity of the preorders for its truck&lt;/a&gt;. The startup has lowered its initial production goals for that truck, too. Both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;launched probes into Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has said it only has enough money to survive through mid-2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tSzMQv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Foxconn’s empty buildings, empty factories, and empty promises in Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"},{"title":"Foxconn is dangling a shiny new EV plant in front of Wisconsin","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569992/foxconn-fisker-wisconsin-electric-vehicle-factory-talks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wBAayZ"&gt;Foxconn has spent much of the last year talking about expanding into electric vehicles as a way to diversify away from consumer electronics. It has struck deals with the likes of Geely, which is China’s largest private automaker, as well as Fisker Inc., a California EV startup that has yet to make an electric vehicle. Foxconn has also developed its own electric vehicle platform that it intends to sell to other automakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aU7S1x"&gt;In March, Foxconn said it would reveal where it wants to build EVs with Fisker Inc. by July, but that self-imposed deadline came and went. The company had considered using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;mostly empty complex it built in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; — another project that the Trump administration touted highly — but Fisker founder Henrik Fisker said he didn’t want to build his cars in a state that &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/08/09/fisker-ev-plans-for-underused-foxconn-site-hit-snag-on-wisconsin-auto-sales-rules/?sh=2f5f19ea79de"&gt;wouldn’t allow him to sell directly to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
