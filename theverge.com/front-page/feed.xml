    <title>Twitch defaced with pictures of Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1DqSH"&gt;Hackers have managed to deface Twitch for a few hours this morning, replacing a number of background game images with photos of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Users reported seeing images of Bezos in the listings for &lt;em&gt;GTA V&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Smite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and many more on the Amazon-owned service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39EQD1"&gt;It’s not clear how the background images were changed or whether this latest incident was aided by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;huge security breach at Twitch&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. Hackers were able to exploit a server misconfiguration and steal hundreds of gigabytes of information. Twitch is still investigating the breach, and so far &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712250/twitch-hack-leak-data-streamer-revenue-steam-competitor"&gt;a wealth of information&lt;/a&gt; pertaining to the website’s source code, unreleased projects, and even how much the top streamers make has been released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fOsliQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More Twitch shenanigans are afoot. All game directory header pictures on the Web version of Twitch are now showing a closeup picture of Jeff Bezos. It's been like this for the last 2 hours. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LcKP9jGMCC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LcKP9jGMCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AnEternalEnigma (@AnEternalEnigma) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnEternalEnigma/status/1446421951883489281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="P4rQWm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://clips.twitch.tv/embed?clip=AnnoyingPlayfulCakeOpieOP-mfEZnNwEfCP3ulPt&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LrJGPS"&gt;At least one former Twitch employee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714160/twitch-hack-security-data-breach-problems"&gt;warned that attackers&lt;/a&gt; can now see the shortcuts and APIs for internal Amazon services thanks to this leak. It’s entirely possible that the leak revealed some code that let people easily alter background images on Twitch, or that this was simply a case of cache poisoning. Twitch relies on different methods to cache images, and those may have experienced issues. Either way, Twitch isn’t having a good week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDLYqW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/q3tcbx/is_twitch_hacked/"&gt;Reddit users noticed&lt;/a&gt; the defaced images at &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/q3tdj9/gta_5s_banner_replaced_with_jeffrery_bezos_face/"&gt;around 5AM ET&lt;/a&gt; this morning, with several images showing Bezos’ face as a banner behind games listed in the Twitch directory. We’ve reached out to Twitch about this incident, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s 2020 iPad Air is down to its lowest price yet today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new iPad Air with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMfAHQh2K8WDQuNngHf5Tjy41L0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968651/vpavic_4244_20201020_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Keyboard is, unfortunately, sold separately.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sMOd8h"&gt;Apple’s fourth-generation iPad Air with a refreshed design and USB-C charging instead of Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J66ZMY7/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is down to its best price yet at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. You can get the 64GB Wi-Fi model in the color of your choosing for $489 — $10 less than the starting price &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;for the new iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; that has a similar design. For the price, you’re getting a far bigger tablet. If you’ve been in the market for a high-end iPad but don’t want to put down iPad Pro-levels of cash, this could be exactly what you’re after. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0lw7Hg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YtW7Pt"&gt;For the first time since launching earlier this year, the navy-colored Apple AirTag Loop is &lt;a href="http://adorama.rfvk.net/0Jjn2V"&gt;selling for $19 instead of its typical $29&lt;/a&gt; at Adorama. The simple, polyurethane loop allows you to add your AirTag — which lacks a lanyard hole — to accessories like your backpack, keychain, and luggage. Although there are often more affordable third-party loops available, this is a rare deal Apple fans may find worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tj5Kpn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795285"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3r70zX"&gt;If you’re in the market for a competent laptop, Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091WY8D1C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $849&lt;/a&gt;, a $250 discount. Equipped with 512GB of storage and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i5 processor, the 15.6-inch laptop normally goes for $1,100. In addition to offering an AMOLED display and 20 hours of battery life, the lightweight Windows machine also comes with Wi-Fi 6 compatibility, a Thunderbolt 4 port, and Intel’s Iris Xe integrated graphics. Those deeply embedded in the Samsung ecosystem might also enjoy how you can easily pair the clamshell laptop with Samsung’s line of Galaxy Buds and quickly share files across Galaxy devices with Quick Share. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GhiBux"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QP1QmY"&gt;Apple owners planning on traveling this upcoming holiday season may be interested in this rare discount on the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2FVerge%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fvergedailydeals092321%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fproducts%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-qi%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple MagSafe Duo Charger&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $129, Verizon is currently selling the charger — which you can fold to make smaller and thus more portable — for $97, one of its lowest prices to date. With the wireless charging station, you can charge MagSafe-compatible iPhone 12 and 13 models, as well as the Apple Watch, select AirPods models, and various Qi-certified devices. Note, however, that in order to fast-charge your iPhone, you’ll need at least a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-20W-USB-C-Power-Adapter/dp/B08L5M9BTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20W power brick&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow for charging speeds of up to 11W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7S41gC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="frrWKi"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero9&lt;/a&gt;, the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;biggest, baddest action camera out there&lt;/a&gt;,” is $70 cheaper today at Woot. Now until October 30th (or while supplies last), members can &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13527013?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fgopro-hero9-black-waterproof-action-camera-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pick up the popular action camera for $380&lt;/a&gt; instead of $450, with free shipping for Prime members. The GoPro Hero9 can capture 5K video at 60fps as well as 23MP stills, and it features a new processor and a removable lens. Just like the newer Hero10, it offers crisp footage along with a great front-facing screen and rugged build quality. As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review"&gt;Hero10 review&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen model is not too dissimilar from the more expensive Hero10 — that is, unless you need smooth, 5.3K 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fV9noY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10332746"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejat2B"&gt;Apple fans, we’ve got another deal you might love. If you’re open to a desktop computer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5P7TLW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $100&lt;/a&gt; on the 512GB version of the 2020 Mac Mini, which comes with Apple’s new M1 chip. Regularly $899, the Mac Mini is on sale at Amazon for $799, its lowest price to date. After testing the Mac Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;we found&lt;/a&gt; the device’s performance to be impressive and praised how well existing apps run on the M1 chip. We did, however, dislike the built-in speaker and the fact that the Mini only offers up to 16GB of unified memory. Note the 256GB configuration is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-Chip-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 cheaper today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, selling for $659.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l2cY7u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10795407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="YMlCPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OaNqWaV5j4cx0WB5BjSpqEwDxr4=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949627/Apple_watch_series7_availability_stainless_steel_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 features larger screens.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAQ6pp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;new Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; Series 7 was announced alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s the final device in Apple’s new lineup to launch. This newer model sits atop Apple’s current lineup of smartwatches, which still includes the SE and Series 3 rounding out the line. Featuring a slightly revamped design and larger display, the Series 7 comes in either a 41mm (up from 40mm) configuration starting at $399 or a 45mm (up from 44mm) configuration — each with optional cellular radios if you want to pay for service with your carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMTfvS"&gt;After Apple’s initial announcement billed them for release “later this fall,” we now know &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;the new models are set to release on October 15th&lt;/a&gt;, and you can &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder them now through Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWzYHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: We will update this post as more retailers open up preorder listings, as well as Apple’s own direct links and finalized pricing for the full Series 7 range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LuD92a"&gt;What’s New&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="roSEq8"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 prominently features that new, larger display that stretches the screen closer to the edges for a more full-bleed aesthetic and showing more actionable information at once. It has a slight curve at its farthest edges, though Apple says the watch is overall more durable thanks to a 50 percent thicker glass cover and IP6X rating for better dirt and sand resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RLkrZ"&gt;New watch faces exclusive to the Series 7 promise to put that extra screen real estate to work, while the watch maintains a physical footprint that is close to its predecessor. Apple has also improved charging speeds, including a new USB-C wireless magnetic fast charger with the watch that it claims will offer up to a 33 percent quicker charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lttaJ7"&gt;On the software side, the Apple Watch Series 7 runs watchOS 8, supports a full swiping keyboard for text input, is compatible with new workouts, and maintains all the health-tracking features found on prior iterations: sleep tracking, heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, and fall detection that now registers during workouts. There is plenty to take advantage of if you’re in the market for a new Apple Watch and prefer to have Apple’s latest and greatest iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LxippD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="TraF9d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0ZdgqF"&gt;The aluminum-encased Series 7 watches come in midnight, starlight, an updated blue, (PRODUCT) RED, and a new dark green colorway, so there is a bit to choose from whether you’re going for a discreet, bold, or rugged look. Let’s break down all that there is to offer here before we dive further into specific configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FWKvlA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10743503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s2wxGivMl3xRoA_Lx7GJydjaaKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900348/Apple_watch_series7_availability_aluminum_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 in midnight, starlight, green, blue, and PRODUCT (RED).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ixNYqI"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="yBbMqA"&gt;You can preorder your preferred configuration direct from Apple right now, with orders shipping on October 15th. The main options for you to decide on, aside from your preferred color, are size and connectivity. The base Apple Watch Series 7 configuration is a 41mm, GPS-only model that retails for $399. If the Series 7 follows the same pricing convention as the Series 6, you should be able to outfit the 41mm version with a cellular connection for $100 more. If you have a larger wrist or prefer bigger screens, the 45mm GPS-only model will most likely run $429, while its cellular-equipped counterpart climbs up to $529. We will confirm these Series 7 prices and update as soon as Apple announces pricing beyond the starting $399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iin96H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uoprLg"&gt;How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7 from phone carriers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3dbtKG"&gt;Most major phone carriers in the USA will also offer the cellular Apple Watch Series 7 for preorder, which can help if you prefer to purchase the smartwatch on a monthly installment plan you might already have for your phone. We anticipate Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all offering the Series 7 in each of its colors at the same starting price as Apple for its cellular models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxgiN"&gt;Apple has confirmed that when you &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy a cellular-equipped Apple Watch Series 7 through its own store&lt;/a&gt; and activate it on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100009682-14498937?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fshop%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/applewatch/SID/https://www.att.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sprint / T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, you will get $100 back.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g50QyqEKJq0rPdmM51JUYxdmD-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900357/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hermes_10052021.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Edition with Hermès strap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VH7yJz"&gt;More premium case options and custom configurator&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T46tsH"&gt;Apple has also offered the latest top-end watch in additional case materials for years. This generation is no different, with Apple confirming the Series 7 is to be sold in stainless steel and titanium finishes, as well as band options from luxury fashion boutique Hermès. The easiest way to preorder these is &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/695055/7613?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;directly from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, as not all retailers sell the more luxurious watches, and most people opt for the aluminum models, which offer the same functionality at a lower price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NR4t55"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fstudio%2Fapple-watch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22664661%2Fapple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch Studio&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s own online boutique for outfitting the exact custom configuration of Apple Watch a customer chooses, makes a return for the Series 7. If you prefer an Apple Watch in a particular combination of size, finish, color, and band, you can make your selection and pay the configured price directly from Apple. This is the only way to order one of the popular solo loop straps with your Apple Watch, as those fixed-length straps are only sold through Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans developer behind Unfollow Everything tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S1GiZY-WJjRrbuVLGrJjJK2JKAQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69968061/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xBjNqF"&gt;A developer who made a tool that let people automatically unfollow friends and groups on Facebook says he’s been banned permanently from the social networking site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTvE90"&gt;Louis Barclay was the creator of “Unfollow Everything,” a browser extension that allowed Facebook users to essentially delete their News Feed by unfollowing all their connections at once. Facebook allows users to individually unfollow friends, groups, and pages, which removes their content from the News Feed, the algorithmically-controlled heart of Facebook. Barclay’s tool automated this process, instantly wiping users’ News Feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdR9xS"&gt;As Barclay wrote of his experience using the tool in a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/facebook-unfollow-everything-cease-desist.html"&gt;recent article for &lt;em&gt;Slate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pMzZ0P"&gt;I still remember the feeling of unfollowing everything for the first time. It was near-miraculous. I had lost nothing, since I could still see my favorite friends and groups by going to them directly. But I had gained a staggering amount of control. I was no longer tempted to scroll down an infinite feed of content. The time I spent on Facebook decreased dramatically. Overnight, my Facebook addiction became manageable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cd3zMT"&gt;In response, Facebook sent Barclay a &lt;a href="https://louisbarclay.notion.site/Unfollow-Everything-cease-and-desist-letter-from-Facebook-ea219169421b457bb7ce010b7bf9ce1f"&gt;cease-and-desist letter&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, saying he’d violated the site’s terms of service by creating software that automated user interactions. Barclay says the company then “permanently disabled my Facebook and Instagram accounts” and “demanded that I agree to never again create tools that interact with Facebook or its other services.” Barclay notes that in addition to helping users, his “Unfollow Everything” tool was being used by researchers at the Swiss University of Neuchâtel to study the effects of the News Feed on people’s happiness. He says he couldn’t risk tangling in court with a trillion-dollar company like Facebook and so simply removed the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66HVPl"&gt;Barclay’s story has emerged at an inauspicious time for Facebook (though when is it a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; time for the perpetually-embattled firm?). Whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;appeared before Congress&lt;/a&gt; this week to testify about Facebook’s insatiable demand for growth, which Haugen says comes too often at the costs of users’ well-being. “It’s paying for its profits with our safety,” she said in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;episode of &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Documents leaked by Haugen include internal research conducted by Facebook that shows how using Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;exacerbates body issues and mental health problems&lt;/a&gt; for some teenagers. Facebook’s primary response to Haugen’s testimony has been to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;smear her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJr8HH"&gt;Compared to Haugen’s exposure of Facebook, Barclay’s story is relatively run-of-the-mill. After all, Facebook’s terms of service are very clear on what sort of tools users can build, and Unfollow Everything obviously violated this agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIAidN"&gt;But the episode still neatly illustrates Facebook’s approach to its user-base, and how it often wants to give people the feeling of control without letting them fully escape its grasp. The company is happy to let users unfollow people individually, but automating the process would make it too easy to opt-out of the News Feed, which is essential for keeping users coming back and lining Facebook’s pockets with advertising revenue. So, of course, tools like Barclay’s — even if they have limited uptake — are forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Zev2R"&gt;We’ve contacted Facebook about this story and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is coming to LG’s recent smart TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cichmddOWapAc67TELpqQeoWkJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967935/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3y8Sbl"&gt;TikTok has launched an app for LG’s 2020 and 2021 smart TVs, the TV manufacturer has announced. The app arrived on these recent webOS 5.0 and webOS 6.0 models with a firmware update that started rolling out on October 7th, but will also be coming to older 2019 TVs “in the coming months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFFOtm"&gt;The app is launching in the UK, France, and Germany, a TikTok representative confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That’s notable since TikTok’s smart TV apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174064/tiktok-tv-app-samsung-uk-fire-amazon"&gt;Samsung TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264642/tiktok-android-tv-launch-not-working-google"&gt;Android TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573707/tiktok-fire-tv-app-uk-france-germany-smart-tv"&gt;Fire TV&lt;/a&gt; have all focused on those same European countries so far. Meanwhile in the US, TikTok released a more limited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357300/tiktok-amazon-fire-tv-app-launch-free-tv-mobile"&gt;“More on TikTok” app&lt;/a&gt; on Fire TV devices last year. We have followed up with both LG and TikTok to ask which regions the new smart TV app will be available in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tomwXf"&gt;Considering how optimized TikTok is for portrait-orientated mobile viewing, it’s not going to look great on living room televisions. But TikTok is understood to be trying to reach a broader audience with its smart TV apps, as well as to tap into the higher advertising rates associated with TV viewing, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/sponsored-content/hire-reskill-or-upskill-a-guide-to-smarter-skill-development"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1WkHE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 5:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with confirmed regions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Search adds guitar tuner to its smorgasbord of built-in features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjRpA6VKypAoobgoYzGOIW4Ifh0=/0x0:661x441/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967931/xD2C8Qsdpb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You play a note, and the software tells you whether you’re in tune.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9aWmrb"&gt;Google Search now has a handy built-in tuner, letting you use the microphone on your phone or computer to tune a guitar, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-search-has-an-instrument-tuner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. To access the feature, which was added this week, just search for “&lt;a href="https://g.co/kgs/qjLuJT"&gt;Google tuner&lt;/a&gt;.” The interface is similar to the dozens of guitar tuning apps that are already available. You play a string on the guitar, and Google will detect the note you’re aiming for, and tell you to “tune up” or “tune down” as required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJ7QJP"&gt;Like other guitar tuning apps, the effectiveness of Google’s tuner seems to depend a lot on the hardware you’re using it with. My iPhone 12 Pro (via Safari) or Windows desktop with a Blue Snowball USB microphone (via Edge) had no trouble hearing and helping me tune an unamplified electric guitar, but a more affordable Android device I’m currently reviewing (with Chrome) couldn’t pick it up at all. Your mileage may vary, basically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpKSVFR_7Am1wHRMaTxhXum1OeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909685/IMG_1534.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8rphDVZZhcvMhXFfaeVr0QOdtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909684/IMG_1533.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Google.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tune down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XAWZjX"&gt;Like most other guitar tuner apps, I don’t think Google Search’s feature is going to kill off the market for dedicated hardware tuners from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.korg.com/uk/products/tuners/ca_1/index.php"&gt;Korg&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.boss.info/uk/products/tu-3/"&gt;Boss&lt;/a&gt;. It’s too reliant on the quality of the mic in your device, and there’s no way to easily plug in an electric guitar to avoid having to worry about background noise. But if you need to tune up in a pinch, Google Search now has you covered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OLED Nintendo Switch doesn’t have a Pentile screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RXT95KwiEb_Qu9C1Iqg2_-V2oP0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967929/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6gOPi"&gt;The new Nintendo Switch OLED Model doesn’t have a Pentile screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIRMXb"&gt;That might not mean much to you, and it wasn’t something we were able to confirm definitively during our review process — other than to say that the screen is a huge improvement. Which it is. But there’s been speculation ever since the OLED Switch was announced that its panel might use Pentile technology, which could have had big implications for image quality. Nintendo devices don’t tend to have the best screens, after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ct3roe"&gt;Pentile is a trademark owned by Samsung that refers to various subpixel matrix layouts most commonly used in OLED display panels. In casual conversation, or as casual as conversations about OLED subpixel layouts can really be, Pentile is now essentially shorthand for “not full RGB,” meaning that red, green, and blue subpixels are shared between pixels rather than each pixel having all three colors itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QwAIdM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d1rPz5"&gt;Almost all OLED screens in portable consumer devices use some form of Pentile subpixel layout these days. The benefit of Pentile displays is that they’re cheaper to produce and can last longer. The downside is that they’re functionally lower resolution than an equivalent screen with an RGB stripe, which means you can sometimes see artifacts like dithering and graininess, particularly in high-contrast situations like reading text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRIwGi"&gt;The effect lessens as pixel density increases. Personally, Pentile stopped bothering me on phones when 1080p OLED displays became commonplace, which is to say that I didn’t like the Galaxy S III’s panel but was fine with the Galaxy S4. A 7-inch 720p Pentile screen on a Switch, then, would probably have been an problem. And Nintendo is not known for securing the best screen technologies for its devices — witness the 3DS, where some models randomly came with much better IPS screens than the regular TN LCD panels, with no indication as to which you’d get until you opened the box — so there was reasonable cause for concern over the Switch OLED Model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQE7mz"&gt;Well, turns out there’s no need to worry. My personal OLED Switch preorder just arrived, so of course the first thing I did with it was take a macro photo. Here’s what the screen looks like up close:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YLqZn_tqro3VqIFYk6Yr1l3w9LQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909635/IMG20211008145132_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A macro photo of the OLED Switch’s display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HG0FfF"&gt;This is a white area of the screen, so all the subpixels are lit up. The layout is actually a little unusual, with columns of blue subpixels next to smaller, alternating red and green ones rather than arranging them in uniform RGB lines. &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/10896/the-apple-watch-series-2-review/3"&gt;The Apple Watch does something similar&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m not sure what the advantages of this layout are — it presumably relates to the relative efficiency of each color. But what matters is that as you can see, each and every individual pixel is made up of a single red, green, and blue subpixel, or in other words you’re looking at a full RGB display with the same resolution for all three colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWdV74"&gt;For comparison, here’s the iPhone 13 Pro:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SsOz-jbv-GG2Phre_pUOKLJo6H8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909650/IMG20211008152015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A macro photo of the iPhone 13 Pro’s display.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5OYYGV"&gt;You can see how the subpixels are arranged in a complex diamond layout, alternating blue and green on one line and red and green on the next. On displays like this, each pixel is comprised of fewer subpixels compared to LCDs and RGB OLEDs that reserve three specific subpixels for each pixel in the screen — the “green resolution” is actually higher than the other two colors. As I said before, it’s not really an issue on devices with such sharp panels, but the image quality can break down when pixels are visible to the naked eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ALMDS"&gt;It’s not necessarily a big surprise that the new Switch went with RGB — the original PS Vita had an RGB-stripe OLED display ten years ago — but you never know with Nintendo. There just aren’t that many 720p OLED displays of this size these days, or RGB OLED displays in general, so it was certainly an open question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ra32WY"&gt;Anyway, glad to clear that up. Now I’m off to play &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SVP of Android offers open invitation to help Apple put RCS texting on the iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside The Samsung Electronics Co. Unpacked Product Launch Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eQL9Bb5kUymvqQoti8MsQwG4MQ=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967396/1200178032.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HlGXtY"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953"&gt;tweet earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, Google SVP Hiroshi Lockheimer called on Apple to support RCS, the next-generation texting standard that’s supposed to supplant SMS. He offered an “open invitation to the folks who can make this right” and said “we are here to help.” Translation: the “folks” are Apple and “we are here to help” is Google’s offer to assist Apple in implementing the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eefiaP"&gt;RCS is finally starting to gain traction around the world. Its biggest champion has been Google, which finally landed on using it as the default texting solution for Android phones after trying every other solution. RCS is far from perfect, but it’s clearly superior to SMS (which is, of course, a low bar). After securing deals from US carriers to commit to the standard in the next year, Google is setting its sights on a new target for evangelism: Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k633wL"&gt;Apple has yet to reply with comment to any inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over several years on whether it intends to support RCS on the iPhone, and declined to comment on this story. It seems unlikely that RCS is coming to iOS anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EXREhk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Group chats don't need to break this way. There exists a Really Clear Solution. Here's an open invitation to the folks who can make this right: we are here to help.    &lt;a href="https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0"&gt;https://t.co/4P6xfsQyT0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hiroshi Lockheimer (@lockheimer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lockheimer/status/1446193676883922953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60ao87"&gt;Lockheimer’s tweet followed a cheeky chain of tweets that started with a &lt;a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/bryson-dechambeau-iphone-ryder-cup-grouptext?utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=golfdigest"&gt;story about how pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau was breaking iMessage group chats with his green bubbles&lt;/a&gt;, which led to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Android/status/1446182495846912006"&gt;official Android account cringingly&lt;/a&gt; drawing a parallel between green bubbles and the &lt;a href="https://www.golfmonthly.com/tour/us-masters/masters-history-records/masters-green-jacket-126753"&gt;famous Masters green jacket&lt;/a&gt;. Lockheimer jokes that there is a “Really Clear Solution” (RCS) to group chats not breaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JKQVLi"&gt;RCS has had a long, convoluted (and unfinished) slog towards becoming the default texting experience on Android. Beginning in March 2021, Google began securing deals from US carriers to get them to commit to using Google’s Android Messages app as the default on all Android phones sold on their networks. It started with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356918/t-mobile-google-android-services-rcs-youtube-tv-pixel-storage-backup"&gt;blockbuster deal with T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, followed later by smaller deals with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556686/att-android-phones-rcs-google-messages"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584443/verizon-android-messages-rcs"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;. Once all those deals are implemented, Android users who text each other will switch over to RCS, which supports typing indicators, better group chats, and bigger multimedia messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV52C7"&gt;Importantly, RCS on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574451/android-rcs-encryption-message-end-to-end-beta"&gt;Android Messages also supports end-to-end encryption for one-on-one chats&lt;/a&gt;. That will mean Android users texting each other will have a higher level of privacy and security than when they text iPhone users — and vice versa. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713543/syniverse-hack-five-years-text-messages"&gt;recent hack on SMS company Syniverse&lt;/a&gt; is just the latest example of why encryption is important in messaging — especially for the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XwXfhp"&gt;RCS has problems of its own, though. As with iMessage, it’s possible for messages to get lost in limbo when switching phones. It’s also a standard that is championed by Google but theoretically agreed upon by carriers around the world. The association with Google has tainted RCS in the eyes of many, and of course requiring carriers to agree on anything is a recipe for problems. There are also technical limitations, as &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/7/"&gt;Ron Amadeo explains here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvu6A5"&gt;Nevertheless, it seems inevitable that RCS will replace SMS eventually — but only if Apple decides to support it. As more carriers adopt it and as more users realize that SMS is inherently less secure, Apple could begin to feel enough pressure to adopt RCS. Thus far, however, it hasn’t shown any signs of that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says its auto livestream captions are now available for all creators</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QGiguxru9rzApZKuJIVKuBLCoGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967245/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDQTa4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en"&gt;YouTube has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its automatic livestream captions should now be available for all creators, instead of being &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-live-stream-videos"&gt;limited to channels with more than 1,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; like they were during the feature’s initial rollout. This change, along with some future improvements the company details in its blog, should help make the platform more accessible to deaf or hard-of-hearing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxXkcE"&gt;Some of those updates include making live auto captions available to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6373554?hl=en#zippy=%2Cautomatic-captions-on-long-form-videos-and-shorts"&gt;12 more languages instead of just English&lt;/a&gt; (including Japanese, Turkish, and Spanish), the ability to add multiple audio tracks to a video to support multiple languages (and audio descriptions for those with limited eyesight), and the expansion of the auto-translate captions feature to support mobile devices, too. The expanded language support for live and auto-translate captions will be coming within the next few months, and YouTube says multiple audio tracks will be more widely available “in the coming quarters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7CSdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Auto-translate captions and searchable transcripts are also features making their way from desktop to mobile&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrB8eQ"&gt;YouTube also says that it’ll “experiment” with letting users search through video transcripts on mobile devices. For me, this has been an extremely useful feature on desktop — clicking the three dot icon to the right of the like/dislike bar, then hitting “Open transcript” to get a full searchable text of the video has saved me countless hours, so it’s nice to see that it could be coming to mobile as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJwELm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube has yet to release a replacement for community captions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vefgCR"&gt;Finally, YouTube says it’s still working on the Subtitle Editor permission, and that it’ll provide updates on its progress “in the coming months.” The feature, which will let creators designate other people to add subtitles to their videos, was meant to replace the community captions feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349401/youtube-community-captions-deaf-creators-accessibility-google"&gt;that YouTube removed&lt;/a&gt;. Without being able to rely on volunteers for captions and translations, creators who wanted to make their videos more accessible &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22443577/youtube-captions-increased-deaf-campaigners"&gt;have had to scramble to create their own systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California just made it a lot harder for companies to cover up harassment and abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Gov. Gavin Newsom School Visit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VWwBOsB4DtGhshUdVYoUxv5duU4=/0x117:4770x3297/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69967179/1340672342.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g7QrLr"&gt;California governor Gavin Newsom signed the &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331"&gt;Silenced No More Act&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday night— a historic piece of legislation, authored by state senator Connie Leyva (D-Chino), that should protect workers who speak out about harassment and discrimination even if they’ve signed a non-disclosure agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCZO2G"&gt;Pinterest whistleblower Ifeoma Ozoma began &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;pushing the bill forward last year&lt;/a&gt;, after coming forward with allegations of racism against the tech company. She knew she was partially protected by the Stand Together Against Non-Disclosures Act, a Me Too-era law that banned NDAs in sexual harassment cases, but soon realized the bill did not provide protections for other forms of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06SGwv"&gt;Now, that’s changing. Workers in California will be legally protected for speaking out about discrimination based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age. &lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220SB331&amp;amp;showamends=false"&gt;You can see the changes in detail here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WF7lRv"&gt;The law could have enormous implications for the tech industry, which is famous for having workers sign extremely restrictive NDAs. While it will only protect employees in California, Ozoma has plans to expand it to other parts of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0YG38"&gt;The bill is sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association, Ozoma’s organization Earthseed, and Equal Rights Advocates. It will take effect on January 1st, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoOi5Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382148/pinterest-silenced-no-more-act-sb331-discrimination-harassment"&gt;Pinterest agreed to proactively stop making workers sign NDAs&lt;/a&gt; that kept them from discussing “their personal experiences at Pinterest” back in April, after Ozoma’s accusations but months ahead of the law’s passage. Apple, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22661536/apple-shareholder-resolution-change-nda-harassment-discrimination"&gt;refused to add language to its employment agreements&lt;/a&gt; to make it clear that employees could discuss workplace harassment and discrimination, after activists and Apple shareholders pressured the company with a shareholder resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
