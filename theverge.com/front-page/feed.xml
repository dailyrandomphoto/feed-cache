    <title>Peloton is spending millions to fix its months-long shipping delays</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tBcXGP"&gt;Laura Sneade Jordan’s Peloton journey sounds like many others’. She and her husband had been thinking about buying the company’s connected bike throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, but they finally decided to buy the $1,895 machine at the end of November in order to have it by Christmas. When they ordered, Peloton said the bike would show up on January 12th — after Christmas, but close enough, they figured. They bought themselves cycling shoes while they waited the seven weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZEy04"&gt;But five days before the set delivery date, Peloton emailed the couple a generic message to say they’d have to keep waiting. The bike had been delayed by seven weeks. The company hasn’t offered them a discount or even a thorough explanation for a delay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMz8T0"&gt;“For the amount of money you’re spending,” she says, the delay felt like an “F you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFE0AC"&gt;In Peloton’s lightning in a bottle of a year, it hasn’t been able to keep up with demand, and customers are angry. Reports of months-long delays are spilling out onto social media, inundating Twitter and Peloton’s official Facebook group with complaints. Other customers are taking to Peloton’s Instagram comments to vent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQf652"&gt;“Canceled our bike due to long delays,” one person wrote. “Would not recommend Peloton. Bad customer service, and constant shipping delays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gsnu5s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;People are experiencing months-long delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kK1Zey"&gt;Last month,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/business/peloton-slow-delivery.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on the issue with a Peloton spokesperson telling the paper the “vast majority” of orders had been delivered on time. The company didn’t provide percentages, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNxzCs"&gt;Part of the problem is Peloton mainly manufactures in Taiwan, a long way away from its US market. And, of course, people are looking for ways to work out at home more than ever before because of the pandemic and stay-at-home orders. The company’s quarterly revenue reached an all-time high of $1 billion this most recent quarter with its total members reaching 4.4 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GB9BPS"&gt;Still, Peloton acknowledged the delays in its earnings report yesterday, saying it was carrying orders over into the next quarter, which were supposed to be delivered already. The company says it remains “inventory constrained with longer than acceptable wait times for the delivery of our products,” and it’s investing more than $100 million in air freight and expedited ocean freight over the next six months to remedy the situation. The company says it’s “hopeful that an acceleration in vaccine distribution and the broader opening of our economy will provide a tailwind to our efforts over the coming months,” although of course, when gyms reopen, the company will face even stronger competition. The company also says it’s now manufacturing more bikes every month than it did in all of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n8DZf7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Peloton says it manufactures more bikes in a month now than it did in all of 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFlM3i"&gt;As part of its solution, Peloton also &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-signs-agreement-acquire-precor"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; fitness equipment manufacturer Precor late last year in an attempt to speed up its manufacturing process and bring it stateside. The deal gave Peloton 625,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity along with in-house tooling and fabrication capabilities, product development, and the chance to do quality assurance check, according to the press release. The company would finally start making its connected equipment in the country where it sells most of the units, allowing for faster delivery, although Peloton only said this would likely start “before the end of the calendar year 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jT3YB9"&gt;Ryan Lashley, another Peloton customer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he ordered the bike in late October with a quoted eight-week wait time. He aimed to get his order in ahead of the Christmas rush, he says. He sold his rowing machine to make room for the bike, and, as evidence of the demand in home workout solutions, it sold in five minutes on Facebook Marketplace, he says, leaving him without a way to work out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4OL9o"&gt;The day before his bike was set to be delivered, January 13th, XPO Logistics, which fulfills some of Peloton’s orders, told Lashley his delivery needed to be rescheduled. Now it wouldn’t show up until April 3rd. This was the first message he received from any entity related to Peloton since placing his order. He tried calling the company’s customer service line for more info and got nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CszYkx"&gt;“The whole season of having this thing through the winter is going to be gone by the time it gets here,” he says, adding that there’s a 50 / 50 chance he’ll end up keeping his order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfApIr"&gt;Another person &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; messaged said they gave up on their Peloton order and instead bought SoulCycle’s similar connected bike. Peloton knows fulfillment is an issue, and it’s racing against the pandemic clock because once everyone’s vaccinated, people might end up wanting to leave their homes and get back to the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taL5EO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Alix Diaconis creates video for The Verge</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00CpL9YvWznOw09Is7bUMRduyHo=/0x169:4048x2868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773904/Image_from_iOS.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phil Esposito / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ao3pDy"&gt;Along with news, features, opinions, and tech reviews, video has become an increasingly important part of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s content. But to make great, involving videos, you’ve got to have staff with the expertise to create that video — along with the tools that allow those staff members to let their imaginations soar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWK3Sh"&gt;Alix Diaconis is one of the directors who helps make video magic for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. We talked to Alix about what she does and what tools she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2ZXOKX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10316346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIuV4k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alix, what do you do for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4H43mc"&gt;I’m one of the video directors for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. I get to work every day with my three co-workers (but really, friends) to create the videos on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s YouTube channel. Sometimes deadlines are &lt;em&gt;fast &lt;/em&gt;because tech and news are fast, but our team has been working together for years, so even live events feel seamless and fun. We each shoot, take photos, and edit; then the video gets treated by our sound and graphics wizards. Then bam, on to the next one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msKJVM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What hardware and software tools are needed to produce a video for a site like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKEpJZ"&gt;It really varies video to video. For some videos, we’ll pull out all the stops, while for others, we need to do quick and light. Heck, I think we’ve shot videos with just a GoPro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhZNZi"&gt;When we go to a press event, we’ll keep it very light with a monopod, lavalier microphone, and a camera we feel most comfortable with. And then I’ll edit at the event on my MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WNKrR"&gt;But most of the time when we’re shooting on location, we’ll bring a bigger kit with an HD monitor, a slider (which helps you do tracking shots), maybe a drone. And when we’re making the big stuff, like a flagship phone review, we like to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20870258/apple-iphone-11-pro-review-video-motion-graphics-how-workflow-editing"&gt;bring out everything&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/8/2/17644446/macro-lens-camera-venus-optics-kickstarter"&gt;a probe lens&lt;/a&gt; like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Dvenus%2520optics%2520laowa%252024mm%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dps&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22262302%2Fvideo-tools-canon-amd-adobe-gopro-youtube-the-verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venus Optics Laowa&lt;/a&gt; to make intro shots like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="62EMzg"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Samsung Galaxy Fold review: after the break|66055" data-volume-uuid="3a55f01ac" data-volume-id="66055" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-80" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;The opening shot on this video was created using a probe lens.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PFaim5"&gt;Since we’re uploading videos for our job, good internet upload speeds make life a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; easier. We also have a shared server so we have access to our terabytes and terabytes of footage at all times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDNuqf"&gt;Oh, and also teamwork. Lots and lots of teamwork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZo32y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What specific hardware tools do you use for your work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXn6Ej"&gt;For shooting, I prefer to use the Canon EOS C200 — I think it looks really cinematic — and my preferred lens is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Canon-70-200mm-Lens-Digital-Cameras/dp/B07DFSNT1D?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=37701b54458cc6a1956a4c19bf410db5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Canon EF 70-200mm&lt;/a&gt; (for B-roll at least). Sometimes I’ll use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/11/9310469/sony-a7s-ii-mirrorless-camera-4k"&gt;Sony A7S II&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21341095/sony-a7s-mark-iii-camera-video-price-specs-features"&gt;III&lt;/a&gt;, which looks extra crisp, but I’m not a big fan of Sony menus. For sound, I’ll typically use a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-EW-112P-omni-directional-system/dp/B002CWQTXG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=fe42e38308756c6152a01cbf7a266ad1&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser G3 lavalier&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-H6-Six-Track-Portable-Recorder/dp/B00DFU9BRK?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=051ebf1e10d363b11eb9e0c134215c5d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom H6 recorder&lt;/a&gt;. For photos, I use the Canon 50D.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fveK21"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10316464" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IgVwXo"&gt;For post-production in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; offices, I would edit on a 27-inch iMac, which is due for an upgrade. At home, though, I have a more powerful editing PC that my producer built for me. It has an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-3700X-16-Thread-Processor/dp/B07SXMZLPK?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=dd66f37d8875e942b1bc864f7675edec&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AMD Ryzen 7 3700X&lt;/a&gt; 8-core processor, 2TB NVMe drive, a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731362988670487733" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Radeon RX 580 series video card&lt;/a&gt;, 32GB RAM, and an &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/484013/asus-vp28uqg-28-4k-uhd-60hz-hdmi-dp-freesync-gaming-led-monitor"&gt;Asus 28-inch 4K display&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, there are always technical issues — it’s part of editing — but the PC is the best editing machine I’ve personally owned. (Thank you, Phil!) I do miss the beautiful iMac display though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeimUX"&gt;Also, since video takes up a lot of space, I’ll sometimes use an additional &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SSK-Aluminum-Enclosure-Adapter-External/dp/B07MNFH1PX?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=56190d64b6cff7e17d117d7df71909b3&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD&lt;/a&gt; for projects. And as for headphones, I use the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-MDR7506-Professional-Diaphragm-Headphone/dp/B000AJIF4E?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a2401c8f44d23af012e7945d087c6112&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony MDR-7506&lt;/a&gt;, which are the only headphones I can wear comfortably all day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZqHKY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10316500"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2cvq9"&gt;And then there’s the fun, random gear: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO8-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/dp/B07WSRXMS8?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5410129105677bd1e9d53593f4df2fdd&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero 8&lt;/a&gt;, an Insta360 panoramic video camera (which we recently used for this e-bike video), a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zhiyun-Crane-Bluetooth-Stabilizer-Mirrorless/dp/B01F53XB8Y?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ceacd90ff4afe1de972afd635542c09c&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zhiyun Crane&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-Mavic-Pro-Smart-Controller-dp-B07TKZ565D/dp/B07TKZ565D?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9fa5c0633a3a23af8986342149528454&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DJI Mavic Pro drone&lt;/a&gt;... and whatever else we can get our hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7kvwig"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Harley Davidson Serial 1 Cycle|99779" data-volume-uuid="465227760" data-volume-id="99779" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-754" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;This video was created using an Insta360 panoramic video camera.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="sPBnQB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xgPiVE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What software tools do you use for your work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLO6pI"&gt;All Adobe everything. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fpremiere.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22262302%2Fvideo-tools-canon-amd-adobe-gopro-youtube-the-verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt; for editing, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Faftereffects.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22262302%2Fvideo-tools-canon-amd-adobe-gopro-youtube-the-verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;After Effects&lt;/a&gt; for basic graphics, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fphotoshop.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22262302%2Fvideo-tools-canon-amd-adobe-gopro-youtube-the-verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; for the video thumbnails. You can do a lot in Premiere, but it does have its bugs, and it’s not always optimized for Apple’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQ0481"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What tools do you use for your own projects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gs8YUa"&gt;I’ve been teaching myself &lt;a href="https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/"&gt;DaVinci Resolve&lt;/a&gt; to color footage. I still barely understand the program, but it makes footage look 100x better than coloring it in Premiere. And purely for fun, I shoot 35mm film on my dad’s old Minolta camera.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alNmX2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What hardware and software tools would you recommend for somebody just starting out?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwncI0"&gt;Premiere is very common for editing. But if you want to try something free and you have an iPhone or iPad, there’s the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725"&gt;Splice&lt;/a&gt; app. It’s really intuitive, but you’re limited to clips you have on your device. There’s also DaVinci Resolve, which is free and as advanced as most paid editing softwares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRVrKD"&gt;As for cameras, just get one that you feel comfortable using! And for a computer, invest in a good one if you see yourself editing for a long time; iMacs and Windows PCs are both good, and the specs will just depend on how big your projects will be. I haven’t had a chance to use Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; yet, but both seem like good choices if you’d prefer a laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2JrQKe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="UGixkn"&gt;A remake of the Nintendo 64 classic &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; has leaked online, and it’s playable on PC using an emulator, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/goldeneyes-xbox-remaster-has-leaked-online-and-its-fully-playable-on-pc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video Games Chronicle &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The game, which was originally destined for the Xbox 360’s Live Arcade service, includes the original single-player campaign, as well as local split-screen multiplayer, but online multiplayer and leaderboards are reportedly missing. The whole package has received a graphical overhaul, but players can switch back to the original graphics with a button-press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hybZwk"&gt;The remake was never released, after it was canceled back in 2008 as it neared completion. According to a &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140203220326/http://www.1up.com/news/goldeneye-xbla-stall"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;1Up &lt;/em&gt;at the time&lt;/a&gt; which has now been corroborated by &lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt;, the issue came down to the sheer number of rights-holders for the game. This included not just Nintendo (publisher of the N64 original), and Microsoft (owner of Rare, the original game’s developer), but also Bond-license holders Eon Productions, as well as the actors whose likenesses appeared in the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWaJFs"&gt;Footage of the remake has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/24/12620640/goldeneye-007-xbox-remake-video"&gt;surfaced before&lt;/a&gt;, including a two-hour gameplay video that emerged &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-30-cancelled-goldeneye-007-xbla-remaster-revealed-in-full-with-2-hour-playthrough-video"&gt;just last month&lt;/a&gt;, but now the single-player campaign and local multiplayer game is playable for anyone who’s able to find a copy of the ROM on file-sharing sites and configure an Xbox 360 emulator (&lt;a href="https://xenia.jp/"&gt;Xenia is apparently&lt;/a&gt; the way to go here). But if that sounds like too much effort, then &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJm8WETXLZ0&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;this livestream&lt;/a&gt; from Digital Foundry offers a great overview of the contents of the remaster: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SfQVDs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJm8WETXLZ0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suHeUh"&gt;Although this specific &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; remaster was never released, there are a host of other related projects that saw the light of day over the years. While the complexities of the Bond license may have prevented Rare from remaking &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;, it &lt;em&gt;was &lt;/em&gt;eventually able to release a remake of its spiritual successor, &lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark, &lt;/em&gt;on Xbox Live Arcade back in 2010. &lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt; was a similar style of game to &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye,&lt;/em&gt; and ran on an upgraded version of its engine, but was based on an original IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5mkjeW"&gt;Meanwhile, a separate &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; remake was eventually developed by Activision (which held the rights to develop and publish Bond games between 2006 and 2013) and released for the Wii in 2010 (it was ported to the Xbox 360 and PS3 the following year). This remake was &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-02-goldeneye-007-review.html"&gt;generally well received&lt;/a&gt;, but it bore little relation to the N64 original. At the time, many remarked that it felt more like a &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; game that also happened to be based on the 1995 Bond film, rather than a remake of the 1997 game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPDStw"&gt;Away from official projects, there have also been a number of attempts at fan-made remakes of &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 007&lt;/em&gt; over the years. &lt;a href="https://geshl2.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoldenEye: Source&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was a remake of the original game’s multiplayer made in Valve’s Source engine (it’s available to download &lt;a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/goldeneye-source/downloads/ges-v506-full-installer-exe"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), while &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye 25&lt;/em&gt; was an attempt to rebuild the original game’s campaign in Unreal Engine 4 that was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-11-after-years-of-development-the-goldeneye-25-fan-remake-just-got-lawyered"&gt;shut down last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome 88 update includes important security fix for zero-day vulnerability  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YMd5QIBS2SglZ4P6hzbuNrAJEY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773554/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJeGaw"&gt;It’s more important than usual to update to the latest version of Chrome. &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/02/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_4.html"&gt;Version 88.0.4324.150&lt;/a&gt; of Google’s browser released on Thursday fixes a vulnerability which the search giant says is actively being exploited in the wild. The update is rolling out now across Windows, Mac, and Linux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a98BeO"&gt;Google isn’t providing specific details about the CVE-2021-21148 vulnerability “until a majority of users are updated with a fix.” But &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-patches-an-actively-exploited-chrome-zero-day/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the date Google says the bug was reported on (January 24th) is just one day before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250060/google-threat-analysis-group-north-korean-hackers-cybersecurity-researchers-social-engineering"&gt;Google’s Threat Analysis Group publicly disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a hacking campaign that appeared to be relying, in part, on an unpatched vulnerability in Chrome. It said government-backed hackers based in North Korea had set up a blog to lure their targets to, which would infect their machines even if they were running fully-patched software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKBeVX"&gt;Regardless of the exact bug being patched, it’s more important than usual to ensure you’re running the latest version of Chrome. Although the browser’s update process is basically automatic, you can accelerate things and force an update in the “About Google Chrome” menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOVksQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s new concept phone has a waterfall display on all four edges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgGTlMqtQwPXYx4fLZv56jPtFZo=/0x0:1800x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773384/EtcXdw7VoAEVfih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jK59Er"&gt;Xiaomi has &lt;a href="https://blog.mi.com/en/2021/02/05/xiaomi-debuts-its-first-quad-curved-waterfall-display-concept-smartphone/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its latest phone concept: a “quad-curved waterfall display.” This means that the unnamed phone’s screen not only has deep 88-degree “waterfall” curves on the left and right sides, but on the top and bottom as well, leaving no room for ports or buttons. Xiaomi says this is intended to “extend the limits of the display to infinity” and enable “a true, port-free unibody design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8of3rK"&gt;The obvious question is how that could possibly work at the screen’s corners, and based on the promotional imagery it looks like Xiaomi is simply leaving them blank with small, rounded cutouts. Not quite infinity, then, but still a neat trick — although for people who already don’t like the comparatively modest curved displays on phones like the Galaxy S21 Ultra, this sounds like their nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbxKUBgz5BU8XR-wBqxC5EDGuI4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283412/mi.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bsJheq"&gt;Announcing a concept device entirely through renders doesn’t quite have the impact of showing it off in person, as was common pre-COVID. A Xiaomi representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this phone does actually exist and that they’ve used it themselves, for what that’s worth. The display is the result of “countless breakthroughs in glass bending and laminating technology,” according to Xiaomi, and “represents the sum of 46 groundbreaking patents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IO23F"&gt;This concept phone follows last week’s announcement of seemingly outlandish Xiaomi tech, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255625/xiaomi-mi-air-charge-technology-wireless-charging"&gt;“Mi Air Charge” truly wireless charging system&lt;/a&gt;. And back in 2019, Xiaomi revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/24/20881378/xiaomi-mi-mix-alpha-announced-wrap-around-screen"&gt;the Mi Mix Alpha phone&lt;/a&gt;, which featured a display that wrapped around almost the entire device, though it ultimately never went on sale. This latest concept may well never make it into a commercially available device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57Ycd"&gt;Xiaomi will announce global availability for its considerably more conventional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202973/xiaomi-mi-11-flagship-announced-chinese-variant"&gt;Mi 11 flagship phone&lt;/a&gt; at an event next Monday, February 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qesDBfRl8uxcnh9I5VpOAtCo-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283414/EtcOaq7VcAA9Xkm_1.jpeg"&gt;

    <title>Baltimore’s spy planes will fly no more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XxMc9XQ5pdX2Vmg2khZTfL_gAOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68773308/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ufzLWv"&gt;Baltimore, Maryland city officials have unanimously voted to end the city police department’s spy plane surveillance program, &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/88ab8b/baltimore-has-officially-ended-its-creepy-spy-plane-program"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Sorry, wait, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) had a spy plane program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jg7x59"&gt;Yes, and it was called AIR, which stands for Aerial Investigation Research. The program was run by a company called Persistent Surveillance Systems (super friendly name), and it used airplanes and high-resolution cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/aug/24/baltimore-police-aerial-surveillance-cameras#maincontent"&gt;to capture what was happening in a 32-mile square mile area of the city&lt;/a&gt;. It also started out as a secret, with the police department paying for it not with city funds, which would be subject to public scrutiny, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/9a3nyp/baltimore-police-cant-explain-why-their-all-seeing-spy-planes-were-kept-secret"&gt;but with funding from two Texas billionaires&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQnhYp"&gt;The BPD admitted to using planes to spy on Baltimore’s residents back in 2016, managed to approve a six-month pilot program last year, and kept flying until October 31st, according to the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;. In April, the ACLU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215090/aclu-aerial-surveillance-baltimore-police-department-pss-lawsuit"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to challenge the constitutionality of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vCJG4I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Convenient timing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gi4mNj"&gt;That lawsuit is set to be moved into appeals court next month, and the city is going to be required to testify. According to the &lt;em&gt;Sun&lt;/em&gt;, the Acting City Solicitor (read: the city’s legal advisor) said the city plans to argue there’s no point in continuing the lawsuit, as the program has been officially shut down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3yCk"&gt;The ACLU, on the other hand, isn’t planning to give up. &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-comment-city-baltimore-terminating-aerial-surveillance-program-contract"&gt;In a statement&lt;/a&gt;, a senior staff attorney with ACLU Maryland said that “We plan to ensure that the case is heard,” adding that “the law is clear that the city can’t intentionally duck accountability by suddenly bailing on its years-long defense of this technology on the eve of next month’s appeals court hearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziLdNb"&gt;Needless to say, regardless of the court case’s outcome, it’s probably a good thing that the program is gone. Police department officials argued that the program kept citizens’ privacy in mind, and was only used in a limited way, tracing individuals from known crime scenes, but independent evaluators hired by the city &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpjqd/baltimore-police-lied-about-almost-every-aspect-of-its-spy-plane-program"&gt;said that those claims were lies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBlUZS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/politics/bs-md-pol-plane-canceled-20210203-ha3ixtgiyfg4rpgmfftrsd6uwu-story.html"&gt;Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott said&lt;/a&gt; that the city is “building a full strategy around public safety ... not gimmicks.” Perhaps he should add “and not mass surveillance” to that as well. Regardless, the city plans to keep 15 percent of the data for ongoing criminal investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Huntsman V2 Analog is the latest keyboard built to mimic a controller’s joysticks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PMSfVGHNLrq43a7f7f0rbLIBzpM=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772647/huntsmanv2analoghero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4zGsLV"&gt;Razer’s latest mechanical keyboard, the $250 Huntsman V2 Analog, looks similar to the company’s previous models, but the biggest differences lie in the switches. This model’s optical switches support adjustable actuation (the amount of movement required to register a press), allowing for near-endless customization through Razer’s Synapse software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LdSJW"&gt;Perhaps the most appealing feature of these keys is that, instead of being limited to the usual on / off nature of key actuation, they can be programmed with analog inputs to emulate a controller’s joysticks for smoother, variable levels of movement and control. You’ll be able to program the keyboard so that pressing a key down slightly will make you walk slowly in game, while pressing it fully will have you running at a normal clip — just like an analog stick.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTwTmc"&gt;(Note that game support for using analog inputs and a mouse simultaneously will vary, but using this feature at all requires the Synapse software. And programming an analog input for a key will override its original use case, so you’ll need to revert it or flip to a different profile.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWVYKG"&gt;Building on that feature, Razer’s keyboard also allows gamers to program two distinct functions that would usually require two buttons onto one key, with one firing off at one actuation distance and the other when you fully press the key. You could equip a grenade with a soft press of a key, then throw it by pushing the key all the way down, just to give an example.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F3ypM7jHgE1ruPKQ2qdFGSE6Ec8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278985/huntsmanv2analog1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8W79y"&gt;In fact, Razer’s switches can be customized to your specific actuation preferences for gaming or any other use case. The Huntsman V2 Analog keys have a default 3.6mm travel, but you can adjust the distance to a much shorter 1.5mm or anywhere between those values. It’s important to note that this doesn’t change how the keys feel when you push them, but a shorter actuation will let you type a little softer without worrying that your keys won’t register a press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nPtIH"&gt;This is how it works: instead of relying on separate physical mechanisms to delineate between actuation states, the switch’s sensor judges distance pressed by assessing the amount of infrared light hitting it. The embedded animation shows this in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Huntsman V2 Analog" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPavGoMSphz2GbTOi6Je40BBVwc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278987/Razer_Analog_Optical_Switch_Actuation_with_Bar.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at how the optical switch determines the actuation level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XtPK2H"&gt;Razer’s Huntsman V2 Analog has an aluminum frame, a set of dedicated buttons to control media, and a dial for adjusting volume, which all look and feel great. Razer includes Doubleshot PBT keycaps, which are said to wear better with age than standard keycaps, and you’ll also get a soft wrist rest that contains RGB lights and can be attached magnetically to the keyboard. As you might expect, the keyboard itself has bedazzling Chroma RGB lights all around it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4CPqS"&gt;The cable that powers the Huntsman V2 Analog is USB-C, but Razer includes an adapter so you can plug it into USB Type-A ports. And if you want to use the keyboard’s single USB 3.0 Type-A passthrough port for an accessory, it has a second USB Type-A cable hanging off its back that you can plug into your PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdCNwC"&gt;By the way, in case this is your first time hearing about this kind of analog key technology and adjustable actuation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/3/11850816/wooting-one-analog-mechanical-keyboard-computex"&gt;keyboard company Wooting&lt;/a&gt; beat Razer to the punch with similar keyboards dating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/1/11832654/wooting-analog-mechanical-keyboard-kickstarter"&gt;all the way back to 2016&lt;/a&gt;. That company’s current keyboards start at around $150, far less than Razer’s $250 Huntsman V2 Analog. Whether Razer’s model can justify its high price will depend on your thirst for Chroma RGB lights, dedicated media buttons, and optional USB-C connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgkuJl"&gt;The Huntsman V2 Analog is now available exclusively at &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=http%3A%2F%2FRazer.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; through February 9th, when it’ll launch at more retailers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer built a Thunderbolt 4 dock stuffed with ports and Chroma RGB lights</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCSmFVsFB6oxrj0i86eIMPmEEis=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68772644/razertb4dockhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 dock is littered with useful ports&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lG6Qy"&gt;If you’ve been hunting for a Thunderbolt 4 dock for your new laptop, Razer has a new option for you to consider, simply called the Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock. It’s loaded with ports, and of course, Chroma RGB lighting, too. Razer says it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18246182/usb-4-thunderbolt-3-specs-features-release-date"&gt;USB4&lt;/a&gt; compliant, so it’ll be compatible with the next wave of fast peripherals and devices. It’s available for preorder through Razer for $329.99, which seems competitive for what it offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cz0FXI"&gt;Taking a trip around this understated, matte black aluminum dock, its front hosts a fast UHS-II SD card slot, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a single Thunderbolt 4 port to plug straight into your computer. On the back is where you’ll find most of the ports, including a barrel jack for its 135W power source, three Thunderbolt 4 ports for connecting displays and accessories (including support for Razer’s Core X external graphics card enclosure), a Gigabit Ethernet port, and three USB Type-A 3.1 Gen 2 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Thunderbolt 4 Dock" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rhTna1tIDbDPyhkoe89krOghXNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278888/razertb4dock2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dock is 7.48 inches long, 2.93 inches wide, and just over an inch tall. It weighs three quarters of a pound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tXd9Bz"&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 Dock can deliver 90W PD charging to laptops, and if you plan to connect external monitors to it, it can support up to two 4K screens with a 60Hz refresh rate, or one 8K display at 30Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8bjqt"&gt;This dock is also compatible with Windows 10 laptops with Thunderbolt 3 ports, as well as recent MacBook Pro and Air models running macOS Big Sur and all of Apple’s M1-powered machines — all of which feature Thunderbolt 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssqsQs"&gt;Razer’s Thunderbolt 4 dock is almost a direct (but slightly more expensive) parallel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219031/kensingtons-sd5700t-thunderbolt-4-dock-90w-charging"&gt;the Kensington SD5700T dock that my colleague Monica Chin checked out&lt;/a&gt;. It’s $289.99 and features the same amount of Thunderbolt 4 ports, plus one extra USB Type-A port. Razer’s option is a little more slim, lightweight, and flashy with its LEDs, but only you will know if that’s worth $40 more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new betas let you try its Watch-based solution for masked iPhone unlocks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="5G is great if you can find it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQz6gAtygq2U54E2N1oDRkh2qbw=/555x228:2040x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771975/vpavic_4243_20201017_0216.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKHzoF"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;upcoming release of iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4&lt;/a&gt;, Apple will let you use your Apple Watch to authenticate and unlock your iPhone while you’re wearing a mask. But if you want to try the feature now, you can, as Apple has released public betas for both iOS 14.5 and watchOS 7.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luZbYl"&gt;Before these releases, people using iPhones with Face ID while wearing a mask could only unlock their phone by entering in their passcode manually, which can quickly become a hassle. But with the new updates installed, if your Apple Watch is unlocked (which it most likely is if it’s sitting on your wrist) and as long as it’s nearby, when you try to unlock your iPhone while wearing a mask, you’ll feel a little buzz from your Apple Watch and your iPhone should authenticate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ronwMa"&gt;There are a few caveats to this feature, though. It only works for unlocking your iPhone — it won’t work for authenticating things like App Store or Apple Pay purchases. And you’ll still have to manually enter your passcode on your iPhone every once in a while as an extra security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzSFvA"&gt;If you want to get the public betas to try the feature out, head over to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta program site&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you’ll need to install the iOS 14.5 beta first before you can install the watchOS 7.4 beta. And be warned that because this is beta software, you might run into unexpected bugs, crashes, and performance issues. Install with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford is more than doubling its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGpTkCCf6RneVUTJh7Otk6R3Ke8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771759/sokane_210125_4386_1753.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkFBfj"&gt;Ford is increasing its investment in electric and autonomous vehicles to $29 billion, the company’s top executives said in an earnings call Thursday. The automaker had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/15/16892386/ford-electric-car-11-billion-2022-detroit-auto-show-2018"&gt;previously committed to spend $11.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electrifying its vehicle lineup through 2022. Now, Ford says it will spend double that amount, while extending the timeline to 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCUVZg"&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones. That $22 billion includes $7 billion that the company has already spent since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OkBldR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The automaker will spend $7 billion on autonomous vehicles and $22 billion on electric ones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Jgfu"&gt;Ford said a majority of vehicles it plans on producing will be battery-electric vehicles, but the company also has hybrid and plug-in hybrid models that also have traditional internal combustion engines. The company introduced an all-electric Transit van last year, and plans on unveiling an electric version of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288000/ford-electric-f-150-2022-sale-launch-jim-farley"&gt;best-selling F-150 pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0i4V3"&gt;Ford’s new CEO Jim Farley touted the company’s increased investment as a “more aggressive” plan to position the nation’s oldest automaker as a leader in the future of mobility and transportation. Farley cited Ford’s recent announcement that it would work &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;with Google to integrate the tech giant’s Android software&lt;/a&gt; into “millions” of vehicles starting in 2023 as representative of the type of deals involved in Ford’s pivot to a more digital future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLXGDR"&gt;The increased investment is meant to convince those on Wall Street who have been jittery about Ford’s ability to catch up to Tesla, which has been the only automaker to successfully build an EV business over the last few years. Ford is keeping pace with other legacy automakers like GM and Volkswagen, having just begun delivering its hotly anticipated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt; to customers late last year — though a &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/ford/2021/01/16/ford-mustang-mach-e-delivery-delay/4189265001/"&gt;quality review issue&lt;/a&gt; delayed hundreds of additional deliveries last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qNEi2O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mustang Mach-E review: Ford’s big bet is about to pay off","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yr6bZS"&gt;Most of the big automakers have said in the past year that they plan on pivoting to all-electric lineups. Daimler AG, the parent company of Mercedes-Benz (Daimler itself is soon to be renamed Mercedes-Benz), said it will produce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267856/mercedes-benz-concept-eqa-frankfurt-showcase-mobility-plans"&gt;electrified versions of all of its cars by 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Volvo announced it would start to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/5/15921208/volvo-all-electric-by-2019"&gt;phase out gas-only&lt;/a&gt; car production in 2019, while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/11/16289292/vw-electrify-entire-300-car-lineup-2030"&gt;Volkswagen Group&lt;/a&gt; is going to make everything electric in some shape or form by 2030. And China’s rising prominence in the auto market, in addition to that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16379094/china-fossil-fuels-electric-vehicles"&gt;country’s restrictions&lt;/a&gt; on manufacturing fossil-fuel burning vehicles, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/8/16625938/ford-china-zotye-electric-cars-manufacturing"&gt;certainly putting pressure&lt;/a&gt; on the entire industry to go electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9KRvN"&gt;Ford isn’t even the only car maker to greatly increase its bet on electric. Late last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;GM said it would spend $27 billion&lt;/a&gt; on electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025 — up from the $20 billion it announced before the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
