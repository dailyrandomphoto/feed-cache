    <title>Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition review: an AMD powerhouse</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Strix G15 punches above its price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OnOztd"&gt;I was skeptical of the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition when I first got my test unit from AMD. While the frame rates the Radeon RX 6800M delivered were respectable, it wasn’t decisively outperforming comparable systems with Intel and Nvidia parts. I assumed that this gaming laptop would be fairly middle of the road, without many standout features to set it apart from the pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EPJw2"&gt;Then Asus gave me the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Strix logo on the bottom bezel of the ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRF9pwoAAmwXgvhxK8ICJ51csko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552467/mchin_20190821_4609_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here, have a Strix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jDzFWl"&gt;Well, the price range. Asus says the Strix G15 Advantage Edition will cost $1,549.99 to $1,699.99. Given that a regular Strix G15 with specs close to those of my test unit (an eight-core Ryzen 9 5900HX, 16GB of RAM, and a 300Hz 1080p screen, although with 1TB of storage) and an Nvidia RTX 3070 GPU is listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202102AM190000003/STRIX-ASUS-ROG-Strix-G15-%282021%29-Gaming-Laptop%2C-15.6%E2%80%9D-300Hz-IPS-Type-FHD-Display%2C-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3070%2C-AMD-Ryzen-R9-5900HX%2C-16GB-DDR4%2C-1TB-PCIe-NVMe-SSD%2C-RGB-Keyboard%2C-Windows-10%2C-G513QR-ES96"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, I’m assuming that my configuration will be close to the top of that range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJGeL5"&gt;Regardless, a Strix for $1,699.99 is a great value. This model is delivering better performance and better battery life than I’d expect to see from all kinds of gaming laptops that are hundreds of dollars more. Given the Strix’s flashy and decidedly enthusiast aesthetic, I think it makes a bit less sense as a value purchase than something like the Zephyrus G15. But, if you’re looking for a bold and garish gaming laptop that’s punching well above its price class, you’re probably in the target audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="umnE4F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10530834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YjyI64Cq2m35qIajk_Ta_U43ccA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552468/mchin_20190821_4609_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four-zone RGB.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9ve0lF"&gt;This Strix is one of the first laptops announced that includes AMD’s new RX &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/31/22457181/amd-radeon-rx-6000m-series-release-date-rdna2-rog-strix-g15"&gt;6000M series&lt;/a&gt; mobile GPUs, and the first one I’ve gotten to test. Given the price of the RTX 3070 model, it’s clear that’s the card Asus expects the 6800M to be trading blows with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4AOi1a"&gt;For some raw results: the Strix G15 averaged 252fps on &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, running the benchmark full of dust storms and fire blasts with no stutter in sight. The system averaged 87fps on &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, and 77fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2. &lt;/em&gt;It put up 69fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing on ultra, and 94fps with ray tracing off. (All games were run at native resolution at their highest possible settings). Basically, you should be able to run pretty much any game you want at playable frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F4KtaG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You should be able to run pretty much any game you want&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOZ26H"&gt;From the results here, it seems that the RX 6800M is performing slightly worse than (but comparably to) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;high-clocked RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; but is outperforming expectations for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;low-clocked RTX 3070&lt;/a&gt; on most titles. It’s an upgrade from last year’s Nvidia chips, beating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ 2020 ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 2070 Super on every game. We haven’t yet gotten to review the 3080 model of the Scar, but the frame rates &lt;a href="https://www.ultrabookreview.com/44764-asus-rog-scar-15-g533qs-review/"&gt;other reviews&lt;/a&gt; have reported are better than, but not worlds away from what I’m seeing here — and the Scar is almost &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GeForce-Opti-Mechanical-Keyboard-Windows-G533QS-XS98Q/dp/B08TZZRJT6?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 more&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also not too far off the what we’d expect from the &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Asus-ROG-Zephyrus-G15-laptop-review-Eye-catcher.517789.0.html"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; with a 100W RTX 3080 on some titles (and even better on some), so given that Asus has the 3080 Zephyrus listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/compare/202104AM020000002,"&gt;$1,999&lt;/a&gt; and the RTX 3070 model listed at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-15-6-qhd-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-1tb-ssd-eclipse-grey-eclipse-grey%2F6448848.p%3FskuId%3D6448848&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,849.99&lt;/a&gt; (though both models have a QHD screen instead of a 300Hz 1080p one and more storage) the Strix is a better deal going by performance alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjHaMn"&gt;Games also looked great on the 300Hz FHD display. Asus says there will be an option for a 165Hz QHD display as well; both have a 3ms response time. While I haven’t gotten to test that model yet, the panel on my configuration is less color accurate and dimmer than the QHD screen on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;, maxing out at 291 nits in my testing and covering 100 percent of the sRGB color gamut, 76 percent of the Adobe RGB gamut, and 78 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut. So if you prefer that colors pop or you plan on gaming outside, you’ll probably want the QHD display. My configuration is better for folks who want every last frame they can get — on a title like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll see more frames on the 300Hz screen than you would on the 165Hz one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the left side of the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jk-nASAMp4yAFMXGtcJHcGE-uAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552469/mchin_20190821_4609_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left: two USB-A, one audio jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ports on the back of the Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LPwPaGFpA9yKt80pQC6yJschaB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552470/mchin_20190821_4609_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the back: one power port, one Ethernet jack, one HDMI, one USB-C, one USB-A.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFegrz"&gt;Some of this performance can be attributed to Asus’ cooling, which did a decent job here. The Strix G15 has a vapor-chamber cooling system with new 84-blade “Arc Flow” fans that are supposed to increase airflow from previous Strix generations by 5 percent. The system works: it generally kept the CPU below 80 degrees Celsius with spikes up to the high 80s here and there. Temperatures on the keyboard and palm rests remained comfortable as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkDjiq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Temperatures on the keyboard and palm rests remained comfortable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsBnYp"&gt;There are a few different cooling profiles, and fans were quite audible on the Turbo profile during both gaming and productivity work. If you’re really feeling adventurous, you can set a manual profile with all power limits and fan speeds maxed out, and then you’ll hear fan noise like you’ve never heard before. (Admittedly, this didn’t do much to improve frame rates, but it was fun to try.) I never heard any fans on the Silent profile, even when I put my ear to the deck. The bottom of the chassis did get a bit toasty on my lap on Silent, though it was tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9Y0vn"&gt;The G15’s speakers are also plenty loud enough that you shouldn’t have a problem hearing your game’s audio over the fans. Bass and percussion were quite audible, which I rarely get to say about gaming laptop speakers. The Strix also comes preloaded with Dolby Access software, where you can swap between profiles for games, movies, music, and voice. The Music profile brings vocals to the forefront, but I actually preferred the Game and Movie profiles for my Spotify repertoire because they made the bass stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="foDlzM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10530844"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRInTK"&gt;The speakers and microphone support two-way AI noise cancellation. You can turn this feature on and off, and fiddle around with its intensity in Asus’ Armoury Crate software. The microphones had no trouble picking up my voice with and without the feature on, of course. That said, the Strix G15 wouldn’t be a great choice if you’ll be doing a lot of video calling because — as is often the case with many ROG products these days — it doesn’t have a webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j78z6e"&gt;But where the Strix G15 really makes its case is the battery gaming experience. I only got an hour of gaming out of one charge, which is a fairly short life span. However, the Strix ran &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;at playable rates for the entire time, maintaining between 30fps and 40fps for almost the entire hour, dropping to the high 20s around 12 percent, and remaining there until it died. I’d recommend this laptop to people who want to games on battery over others with more juice due to the large amount of actually playable time you get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Iqk4J2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life was very solid&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKJa3G"&gt;Battery life on the whole was very solid. I was averaging about two and a half hours on last year’s Strix Scar 15, and while I expected this AMD machine to last longer, I was shocked by how much more juice it had. Using the Strix G15 as my daily work driver on the Silent profile around 200 nits of brightness, I averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of continuous work and entertainment. That makes it one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops I’ve ever tested. It beats what I averaged on the Zephyrus G15 with the same workload — and I’ve been singing that device’s praises all year for its efficiency. It’s especially impressive because the Strix G15 is powering a ton of RGB LEDs (though it also has a lower-resolution screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQpB39"&gt;The 280W adapter also juices the Strix G15 decently fast; the device reached 60 percent in 38 minutes alongside light Chrome use. The brick is pretty hefty, but the Strix also supports 100W Type-C charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The red hinge cap on the back of the Asus ROG Strix G15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rjZTDCRP7b-eKNzNge0ev66e6yI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552471/mchin_20190821_4609_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can 3D print your own hinge caps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GwAQM4"&gt;Elsewhere, the chassis has the bold and flashy look that characterizes the Strix line. An RGB light bar runs under the front edge of the deck, and the keyboard has per-key RGB lighting. My unit came with a bright red plate on the left side of the otherwise black hinge, which you can swap out for faceplates of other colors if red isn’t your speed. It won’t be the aesthetic for everyone, but it’s certainly a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pm65qf"&gt;RGB aside, the chassis feels well made and quite sturdy. The lid is aluminum, and the palm rests have a smooth, comfortable texture with an unobtrusive pattern including the letters R, O, and G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jeX7K5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It won’t be the aesthetic for everyone, but it’s certainly a look&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QuklIe"&gt;Port selection is okay but could be better. There’s one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port (not Thunderbolt, since this is an AMD machine), an HDMI port (2.0b, rather than 2.1), three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports, an RJ45 LAN port, and a 3.5mm combination audio jack. The right side is port-less, but a number of ports are on the rear (including the power jack). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FvDcen"&gt;ROG keyboards are some of my favorite ones you can get, and this one is no exception — it’s comfortable with quite a bit of travel. There are useful dedicated keys for volume, cutting the mic, swapping between fan profiles, and pulling up Armoury Crate. The W, A, S, and D keys are a translucent white (in contrast to the rest of the caps, which are black) allowing you to see the switches beneath. I imagine this will be a controversial choice, though I personally like the look. The spacebar on my unit very occasionally squeaked, but that’s my only complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jqz6p4"&gt;The glass touchpad is smooth and roomy — it’s 85 percent larger than previous Strix touchpads, per Asus. I had no issues with palm rejection (which was a relief, considering that my right palm was often resting on the edge). It sometimes thought I was zooming when I meant to scroll, but I’ll take that over a jumpy cursor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix G15 closed, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-MFImj_bClitaOWhNkct_TSxqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552472/mchin_20190821_4609_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the chassis is 7 percent smaller than previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="ZojJxS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10530856"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="AMcvaU"&gt;All together, the Strix G15 Advantage Edition is an attractive package. There are nitpicks, sure. But at the price range Asus is providing, it’s hard to see any of them as dealbreakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGVaJ1"&gt;The question is whether you’re in the target demographic. For example, if you like the Strix’s flashy lights but want the absolute best performance you can get, you might be better suited paying more for the Strix Scar 15. If you’re looking for an RGB look that’s more subtle and refined, with a more practical port selection, you may find &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/alienware-m15-r4-gaming-laptop/spd/alienware-m15-r4-laptop" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alienware’s M15 R4&lt;/a&gt; more appealing. And if you want an excellent AMD system with all-day battery life, but don’t quite need this much power, you’ll be able to get all kinds of options, like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flegion-laptops%2Flegion-5-series%2FLenovo-Legion-5-15ARH05%2Fp%2F88GMY501444&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22465565%2Fasus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, at lower prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bvHC2P"&gt;But if you’re specifically looking for this kind of bold design, in an all-AMD system, at a sub-$2,000 price point, and are willing to give up a webcam and some modern ports, the Strix G15 Advantage Edition is probably the best you can do. Go much cheaper and you’re getting into territory where you’ll see significant compromises on performance. The Strix is more of a niche purchase than the lighter and subtler Zephyrus, but plenty of good laptops are. If it’s your thing, go for it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch console bundles are discounted at eBay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdXywK8DEfSAZJ9qcuimm6J-Utk=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69385470/EPkYDYeUcAEhol3.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BsAHuu"&gt;At eBay, the highly rated seller Antonline is listing two Switch bundles that are a little more affordable than it’d be to purchase each of the included items separately. Starting with the most appealing bundle (in terms of value and what’s included), the limited edition console with an &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;-inspired design comes with &lt;em&gt;New Pok&lt;/em&gt;é&lt;em&gt;mon Snap&lt;/em&gt; and a one-year family membership to Nintendo Switch Online, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F303987333681%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22466580%2Fnintendo-switch-console-bundle-ebay-animal-crossing-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;altogether costs $379&lt;/a&gt; (usually $395). Note that &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; isn’t included with this console. This bundle would make for an extremely good gift to yourself or someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVLKbu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10544531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="1BRC8A"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10545994"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to turn Zoom’s audio notifications on or off </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hpr_lAu65csqHoBVgC3BpgrMRRk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69384575/bfarsace_200407_3962_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sf8HI4"&gt;When somebody comes to your door — not a virtual door, your real door — and wants to get your attention, they usually ring the doorbell. Zoom has a feature that is sort of, kind of like that: it notifies you with a loud “ding dong” when somebody enters your meeting. This can be useful if you’re waiting for a friend to show up for a Zoom meeting and are playing with your dog or dusting the bookcase in the meantime. It can also be irritating if you’re part of a meeting with ten or more people, and you hear a “ding dong” every time somebody enters or leaves the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1mXmI"&gt;So if you want to turn this notification on — or off — here’s how you do it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="To turn audio notifications off, go to the web-based Settings page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UxEUL0dM5lybKXeSO24N6pUQLyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22556898/Screen_Shot_2021_06_02_at_4.46.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To turn audio notifications off, go to the web-based Settings page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2mdVdN"&gt;If you’re in the Zoom app, click on your personal icon (usually in the upper right corner). Select “Settings.” Go down to the bottom of the Settings page and click on “View More Settings.” This will open Zoom’s browser-based Settings page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tZTiiL"&gt;Alternatively, sign into Zoom using your browser rather than the app and click on “Settings” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OCbSo5"&gt;Click on “In Meeting (Basic)” in the left column and scroll down until you see “Sound notification when someone joins or leaves.” You can now toggle the feature on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WzUrzu"&gt;If the feature is toggled on, you will have the option of playing the sound for everyone who joins or leaves your meeting, or hosts and co-hosts only. You can also have Zoom ask to record the voice of someone who joins by phone to use as a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGKFbx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is getting updated visuals on PC alongside season 7 launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nK-kP7kvT-VdRM5iAuBW6S6c2T8=/360x0:3164x1869/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69384484/Fortnite_20210329165502.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUrL7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is getting a visual boost on PC very soon. As part of the upcoming Chapter 2: Season 7, which will launch on June 8th, the PC version of the game is getting a new “epic” graphical setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MquaUq"&gt;Epic says it will include “new and enhanced effects plus improved post-processing features and shadow quality.” Among other changes, it sounds like many of the great visual enhancements that came to the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game are coming to PC, including “more advanced explosion effects.” In other words, after you update, try to find a rocket launcher to play with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="od2sAL"&gt;As part of the update, the system requirements for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; are now getting a tweak. Basically, there are now three ranges: epic, recommended, and minimum. Here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tf0Q1V"&gt;Epic specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4QPD1X"&gt;Nvidia GTX 1080, AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT, or equivalent GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iWPGZ6"&gt;4GB VRAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BbYAuY"&gt;Intel Core i7-8700, AMD Ryzen 7 3700x, or equivalent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5z9l7T"&gt;16GB RAM or higher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0gJeoD"&gt;NVMe solid state drive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SYmZLo"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VuQqyu"&gt;Recommended specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MShfLo"&gt;Nvidia GTX 960, AMD R9 280, or equivalent DX11 GPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YKGSLk"&gt;2GB VRAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ea82aU"&gt;Core i5-7300U 3.5GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1QDqM"&gt;8GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ouJFCX"&gt;Windows 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kMzWdq"&gt;Minimum specs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="07pyiz"&gt;Intel HD 4000 on PC; Intel Iris Pro 5200&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AJVNwC"&gt;Core i3-3225 3.3GHz&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="43QDA4"&gt;4GB RAM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4nnLUk"&gt;Windows 7 / 8 / 10 64-bit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EsBnxf"&gt;Season 7 kicks off on June 8th — and it looks like it’ll add &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465577/fortnite-epic-games-ufos-aliens-abducted-teaser-season-7"&gt;an extraterrestrial element&lt;/a&gt; to the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Twitter Blue subscription service starts rolling out Thursday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDVAkQZ_5CYffgKx7MUUZzOutSg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69383695/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ECmy4P"&gt;Twitter has officially announced Twitter Blue, a paid subscription service that offers access to new features like undoing tweets and viewing threads in an easier to digest “Reader Mode.” Starting Thursday, it will roll out first in Canada and Australia, where the subscription will cost $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD per month, respectively. We already had a good idea of what features to expect from Twitter Blue thanks to sleuthing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;from app researcher Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, but now Twitter has detailed everything the service includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2eINro"&gt;A new undo send feature gives you the option of retracting your tweets before they actually go live, and you can set a timer for undoing your tweets that can last up to 30 seconds. A Bookmark Folders feature lets you group saved tweets to make them easier to find later. “Reader Mode” lets you keep up with threads by “turning them into easy-to-read text” and mashing together tweets into one page. Other Twitter Blue features are purely aesthetic: it adds new color theme options as well as the ability to change the color of Twitter’s app icon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIFPnK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10529553"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0DJsli"&gt;Twitter Blue subscribers will also get access to “dedicated subscription customer support,” the company says. This means that Twitter Blue users will get an expedited timeframe for resolving issues, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The expedited timeframe applies to any type of &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/forms"&gt;support ticket&lt;/a&gt; that you might file, which means you’ll get faster support both for account-related problems as well as if you’re reporting someone for harassment. Abuse and harassment continue to be an issue for Twitter, and paid prioritization for support could cause some controversy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQK4It"&gt;Twitter says it’s launching Twitter Blue first in Australia and Canada “to gain a deeper understanding of what will make your Twitter experience more customized, more expressive, and generally speaking more [fire emoji].” The company didn’t have a timeline to share for when Twitter Blue might expand to other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc1ECQ"&gt;Offering a paid subscription service is a significant change to Twitter’s business model that the company has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15043422/twitter-subscription-service-tweetdeck-survey"&gt;considering for some time&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the company has relied mainly on advertising for its revenue, but intense competition from Facebook and Snapchat’s ad businesses, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;pressure from activist investors&lt;/a&gt; has pushed it to explore new sources of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPKaQU"&gt;In early May, Twitter began testing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;Tip Jar service&lt;/a&gt; that lets users send one-off payments to their favorite accounts. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows feature&lt;/a&gt;, announced in February, will eventually let users charge subscriptions for things like bonus tweets, community groups, or newsletters. (Newsletters were made possible after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250156/twitter-revue-newsletter-acquisition-email-service"&gt;Twitter acquired newsletter service Revue&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the year.) Twitter has not yet announced when its Super Follows feature will launch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti is available online right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6hRb8txFV_KSYCjKWXIt3tanBI=/13x0:2040x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69382152/twarren_20210601_4611_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAmB8N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;Nvidia TX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt; is here, at least for those lucky enough to find one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22461660/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;Announced earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; alongside the forthcoming RTX 3070 Ti, the 3080 Ti serves as the pricier successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;GeForce RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, an excellent graphics card that made 4K gaming that much more affordable and exemplified just how transformative DLSS technology could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbE3b0"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21417048/nvidia-rtx-3090-gpu-flagship-8k-pc-gaming-price-specs"&gt;RTX 3090&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s newest flagship touts impressive 1440p and 4K performance, albeit in a smaller, quieter package with half the VRAM. It certainly isn’t cheap at $1,200, but given the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;semiconductor shortage&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;outlandish street prices&lt;/a&gt; of most GPUs right now, the RTX 3080 Ti might be more affordable at MSRP than if you were to succumb to the resale market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAXA33"&gt;While we expect availability to be limited at launch and throughout the remainder of the year, several retailers currently have the RTX 3080 Ti in stock. Best Buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465116/best-buy-stores-nvidia-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-thursday-line-up"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it would give customers a chance to purchase a Founder’s Edition of the card at &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/what-to-know-about-nvidias-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-founders-edition-graphics-card/"&gt;select stores&lt;/a&gt; today, however, unlike previous years, Best Buy will only offer the GPU in-store. Customers who are hoping to pick it up at launch will need to line up early and secure a ticket at 7:30AM local time before it officially goes on sale at 9:00AM local time. If you’re reading this now, chances are good that you’re already too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FrcW3u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nvidia is nerfing new RTX 3080 and 3070 cards for Ethereum cryptocurrency mining ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ctbNK4"&gt;Heading to your local Micro Center might be your only other viable option, if you’re hoping to get one in-store. That retailer &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=GeForce+RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;lists five RTX 3080 Ti models on its site&lt;/a&gt; from Gigabyte, Asus, EVGA, and MSI. If you’re looking to purchase the RTX 3080 Ti online, your options are limited. The cards will go on sale at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3FNtt%3Drtx%25203080%2520ti%26N%3D0%26InitialSearch%3Dyes%26sts%3Dma&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F3%2F22465644%2Fnvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-stock-gpu-availability-where-to-buy-graphics-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fnvidia%2F21-1195%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=GeForce+RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;Micro Center&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=RTX+3080+Ti"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, however, we expect stock to sell out fast.

    <title>Amazon Halo will use your smartphone camera to assess your ‘Movement Health’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon’s new Movement Health feature in Halo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ir_NOvHL-9Jwwrw7p2I8aO7Mezk=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69382068/amazon_halo_movement.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon’s new Movement Health feature in Halo | Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fLivFM"&gt;Soon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon’s Halo fitness service&lt;/a&gt; will offer to use your smartphone’s camera and some cloud-based AI to create a scan of your “Movement Health.” After a five- to 10-minute session where you put yourself into different poses for the camera, Amazon’s servers will analyze the video and use it to create a customized workout routine to improve your “stability, mobility, and posture.” The service is expected to launch “in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj9o0W"&gt;As with Halo’s body fat scan, Amazon says that the video it records for Movement Health is sent to its cloud servers, analyzed &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; by its algorithms (and not humans), and is then promptly deleted both from the cloud and from your phone. The videos are encrypted in transit and when they’re (briefly) at rest in Amazon’s cloud. The Halo fitness band isn’t used in any particular way during the scan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="faynR6"&gt;After the scan, you’ll get a readout like the image you see above, which breaks down the mobility of your body in terms of percentages — presumably percentages of the ideal range of movement. Njenga Kariuki, senior technical product manager for Amazon Halo, says that its machine learning algorithms were created with a diverse set of bodies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UJObyb"&gt;We take a responsibility to ensure that our algorithms deliver comparable performance across demographics and body types and we extensively test different dimensions across things like body types, different ethnicity groups, a number of different demographic dimensions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DG4F2Z"&gt;However, the result of that training is an algorithm that applies the same assessments to all users, regardless of body type or level of mobility. “The limitations we look at during the assessment are consistent across all customers,” Kariuki says. Kariuki also claims that the new tool “delivers comparable accuracy to an in-person assessment with a professional trainer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f278Gj"&gt;Amazon uses those percentages to create a “personalized program of corrective exercise videos” that are designed to improve your mobility. The company says that Halo will offer each user about five to 10 videos that will range from simple stretches to full workouts specific to their needs. So while it’s nowhere near as ambitious as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299628/apple-fitness-plus-review-price-classes-features"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; (or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Samsung’s Smart Trainer&lt;/a&gt; feature), it’s not designed to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve3u7m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo launched last August&lt;/a&gt; as a combination of a $99.99 fitness band and a $3.99 / month health subscription service. It was (and is) an obvious example of Amazon’s willingness to push the envelope of what kinds of metrics people might want from their quantified self gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoeGLY"&gt;It offers a body fat scan that works very much like the Movement Health scan. The Halo Band can do all the typical health tracking things you’d expect from a fitness tracker (like sleep and activity), but you also have the option to leave the microphone on so it can give you its take on your tone of voice throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9L9IZ"&gt;Movement Health doesn’t feel quite as invasive as those assessments, but whether it’s a useful enough feature to drive users to Amazon Halo remains to be seen. Apple Fitness Plus recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385653/apple-fitness-plus-new-workouts-pregnant-beginner-older-users-jane-fonda"&gt;began offering videos specifically designed&lt;/a&gt; for beginners as well as “workouts tailored for both pregnant and elderly users.” Amazon’s new offering for Halo might be a part of a larger trend of providing more approachable fitness content for people who don’t aspire to have a daily workout routine. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is making it harder for Android apps to track you once you’ve opted out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FGvCjo6Itb8btU3DYwal_Bax5aQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69382015/acastro_180507_1777_android_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xtVuAo"&gt;It’s going to get harder for Android apps to track users who’ve opted out of receiving personalized ads, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ff67e5a6-ca3e-42d2-98b8-01e656a6d396?sharetype=blocked"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, after Google announced changes to how it’ll handle the unique device identifiers that allow marketers to track them between apps. Starting later this year, Google is cutting off access to these “Advertising IDs” after a user opts out, and will show developers a “string of zeros” in its place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xrhpy4"&gt;The news was announced in an email to Play Store developers, and Google has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248"&gt;support page for Advertising IDs&lt;/a&gt; with the announcement. Google told developers the changes will “provide users with more control over their data, and help bolster security and privacy,” the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFwE6I"&gt;The change comes a few short months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple overhauled how advertising IDs work&lt;/a&gt; on iOS in an apparent attempt to compete with the new policy. Recently, Google also announced that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422894/google-play-app-privacy-info-apple-app-store-labels"&gt;adding privacy info to its Play Store listings&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring a similar feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;Apple added to its App Store&lt;/a&gt; last year, and is also limiting which apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364632/google-play-store-apps-see-other-installed-may-5-query-all-packages"&gt;can see what you have installed&lt;/a&gt; on your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="plpq1Q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The changes will start rolling out later this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZmATO"&gt;Users have long been able to opt out of personalized ads on Android (you can do so by heading into the Settings app, going into the Google menu, and selecting “Ads”), but it seems this doesn’t currently stop developers from being able to access your device’s advertising ID entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/mobile/google-tightens-limit-ad-tracking-policies-for-android-ad-id/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AdExchanger &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that apps have previously been able to use the identifier for non-advertising purposes like analytics and fraud prevention, and Google’s support page says it will announce an “alternate solution” for these use cases next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUVXol"&gt;Google’s support page says that the rollout of the new policy will happen in phases. Android 12 devices will start seeing the change in “late 2021,” before it rolls out to all devices with Google Play early next year. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-play-services-delete-ad-id-opt-out-personalization/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google Play Services will also notify existing apps with access to your advertising ID and related data, so that this can be deleted where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzhOlh"&gt;Although Google’s announcement follows hot on the heels of Apple’s own ad tracking changes, it’s not yet clear how similar the two approaches will be. Google’s support page still refers to the decision to stop ad tracking as an “opt out” process, while Apple’s changes effectively make tracking an opt-in decision. But regardless of how Google eventually handles the process, it’s another potentially huge shake-up for the digital advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Netflix’s Geeked Week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5GgkC-Vd3dPmTAPx1IYQhDPOec=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381785/LUCIFER_403_Unit_00191R.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRZwVA"&gt;Netflix is holding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448313/netflix-geeked-week-event-the-witcher-sandman-cuphead-resident-evil"&gt;its first “Geeked” virtual event&lt;/a&gt; starting on June 7th, an entire week dedicated to genre stories across film and TV. That means sci-fi and fantasy, and shows based on comic books and video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZabuE"&gt;The company says that more than 50 projects will be featured, including big names like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sandman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lucifer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417254/league-of-legends-animated-series-arcane-netflix"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; animated series&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;, and more. In addition to big announcements and trailers, the event will also include “first looks, behind-the-scenes footage, cast interviews, celebrity games, script table reads, live performances, and much more,” according to Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9YMT7"&gt;It’s a lot to spread across five days. Here’s how you can keep up with everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z6PNMH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UTi1pLgi1vY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5RV0um"&gt;What time is Netflix’s Geeked Week?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Su4im6"&gt;The event takes place from June 7th to the 11th, and Netflix says that things will kick off at  9AM PT / 12PM ET. The company will also be posting daily recaps at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, suggesting that things will last around an hour each day. There isn’t an exact schedule, but Netflix says that “each day will be broadly themed to different genres: film, comic books, fantasy, anime / animation, and gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pJMbUQ"&gt;Where can I watch the event?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lLn9Wa"&gt;If you want to watch everything, it seems like it’ll be hard to miss, as Netflix will be utilizing just about every video platform imaginable. That means you can watch and follow the daily events on &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/netflix"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitch.tv/netflix"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://facebook.com/netflixgeeked"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://tiktok.com/@netflixgeeked"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;. And be sure to stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for coverage of the biggest announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft looks ready to launch Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JgA2sVO8AEXsyUZESl5LYCXnWzA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69381801/RWF5uB.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wSNjTr"&gt;Microsoft has been teasing a “next generation” of Windows for months now, but new hints suggest the company isn’t just preparing an update to its existing Windows 10 software, but a new, numbered version of the operating system: Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNZDDn"&gt;The software giant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465126/microsoft-windows-event-june-24th"&gt;announced a new Windows event for June 24th&lt;/a&gt; yesterday, promising to show “what’s next for Windows.” The event invite included an image of what looks like a new Windows logo, with light shining through the window in only two vertical bars, creating an outline that looks very much like the number 11. Microsoft followed up with an animated version of this image, making it clear the company intentionally ignored the horizontal bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23AbkU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Join us June 24th at 11 am ET for the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftEvent&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s next. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi"&gt;https://t.co/kSQYIDZSyi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Emb5GPHOf0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Emb5GPHOf0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Windows (@Windows) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1400125115765907458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IimQvJ"&gt;Microsoft’s Windows event also starts at 11AM ET, not the usual start time for typical Windows and Surface events. Following the event invite, Microsoft exec &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/yusuf_i_mehdi/status/1400125771746746371"&gt;Yusuf Mehdi said&lt;/a&gt; he hasn’t “been this excited for a new version of Windows since Windows 95!” It’s the first time we’ve heard Microsoft specifically mention a “new version” of Windows is on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83VbqA"&gt;The event invite also comes just a week after Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453222/microsoft-windows-next-generation-announcement-sun-valley-build-2021-keynote"&gt;teased a “next generation of Windows” announcement&lt;/a&gt;. Nadella promised that Microsoft would soon share “one of the most significant updates to Windows of the past decade.” Microsoft’s chief product officer, Panos Panay, also teased a “next generation” of Windows earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au4LOt"&gt;If Microsoft is truly readying to move beyond Windows 10 and towards Windows 11, we’re expecting to see big visual changes to reflect that. Microsoft has been working on something codenamed Sun Valley, which the company has referred to as a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_SH6v9iEEDYwVrtRSrlYFtbWGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495503/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big UI changes are coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sAm7wK"&gt;A lot of these visual changes will come from the work Microsoft completed on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight version of Windows intended to rival Chrome OS, before it was scrapped. That includes a new Start menu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt; that drag Windows users back to the past in dialog boxes. Rounded corners and updates to the built-in Windows apps are also planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8Us7C"&gt;Significant changes are also on the way for Windows beyond the user interface. Microsoft appears to be ready to address a lot of lingering problems, with fixes planned for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, an upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and improvements to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hku6Eq"&gt;Perhaps the biggest lingering issue waiting to be fixed is the Windows store. Microsoft has been working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393655/microsoft-windows-app-store-overhaul-apps-games-rumor"&gt;new app store for Windows&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and rumors suggest it will be a significant departure from what exists today. Nadella has promised to “unlock greater economic opportunity for developers and creators” with Windows, and the Windows store seems like the obvious way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gFgXen"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly overhauling its Windows app store to allow developers to submit any Windows application, including browsers like Chrome or Firefox. This would significantly improve the store alone, but Microsoft might also be considering allowing third-party commerce platforms in apps. That would mean Microsoft wouldn’t take a cut from developers who use their own in-app purchase systems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y11yGrzfA0LcAlNJ7zr-_Fh2pNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235025/10xactioncenter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the changes Microsoft planned for Windows 10X are now coming to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StQAMK"&gt;So far, Microsoft has only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;announced a cut to 12 percent&lt;/a&gt; commission for PC games in the Windows store, but allowing developers to bypass Microsoft’s cut would be a significant change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS37fV"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 branding would also back up Microsoft’s reinvestment in Windows. The software maker signaled a renewed interest in Windows last year, during a pandemic that has demonstrated how important the operating system is. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Windows usage jumped&lt;/a&gt; as workers and students across the world turned to laptops and PCs to work from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319750/pc-shipments-coronavirus-pandemic-idc-gartner-q2-2020"&gt;PC shipments have also surged&lt;/a&gt; over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPLbSQ"&gt;After slicing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17176220/microsoft-windows-reorg-business-terry-myerson-ai-cloud"&gt;Windows into two parts&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018, Microsoft moved parts of Windows development back under Panos Panay’s control last year. The move was a clear admission that Microsoft’s Windows split didn’t work, after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645609/microsofts-universal-windows-app-dead-microsoft-store-windows-store"&gt;messy development experiences&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21276653/microsoft-windows-10-may-2020-update-block-known-issues-list"&gt;delayed Windows updates&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20678596/windows-10-19h2-update-september-feature-update"&gt;lack of major new features&lt;/a&gt;, and lots of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951298/microsoft-windows-10-bugs-issues-report"&gt;Windows update issues&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1c0xE"&gt;Moving to Windows 11 would still be a surprise move for Microsoft, though. The company previously referred to Windows 10 as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/7/8568473/windows-10-last-version-of-windows"&gt;the last version of Windows&lt;/a&gt;” in its big push to position the OS as a service that’s continually updated. While there are monthly updates to Windows, the more significant changes are typically delivered twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new version of Windows always helps boost PC sales.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ta7qIh"&gt;Microsoft has struggled with naming these updates, though. We’ve seen the Windows 10 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/25/12269736/microsoft-windows-10-anniversary-update-features-review"&gt;Anniversary Update&lt;/a&gt;, Fall &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16487760/microsoft-windows-10-fall-creators-update-features-review"&gt;Creators Update&lt;/a&gt;, and simple dates like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20885221/microsoft-windows-10-october-update-release-date-download-features-how-to"&gt;November 2019 Update&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has also adopted yet another naming scheme recently, referring to updates as 20H1 or 21H1 to signify both the release year and part of the year the update launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4pLi7"&gt;A move to Windows 11 wouldn’t necessarily clear up Microsoft’s update naming issues, but if the company also adopted point releases like Windows 11.1, that would certainly help both consumers and IT admins to quickly understand which version is the latest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMGD6s"&gt;OEMs would also be happy to see a Windows 11 release. A new version of Windows always drives new hardware sales and renewed interest in the operating system. If Microsoft backs that up with a new UI and a fresh look and feel for Windows, it will be the typical playbook we’ve seen for Windows for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I42Eoc"&gt;It’s not long until we find out whether Microsoft is ready to dial the version number of Windows up to 11. The Windows elevent (as I’m now calling it) will start at 11AM ET on June 24th, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering all the news live as it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
