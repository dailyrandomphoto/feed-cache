    <title>Twitter planning a feature to let you auto-block and mute abusive accounts</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yMhBh6q_mT1LeR1BX2CSpVlLSMc=/0x83:1898x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68875042/twitter_auto_block.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dgZp9v"&gt;Twitter plans to introduce a way for you to automatically block and mute abusive accounts, the company announced at its Analyst Day presentation on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6TFyA"&gt;It appears the feature will be a toggle you can turn on in a new “safety mode,” according to a slide in the &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_presentations/Analyst_Day_2021/3_AnalystDay2021_Kayvon-Dantley.pdf"&gt;Analyst Day slide deck&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s Twitter’s description of how the toggle will work if you flip it on: “Automatically block accounts that appear to break the Twitter Rules, and mute accounts that might be using insults, name-calling, strong language, or hateful remarks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi2JPu"&gt;With the new safety mode, Twitter will automatically detect accounts that “might be acting abusive or spammy” and limit how those accounts can engage with your content for seven days, according to the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KsNNmW"&gt;We’ve asked Twitter for more information about the new features and will update this article with anything we hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3xAsg"&gt;Twitter has historically struggled with abuse on its platform and has released a number of features over the years to help reduce offensive content, such as letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20874847/twitter-feature-launch-us-japan-rollout-hide-replies"&gt;hide replies&lt;/a&gt; and letting users control &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362514/twitter-reply-limiting-features-all-users-harassment-rollout-available-now"&gt;who can reply to an individual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. The company also has some automated tools in place to remove abusive tweets, and it said in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929290/twitter-abusive-tweets-automated-removal-earnings-q3-2019"&gt;that it removes&lt;/a&gt; more than 50 percent of abusive tweets before users report them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter announces paid Super Follows to let you charge for tweets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsLOAzuzeofpXnNtsKmWeJqECQY=/0x92:1842x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874995/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_1.11.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter’s mockup of its Super Follows feature. | Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7DOSFJ"&gt;Twitter announced a pair of big upcoming features today: the ability for users to charge their followers for access to additional content, and the ability to create and join groups based around specific interests. They’re two of the more substantial changes to Twitter in a while, but they also fit snugly into models that have been popular and successful on other social platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQj3iG"&gt;The payment feature, called Super Follows, will allow Twitter users to charge followers and give them access to extra content. That could be bonus tweets, access to a community group, subscription to a newsletter, or a badge indicating your support. In a mockup screenshot, Twitter showed an example where a user charges $4.99 per month to receive a series of perks. Twitter sees it as a way to let creators and publishers get paid directly by their fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AZ2aha"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Communities could be Twitter’s take on Facebook Groups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0ffzf8"&gt;Direct payment tools have become increasingly important for creators in particular in recent years. Patreon has been hugely successful, and other platforms including Facebook, YouTube, and even GitHub have all launched direct creator payment features. Twitter will presumably take a cut — the company has been hinting at subscriptions features that would offer it a new source of revenue — though it doesn’t appear to have said yet what that fee will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrxiJo9sR0o8dc_YDuazMlZhZ90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328742/twitter_communities.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter’s mockup of its Communities feature.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ccH4m7"&gt;Twitter also announced a new feature called Communities, which appear to be its take on something like Facebook Groups. People can create and join groups around specific interests — like cats or plants, Twitter suggests — allowing them to see more tweets focused on those topics. Groups have been a huge success for Facebook (and a huge moderation problem, too), and they could be a particularly helpful tool on Twitter, since the service’s open-ended nature can make it difficult for new users to get started on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXBJ5l"&gt;There’s no timeline yet for when either of these features will launch. Twitter listed them as “what’s next” for its platform during a presentation for analysts and investors this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to buy Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_xC0e_-R_mHspcZBFq1U1sCY88=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873032/shollister_200224_4441_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;EVGA’s RTX 3060 graphics card | Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re sacrificing more than a little bit of performance compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21768294/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-when-where-how-to-buy-gpu"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LG09Kn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10360060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aSEuLX"&gt;So far, Best Buy, Micro Center, and Newegg (&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fproduct-shuffle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg Shuffle&lt;/a&gt;) are the only retailers that have put listings up for the RTX 3060. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

If you are looking to buy the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Walmart plans to restock the console at 12PM PT / 3PM ET today. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301306/xbox-series-x-walmart-restock-time-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtyNLT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 09:07AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop has run out of stock, but Target now has supply available for both the Xbox Series X and Series S. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SQNYsH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-console%2F-%2FA-80790842&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles have been available to purchase since last fall, but actually finding one to buy has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking to buy either console, Target has both models in stock, and they are available for preorder while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Regardless of which console you buy, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P06Nfx"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpa4v9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOq3lx"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 25th, 2021 12:36PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart plans to restock both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; today. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22065347"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months. Available at the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-all-access%23findaretailer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fxbox-one%2Fxbox-all-access%2Fpcmcat1579299055180.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1579299055180&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fxbox-all-access%2F8571041&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-all-access%2F-%2FN-he40f&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this piece about why you may be seeing a lot of city pop in your feeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEBc92t4S2C8ZiRp2o3EiOe9Vvg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874655/acastro_181016_1777_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FnDtch"&gt;City pop is a genre defined by nostalgia. Though, as Cat Zhang writes, that nostalgia is algorithmically generated — and its recent popularity is wrapped in the acceleration of global exchange and a whole Western mythology of Japan as the capitalist future. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/article/the-endless-life-cycle-of-japanese-city-pop/"&gt;Zhang published an elegant capsule history of the genre in &lt;em&gt;Pitchfork&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also explains why the music is surging in popularity in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyZ6Dk"&gt;Naturally, it started in Japan. “The upswing of city pop likely originates with the &lt;a href="https://www.electronicbeats.net/city-pop-guide-japans-overlooked-80s-disco-10-tracks/"&gt;Japanese themselves&lt;/a&gt;: a few decades ago, domestic crate diggers started critically reevaluating vintage Japanese music, or &lt;a href="https://wamono.bandcamp.com/"&gt;wamono&lt;/a&gt;,” Zhang writes. Then, some decades later, it hit Western ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyaVSZ"&gt;“Japanese music isn’t particularly accessible overseas: The country has been exceptionally &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-music/change-of-tune-japan-music-fans-moving-from-cds-to-streaming-services-idUSKBN27Q0GB"&gt;slow to embrace&lt;/a&gt; streaming, prioritizing the consumption of CDs, and its expansion into foreign music markets has also been sluggish,” Zhang writes. “One recent breakthrough was the compilation &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pacific-breeze-japanese-city-pop-aor-and-boogie-1976-1986/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR &amp;amp; Boogie 1976–1986&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; released in 2019 by the reissue label Light in the Attic as part of their &lt;a href="https://www.discogs.com/label/1357715-Japan-Archival-Series"&gt;Japan archival series&lt;/a&gt;. The project, which now &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-pacific-breeze-2-japanese-city-pop-aor-and-boogie-1972-1986/"&gt;has a sequel&lt;/a&gt;, took four years to bring to fruition.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blysxH"&gt;The other part of city pop’s sudden American popularity has to do with the recommendation algorithms that drive our social platforms. City pop thrives on YouTube because its algorithm can’t recognize nuance. “[T]he algorithm will simply route listeners from “lo-fi beats” videos to “Plastic Love,’” Zhang writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgYErw"&gt;The whole piece is fascinating. As the writer Kyle Chayka wrote &lt;a href="https://dirt.substack.com/p/dirt-80s-japan-footage-city-pop-nostalgia"&gt;today in his newsletter DIRT&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="4fxsqO"&gt;[N]one of these artifacts are completely authentic, and none the result of a single gaze, self or other. The stitched-together footage and the remixed, re-uploaded music are the kind of fictions that culture is always producing, the present digesting the past in order to produce something hybrid and new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="WRDMnb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the Xbox Series X available at 3PM ET today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QLzBUiSLAKlaLPRBADR3OBnbYo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874647/vpavic_4275_20201030_0033.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njkeDE"&gt;If you missed Target’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;early morning&lt;/a&gt; Xbox Series X restocks today, you have another chance today to secure Microsoft’s next-gen console. A Walmart spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the retailer will have the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; available for purchase today, February 25th, at 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfM933"&gt;Walmart told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; you will have two options to pay for the console — with a one-time payment of $499.99 or pay with Xbox All Access, which requires a monthly payment for 24 months. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20935894/microsoft-xbox-all-access-bundle-offer-project-scarlett-upgrade-deal"&gt;Xbox All Access is a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that splits the cost of an Xbox console; Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes both versions of the video game streaming service; access to xCloud; and Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AfBWYF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ASjwVc"&gt;If you are buying either an Xbox Series X or S, there are a few additional items outside of video games you may want to consider purchasing, such as an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF248LD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;additional controller&lt;/a&gt;. And unlike the PS5, you can purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB SSD expansion&lt;/a&gt; to add to the Xbox’s base storage (512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X), though it is not cheap. Alternatively, you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive to store your games&lt;/a&gt;, but any games stored through it will not take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zhFeF"&gt;If you are having trouble deciding on what games to buy, you can always buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of digital games and access to Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fYVrti"&gt;The Virtual Desktop app for the Oculus Quest has been updated to enable the wireless streaming of PC VR games natively over Wi-Fi, eliminating the need to go through the complex multistep sideloading process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;I outlined here&lt;/a&gt;. Oddly enough, this isn’t the first time the app has sported this feature. Its developer introduced it in the app in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;but claims it was forced to remove it&lt;/a&gt; because Oculus was developing its own wireless streaming solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYU8iG"&gt;According to an interview with &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/pc-streaming-quest-virtual-desktop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Guy Godin, the app’s developer, submitted the feature recently to Oculus’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262794/oculus-update-app-lab-vr-early-access-sideloading"&gt;App Lab&lt;/a&gt;, which is a newly launched fork of the Oculus Store for early access games and experiences. But interestingly, Oculus approved the feature for the app in the main store instead, and you can grab the update right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRltuT"&gt;Godin shared to &lt;em&gt;UploadVR &lt;/em&gt;that more than 90 percent of Virtual Desktop users have gone  through the complicated setup process to enable wireless streaming. But with this new update, it’ll be far easier for new users to stream titles they own on PC like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boneworks&lt;/em&gt;, and more without a significant amount of hassle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxEER5"&gt;You can pick up the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2017050365004772%2F%3Flocale%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F25%2F22301151%2Foculus-store-virtual-desktop-native-pc-vr-game-streaming-quest-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Virtual Desktop app made for Quest &lt;/a&gt;for $19.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify will let you filter your liked songs by mood and genre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoGcvbJk3ByvYAtwpB7e1bMO8KQ=/0x0:1734x1156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874385/spotifyfilters.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmwhRb"&gt;Spotify’s making it easier to parse your liked songs. The company is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-25/how-to-sort-your-favorite-songs-with-spotifys-new-genre-and-mood-filters/"&gt;rolling out a new feature today&lt;/a&gt; that’ll let users filter their liked songs by genre and mood. This way, you can enjoy more of what you like without compromising on the vibe. I, for example, have songs that would be fun in the club but also folky songs for relaxation time, both of which are under my liked songs umbrella. This new feature would let me decide what mood I’m in and then listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RElnO"&gt;To access the filters, you have to have at least 30 liked songs. You can then go to your library, tap into liked songs, and select a filter that’s listed across the top. You can remove that filter whenever you like and swap in a new one. These filters will change as you like new songs, Spotify says. For now, they will only be rolling out to English-speaking markets, including the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1TB0I"&gt;Spotify has made it no secret that it wants to be the app for every kind of audio need, including music and podcasts. Although this feature is small, it’s the kind of update that makes a product more useful for everyday use and could keep people coming back to the app to like songs, which is what Spotify wants. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mailchimp employees have complained about inequality for years — is anyone listening? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzz4scLmEoy58W5HuTrzCeJoFEo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874375/VRG_ILLO_4446_002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Behind the claims of sexism and racism at Atlanta’s premier tech startup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TB4pqv"&gt;Alejandra Luaces had only worked at Mailchimp for four months when she got a surprising anonymous email. “Oliver* is in an open marriage and is fair game,” the message read, referring to a senior engineering manager. “Serena* also knows so you can ask her to confirm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPwMB4"&gt;Luaces was not interested in Oliver. She certainly wasn’t interested in asking a female employee about his marriage. As a product operations manager — and one of the few Latinx women in the engineering org — Luaces was determined to succeed at one of the most prestigious tech companies in Atlanta, according to sources close to the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTB4R7"&gt;The events were confirmed by three former employees as well as internal documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oYBSA"&gt;In June 2016, one month after the anonymous email, Luaces and Oliver went to a diversity conference together in New York City. Luaces’ department was going through a reorg, and she was interested in a position on his team. Oliver seemed open to it, even suggesting that he’d speak to the engineering director on her behalf. But he also became increasingly flirtatious, allegedly sending Luaces late-night texts hinting that he wanted to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nxwKav"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq1pHn"&gt;After they returned to Atlanta, Oliver sent her a message saying he’d thought they were going to hook up on the trip. Luaces responded that she didn’t think it was a good idea. Shortly after, the offer to move to his team seemingly evaporated. Luaces’ role was being eliminated in the reorg, and she was told she could either take a lower-level position or leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePdFvC"&gt;In the offer letter for the new role, Mailchimp managers told Luaces that she would not be eligible for a pay raise for “at least the next year, and maybe a few years.” The letter also said that while Luaces was a hard worker, “the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s been noted that you’re a hard worker when you have ample tasks assigned to you, but the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full. You will need to manage your own workload (with the help of your team lead and manager) and also put a real effort into being seen as a contributor who works hard at their job." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHfvc4_kNbrrjuxyxitoVLW0D54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328067/offer_letter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offer letter Mailchimp sent to Alejandra Luaces for an internal transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLWkjj"&gt;Luaces’ experience at Mailchimp is now roughly three years old. If her complaint was an isolated incident, there probably wouldn’t be a story. But according to 11 current and former employees, Mailchimp has continued to struggle with instances of sexism, bias, and perceived pay disparities since Luaces left in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPFtAe"&gt;Employees say the company’s position as one of the premier startups in Atlanta allows it to view workers as disposable, as there are fewer tech jobs to choose from than if the company were located in San Francisco or New York City. They also say that because the organization is private and has never taken on outside investment, executives can operate without the specter of more public accountability. Many feel they’ve exhausted every option internally and are only speaking to the press as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut6MFk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “We’ve always wanted Mailchimp to be a place where everyone feels included, respected, and empowered to do their best work. But that hasn’t been the experience for all of our employees. Over the past four years we’ve doubled in size, and while we worked hard to foster an inclusive culture as we grew, we fell short in some important areas.” The company declined to comment on&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;questions about individual personnel matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKKPtR"&gt;Stories about Mailchimp’s company culture began circulating on February 17th, 2021, after a principal engineer, Kelly Ellis, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280"&gt;posted a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about her decision to leave. She said she’d dealt with “sexism and bullying” and was underpaid compared to male colleagues. (Ellis did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zMDnUH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welp, I guess it's official: I'm leaving my job. I dealt with sexism and bullying, and found out that I, as the only female principal eng, was paid less than the other (male) principals outside of Atlanta. I would not recommend friends work at Mailchimp, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;— Kelly Ellis (@justkelly_ok) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtDIB6"&gt;Mailchimp told employees that it had investigated Ellis’ claims and found them to be unsubstantiated. But CEO Ben Chestnut also said that he knew the company needed to do better. “I’m hearing loud and clear that we have work to do, including needing greater transparency around pay equity and an intentional focus on inclusion,” he wrote in a letter to staffers, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-ceo-ben-chestnut-email-pay-equity-discrimination-kelly-ellis-2021-2"&gt;which was first reported in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I want to address these issues head-on, and I know we’ll be stronger for it. I’m asking our leadership team to prioritize these issues and work with me to fix them. What we do needs to match what we say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWakR"&gt;Group chats and Slack groups filled with former Mailchimp employees were set ablaze by the news. Workers began discussing their own experiences with alleged discrimination and unequal pay, wondering whether what they viewed as the open secret of Mailchimp’s company culture would finally be brought into the open. “They’re going to have to acknowledge the problems that are being raised, and respond with something other than, ‘we have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong,’” one said in an alumni Slack. “I wish more people would speak out but I wont for the same reasons (NDA, fear of retaliation),” another responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJlERx"&gt;Mariesa Dale, a design manager who joined the company in 2018, left after a year due to what she says was a misogynistic culture. “The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbsP5q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ued2"&gt;Dale remembers that once, a manager shushed her when she responded to a question she’d been asked directly during a meeting with him and another male colleague. He then asked her male counterpart to answer the question. She says that when she went to HR to tell them about the behavior, nothing seemed to change. “Leadership at Mailchimp clearly knows about this and doesn’t do anything about it,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eutYgx"&gt;In response to this allegation, Mailchimp said no formal HR complaints have been filed against the manager in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4nnde"&gt;A female leader who left the company in 2019 said she was repeatedly given what she viewed as gendered feedback and promised promotions that never materialized. Once, when she pushed back on a comment her manager made in a review, he said, “Don’t contradict me in front of the kids,” referring to her direct reports. He also would tell her to “be more professional” when she disagreed with him in meetings. The woman says she reported these experiences to HR, but nothing changed. Eventually, she found out she was making roughly $100,000 less than a male colleague just one level above her who did comparable work, and she decided to quit. She asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yfFr8"&gt;A different form of alleged pay disparity is also felt on the support team. According to an employee who recently left, the department is one of the most diverse factions of the company — but it’s also one of the lowest paid. One senior staffer said they made just $48,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="txNWCC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck8agv"&gt;Employees also say it’s difficult to move out of these positions. While most corporate employees work out of the glitzy Ponce City Market — a mixed-use space filled with shops and restaurants — the support team works in an old building two and a half miles away, making it difficult to forge connections with other teams. “The support team was treated like the custodians,” a former staffer says. “Everyone loves and respects the custodian. They’re a friendly face when you walk in the door. But no one has any interest in promoting the custodian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXBdbX"&gt;“It feels like you’re the lowest rung on the ladder,” a current employee adds. “When you see people of color, women, LGBTQ people in this department it feels really shitty. We’re hidden away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU4Xam"&gt;In response to this assertion, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “In our view, career progression isn’t about moving out of the Customer department, but growing within it.” Mailchimp also said other departments of the company have more gender diversity than customer service, but it did not comment specifically on racial or LGBTQ diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr6YjO"&gt;Still, working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta. For many employees in the support department, it’s their first corporate job, and some say they are drawn in by the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the Herman Miller chairs. When the pandemic hit and people started working from home, those superficial perks evaporated. “When all those things were taken away I realized I didn’t like this job that much,” the former worker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F86s9s"&gt;Given their disparate environment, not all members of the support team were sympathetic to Kelly Ellis’ complaints. After she posted a photo of an expensive Lego set on Twitter, one wrote “can you imagine the cognitive dissonance it takes to spend ~48 hours being upset over pay and then tweeting about an $800 Lego set...while people who make 1/3rd of your pay clean up some mess you made?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeyvDm"&gt;The story about a white woman getting outsized attention for discrimination in the tech industry isn’t new. In August 2020, Françoise Brougher, former COO of Pinterest, sued the company for gender discrimination, eventually getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;a $22.5 million settlement&lt;/a&gt;. She brought her complaints after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;two Black women on the policy team&lt;/a&gt; — Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks — spoke out about discrimination at the company. Ozoma and Banks received less than a year’s severance when they left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bSjdyx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dz2LPq"&gt;For Angelo Ragin, however, Ellis’ experience was validating. He’d voiced some of the same concerns in 2014 when he’d advocated for a pay raise and was told he was being entitled. His concerns about pay, while old, are echoed by current Mailchimp staffers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdCp3S"&gt;Ragin was the first Black employee at Mailchimp. He started on the tech support team in 2009 before moving to the IT department. The role fit Ragin’s background: he’d previously worked on the Geek Squad at Best Buy and was an expert in Apple software and products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCGCjB"&gt;One of the key metrics on the IT team was how many tickets agents solved. Mailchimp employees would write in with technical issues, and it was up to the team to resolve them as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtHGP"&gt;Ragin says he was often in the top two agents in regard to tickets solved — a claim backed up by ticket count statistics from 2015. He says he was the guy Mailchimp’s founders, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius, would go to when they had technical concerns. So when he found out he was making 14 percent less than his white colleagues, Ragin was shocked. He asked to be bumped up to their level, which the company did, bringing his total compensation to $68,400 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m0A23"&gt;Still, Ragin felt like the work he was doing warranted more. “I was the go-to guy,” he says. “I would walk in the office and be going 100 percent all day. My goal was to change the perception of IT, because people needed to trust in the IT department so they feel fully equipped and educated about what kind of stuff they have in front of them.” He wanted to make $80,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3Ua37"&gt;In his review in 2014, his manager said that the company had already bumped him up 14 percent, and “with bonuses, company-paid health insurance and other perks the total compensation package easily puts Angelo well on the way, if not already in excess of, his $80K/year long term goal.” He refused to further increase Ragin’s pay. Ragin was then chided for advocating for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation. It’s great that he’s confident but some people might misread his self-confidence as arrogance or a sense of entitlement.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKlg9cd6Dz0UaYBSEOVhKRHi5V0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328070/management.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback Angelo Ragin got from a manager in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJl8i7"&gt;Another manager wrote in the review: “Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkxFUv"&gt;The following year, Mailchimp recorded $280 million in revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/mailchimp-and-the-un-silicon-valley-way-to-make-it-as-a-start-up.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzbjZ5"&gt;Earlier on in his tenure, Ragin had taken a week off due to a difficult situation in his family. When he returned to the office, he says he was called out for not responding to tickets while he was away. “That crushed me,” he says. “I was just like ‘are you serious?’ Especially because I’m your token Black kid, I’m the one you put on a poster when you go to job fairs to say you’re diverse. You’re not diverse, you just have me here.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgYA2gjcptYNabm6Cj3ColdzAyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328062/MailChimp_Job_Poster.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angelo Ragin on a Mailchimp recruiting poster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6W8ymv"&gt;Ragin was also beginning to tire of small slights that piled up from white colleagues. Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers. A few years earlier, he’d started a side business repairing iPhone screens and selling accessories to support his family. One day, another Mailchimp employee began joking about him having the accessories piled in his car and asked if he was hawking toilet paper or paper towels, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ids36r"&gt;Ragin decided to send a letter to Mailchimp’s co-founders to voice his concerns. “It’s hard to walk into a company you love and have loved for so long, feeling like you’re going to do your best to have a good day but you’re expecting some sort of uncomfortable comment from someone and you just have to swallow your feelings for the sake of not being labeled as ‘aggressive’ or ‘defensive’ by your peers so you just keep quiet,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppLKCF"&gt;Mailchimp eventually decided to roll out unconscious bias training and enlisted Ragin’s support. He was glad to advise on the curriculum but was not compensated for the extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC9k0M"&gt;While the bias training is now available for all employees, some staffers say the company still has more work to do. On the anonymous forum Blind, some have been discussing a perceived exodus of Black employees in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s evident that our beige C suite is too busy counting Calendly’s bag (re: Ben’s gross Slack message about Tope last week) to be bothered that they have been hemorrhaging black talent (#blaxodus) pre-covid or even consider validating the terrible experiences of marginalized employees by implementing anti-racist systems." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9eXvM4GS9j-nMqeUIECQro1HfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328069/screenshot_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comments in Blind, an anonymous employee forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U28ex0"&gt;This perception could be related to the growth of Atlanta’s tech scene, which is giving employees more options of where to work. In January, CEO Ben Chestnut sent a Slack message to staff about a company called Calendly that had recently raised $350 million in funding. “It can be easy to look at companies like Calendly and feel like the grass is always greener and the wins come easier,” he wrote. “That’s not the case — we’ve got our phasers set to win and if anyone’s got green, it’s us!” He ended with a rocket emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOf0HO"&gt;His comments were not meant for Luaces or Ragin. Both had left the company by this point: Luaces to run her own &lt;a href="https://www.hellyeahglutenfree.com/"&gt;bakery called Hell Yeah Gluten Free&lt;/a&gt; and Ragin to start his own consulting business. Ragin never got the promotion he was asking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64z7q1"&gt;It’s a reality that even employees speaking out publicly cannot change. However much Mailchimp improves, two people of color who genuinely loved the company when they first arrived are now working outside the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9dyPQC"&gt;Ragin says that his experience at Mailchimp even prompted him to go to therapy for depression. “I questioned myself, I questioned my work, I questioned my ability, because every time you get to the next level, they move the bar,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="daiysG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Two names were changed to protect the identities of those involved &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
