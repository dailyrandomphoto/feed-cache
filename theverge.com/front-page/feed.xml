    <title>Extreme heat is a growing concern for doctors around the world</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hYXHk1"&gt;Extreme heat is a huge worry&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for doctors and public health experts around the world, and it’s steadily become a bigger problem over time, according to a sweeping new climate &lt;a href="https://www.thelancet.com/countdown-health-climate"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; published today in the leading medical journal, &lt;em&gt;The Lancet.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7NAat"&gt;The analysis, from 43 academic institutions and United Nations agencies, focuses on the threats the climate crisis poses to human health. While the group has published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22007541/climate-change-health-disaster-doctors-lancet-report"&gt;similar reports&lt;/a&gt; over the past five years, this is the first time it includes warnings on the impact hotter days have on mental health and physical activity. It follows an increase in devastating heatwaves around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="MnkXd3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5gljbo"&gt;“I saw paramedics who had burns on their knees from kneeling down to care for patients with heatstroke. I saw far too many patients die in the ED as a result of their heat exposure this past year,” Jeremy Hess, a professor of environmental and occupational health sciences, global health and emergency medicine at the University of Washington, said during a press briefing this week. “These are preventable problems, and we need all hands on deck to respond and correct our course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVTK6C"&gt;Extreme heat is already a leading weather-related killer, and climate change is making heatwaves more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;frequent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;intense&lt;/a&gt;. Children and older adults especially are more vulnerable to heat-related illness and death than people of other ages. Babies under the age of one and adults over 65 experienced dramatically more days of heatwaves in 2020 compared to the baseline average from 1986 to 2005, according to the new report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQhtx1"&gt;The number of hours in a day in which it was too hot to safely work or exercise outside has also risen steadily over the past four decades, the report found. People in lower-income countries lost the most time, an average of 3.7 fewer hours in a day with safe temperatures. In 2020 alone, 295 billion hours of potential work were lost because of extreme heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D02Byf"&gt;Governments are now trying to find ways to help their populations cope with the heat. The United States last month announced plans to craft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22683791/us-workers-extreme-heat-stress-workplace-protections-federal-labor-standard-osha"&gt;new protections&lt;/a&gt; for workers faced with sweltering conditions. To get the public better prepared for dangerously high temperatures, officials in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/10/19/seville-spain-heat-wave-names/"&gt;Seville&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637914/greece-heatwaves-names"&gt;Athens&lt;/a&gt; recently announced that they are looking into giving heatwaves names. It’s similar to the tactic used to keep people updated on hazards posed by major storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjoyhU"&gt;But physical health isn’t the only heat-related concern for doctors involved with the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; report. “There are pretty clear signals in the literature overall that extreme heat exposure is a risk for a number of different mental health concerns. This extends up to and includes suicide,” Hess said. “So it’s been a real interest for a while in the climate and health community to get a better sense of exactly who is at risk, what those risks look like, and how to track them over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuRLkK"&gt;Twitter gave the &lt;em&gt;Lancet&lt;/em&gt; paper’s researchers one window into how people’s sentiments changed during hot days.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They studied 6 billion geolocated tweets sent from 40,000 different locations between 2015 to 2020. During heatwaves, they found a rise in “negative sentiment” and a decrease in “positive sentiment” in people’s tweets. To do that, they used a standard &lt;a href="https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/31333/LIWC2015_LanguageManual.pdf"&gt;research method&lt;/a&gt; that essentially counts the number of words deemed positive or negative in tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbgayG"&gt;Over time, people only grew more “negative” during heatwaves. “If people were adapting globally to the effects of heat, we would expect, over time, the impact of a heatwave on people’s emotional states would be attenuated,” says Kelton Minor, another co-author of the report and a PhD candidate at the University of Copenhagen’s Center for Social Data Science. Instead, they found a 155 percent jump in “negative expressions” on Twitter during heatwaves in 2020 compared to the average from 2015 to 2019 (even when controlling for other stressors like COVID-19). “The scale of the impact of heatwaves on negative sentiment is not marginal; this is a sort of large increase,” Minor says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G5Fpkg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to shine a light on the hidden corners of the true mental health impacts of climate change.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mosH47"&gt;“We need to shine a light on the hidden corners of the true mental health impacts of climate change. We know that it is impacting mental health, and this is a first step on that road in order to better understand it,” Renee Salas, an attending physician in the Department of Emergency Medicine and an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Harvard Medical School, said in the press briefing on the new report.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Segway’s ‘Mecha Kit’ turns your transporter into a rolling turret</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mecha Kit on Segway" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtmAOg2ts9JSLV9dCmUINbMyMjc=/12x0:1988x1317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023358/mecha_kit_demonstration_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7bGwi"&gt;If you ever wanted to transform your self-balancing scooter into a mobile mini mech, now you can with Segway-Ninebot’s Mecha Kit add-on. The kit is compatible with the Ninebot S and Ninebot S Kids and puts you in the pilot seat of your scooter-turned-turret.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Mecha Kit on Segway" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pupx-U93ne4X9CLWw_rcqdQiFDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943300/mecha_kit_demonstration_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6rsAyH"&gt;Once fitted onto your vehicle, you no longer have to stand up to drive. You can stay seated while you control your movement with dual joysticks and take aim at targets with beads of gel. And yes, it acts just like a mech — you’re able to shoot the semi-evaporating bullets while driving, spinning and drifting around. If that still doesn’t sound awesome enough, you can even customize the Mecha Kit’s RGB underglow lighting, as well as switch on some music via the built-in Bluetooth sound system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHTcs5"&gt;Segway claims that the bullets are environmentally friendly and evaporate into a powder that leaves no mess behind. You’ll get around 60,000 gel bullets included with the Mecha Kit, but it remains unclear how to order refills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Water bullets" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTrBPmoIyqCx6Um1POcfcrbFq6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943249/mecha_kit_water_bullets.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The water bullets evaporate into a powder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4VoWk2"&gt;You can also connect the Mecha Kit with the Segway-Ninebot mobile app to control your vehicle remotely. The kit’s steel frame is built to “prevent deformation” and can carry passengers up to 220 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ghbQ"&gt;While the people you pass on your daily commute probably wouldn’t appreciate the barrage of gel bullets coming their way, having mecha-style battles with other Segway-owning friends and family members sounds like a lot of fun, whether for kids or adults. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Segway-Ninebot Mecha Kit up close" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/giaNjomXoDkvXkJjn8xodnY-Bh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943160/segway_ninebot_mecha_kit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Segway-Ninebot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bZ55fz"&gt;The Mecha Kit is available for purchase on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.segway.com%2Fninebot-mecha-kit&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22737058%2Fsegway-mecha-kit-rolling-water-gun-turret" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Segway-Ninebot’s website for $599.99&lt;/a&gt;, but right now, it’s on sale for $499.99. If you were to purchase the full-priced Mecha Kit with either the Segway Ninebot S or S Kids, it will cost you around $1,000. For more specifics about the Mecha Kit, you can check out all the details in the user manual on the Mecha Kit’s product page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTOTVr"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Segway decided to get a little creative with its vehicles. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/15/17571466/segway-ninebot-reportedly-making-go-kart-kit-for-scooters"&gt;the company tried turning Segways into go-karts&lt;/a&gt;. All that’s missing from this Mecha Kit are a couple of jets so we can get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlaCGX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s Boring Company gets green light for Las Vegas tunnel system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-hDJZHmqJ-RF02fknQDDhX1Tw0k=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023129/IMG_20210222_152813_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WwbpdX"&gt;Elon Musk’s Boring Company just won approval from local officials to move forward with building a network of vehicle tunnels underneath Las Vegas. Dubbed the “Vegas Loop,” the system will allow passengers to hitch rides in Teslas to and from places like the hotel casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, the city’s new football stadium, the Las Vegas Convention Center, and McCarran International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TwIHp"&gt;The Boring Company already operates a small version of this “Teslas in Tunnels” system underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455365/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-test-lvcc-loop-teslas"&gt;opened earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; and involves two 0.8-mile tunnels. But Musk’s startup proposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;a massive city-wide expansion in December 2020&lt;/a&gt; that largely lines up with what Clark County officials approved Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KTHft"&gt;The system that was approved involves 29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations. Clark County says as many as 57,000 passengers will be able to travel through it per hour and that no taxpayer money will be spent to build it. The Boring Company previously said that it would foot the bill for building the main tunnels but planned to ask hotel casinos or other businesses that want a station to pay for those construction costs. Each one of those stops has to go through its own permitting process, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/traffic/boring-co-s-plans-for-underground-loop-in-resort-corridor-approved-2463119/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Las Vegas Review-Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ToHMVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;29 miles of tunnels and 51 stations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="85eKSd"&gt;The Boring Company has been working to build out a system of tunnels underneath Las Vegas &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18636326/las-vegas-people-mover-lvcc-boring-company"&gt;for a few years now&lt;/a&gt;. Over that time, Musk’s ambitions for what a tunnel-based transportation system would look like has changed. He once imagined using sleds to shuttle cars from the surface to the tunnels and back, as well as pods that would give &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/9/17102452/elon-musk-boring-company-pedestrian-cyclist-focus"&gt;preference to cyclists and pedestrians&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the company’s efforts to dig in other places have fizzled, like in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics"&gt;Chicago&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boring-company-scrubbed-la-and-dc-tunnels-from-site-2021-4#:~:text=The%20Boring%20Company%20removed%20its,hyperloops%20because%20of%20environmental%20regulations."&gt;Los Angeles, and the Northeast corridor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kLJ4U"&gt;But the final version that was built under the Las Vegas Convention Center is really just “Teslas in Tunnels” — a phrase The Boring Company even uses on its own website. The Boring Company has said the plan is to ultimately use Teslas that can drive themselves, but Musk’s other company has not yet finished creating software capable of performing that feat. So, currently, the Teslas that run under the Convention Center have human drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DYGL3s"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Expanding and moving forward with plans for the "Vegas Loop." &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ClarkCounty?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ClarkCounty&lt;/a&gt; Commissioners just approved an agreement with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; to establish and maintain a transportation system that will go under the Las Vegas Strip. It will also go to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AllegiantStadm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AllegiantStadm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/unlv?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@UNLV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/2ju3xcFq7O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2ju3xcFq7O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Clark County Nevada (@ClarkCountyNV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1450877187779796992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVSZD3"&gt;An expansion beyond the Convention Center loop didn’t initially seem likely, as the Las Vegas Monorail had exclusive rights to provide transportation along the city’s main stretch of resorts. But the company that ran the monorail went bankrupt in 2020. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority bought up the monorail and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;subsequently killed the noncompete agreement&lt;/a&gt; that prevented The Boring Company from pursuing a larger project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyYT2b"&gt;As for why tunnels are a better solution than other transit options, The Boring Company makes this pitch on its website: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4mZuY"&gt;To solve the problem of soul-destroying traffic, roads must go 3D, which means either flying cars or tunnels are needed. Unlike flying cars, tunnels are weatherproof, out of sight, and won’t fall on your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u2HLi"&gt;Tunnels minimize usage of valuable surface land and do not conflict with existing transportation systems. A large network of tunnels can alleviate congestion in any city; no matter how large a city grows, more levels of tunnels can be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ih8Twj"&gt;The Boring Company has previously quoted price estimates for the Vegas Loop system that sit somewhere between that of most public transit and the cost of a taxi or ride-hailing service. It expects a five-mile trip from the airport to the Convention Center to take about five minutes and cost $10, and a 3.6-mile ride from the Convention Center to the football stadium to take four minutes and cost $6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears boosters for Moderna and J&amp;J COVID-19 vaccines  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_hfbqFyxuTSTSL9nMWYQiPvo0PE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70023093/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FVP9QB"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-additional-actions-use-booster-dose-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; booster doses for the Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679950/fda-covid-vaccine-booster-pfizer-older-adults"&gt;authorization&lt;/a&gt; of a third Pfizer / BioNTech shot in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zuARzn"&gt;The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-additional-actions-use-booster-dose-covid-19-vaccines"&gt;also said today&lt;/a&gt; that it will allow “mix-and-match” boosters — eligible people who are already fully vaccinated can get a booster dose of any of the three vaccines, regardless of which they started with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QUWCv"&gt;As with the Pfizer / BioNTech booster, the FDA cleared third Moderna shots for vulnerable groups, including people 65 years of age and older, those who are at high risk of severe disease, and people at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W01Htz"&gt;The booster for the Moderna vaccine, though, will be a half-dose. Both vaccines are mRNA vaccines that contain tiny snippets of the coronavirus’ genetic material. But the Moderna vaccine has a larger dose: it’s 100 micrograms, compared with the 30 micrograms in the Pfizer / BioNTech shot. The company says a third, 50 microgram half-dose of the Moderna vaccine could have fewer side effects while still giving strong protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niLvRo"&gt;Research shows that the Moderna shots have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/health/covid-moderna-pfizer-vaccines.html"&gt;more durable protection&lt;/a&gt; against infection from COVID-19 than the Pfizer / BioNTech shots — they stay more effective months after the initial two-shot series, while the efficacy for the Pfizer / BioNTech shots appears to drop off. Both maintain strong protection against hospitalization and death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkGTXf"&gt;The FDA is opening up second, booster doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to everyone who got that shot. Boosters for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine can start two months after the first dose, unlike the six-month wait for the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna boosters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WLdvWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosters for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine can also start two months after the first dose, unlike the six-month wait for the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna boosters. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bIOnTE"&gt;The Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22301558/covid-vaccine-one-dose-johnson-fda-approval"&gt;originally authorized&lt;/a&gt; as a one-shot vaccine, which experts hoped would make it logistically easier to deliver to low-resource areas and to give to people who may not want to come back for a second shot. Still, only around 15 million people in the United States have been immunized with this vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcvJGi"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine works by inserting a section of the coronavirus gene into a harmless virus, called an adenovirus, which then delivers the gene to the body’s cells. Initial clinical trials showed that it worked well enough to leave experts confident it would be protective, although its results weren’t as strong as&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna shots. But a recent real-world study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that a single shot of Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson’s vaccine was only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7038e1.htm?s_cid=mm7038e1_w"&gt;71 percent&lt;/a&gt; effective against hospitalization — lower than the protection against hospitalization from the mRNA vaccines. &lt;a href="https://www.livescience.com/breakthrough-infections-different-covid-19-vaccines.html"&gt;Data also appears to show&lt;/a&gt; that people who got that vaccine were also more likely to have breakthrough infections than people who received the gene-based shots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2UUUv"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson says that a second booster dose &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/health/johnson-and-johnson-shot.html"&gt;bumps the vaccine’s efficacy&lt;/a&gt; against symptomatic cases of COVID-19 to 94 percent, in line with the initial clinical trial results for the gene-based shots. The FDA cleared the additional shot even though the agency was critical of the quality of data provided by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/health/johnson-vaccine-booster-fda.html?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur"&gt;in its initial evaluation&lt;/a&gt; of the need for a booster. The agency said that the test used to check antibody levels in people who got a second dose wasn’t sensitive enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IPnu3"&gt;Today’s announcement gives people who got the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot more options than just getting a second shot of the same. Those people may have a stronger antibody response if they take advantage of the FDA’s decision to allow a mix-and-match approach to boosters. A &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/10/mix-match-booster-covid-vaccine/620395/"&gt;federally funded study&lt;/a&gt; showed that for that group, boosting with an mRNA vaccine generates more antibodies than boosting with a second Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mBYNn"&gt;People who got either of the mRNA vaccines for their first shots and a different mRNA shot for their boosters showed similarly high antibody levels. Mixing and matching was safe, the study showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tZZrLC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mixing and matching was safe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqqSAi"&gt;The data is consistent with research out of the United Kingdom, where people have been mixing the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine (which isn’t used in the US, but that works through the same mechanism as the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot) with the Pfizer / BioNTech shot for months. Having one shot of each produces just as high or higher antibody levels than two shots of either, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01805-2"&gt;studies showed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMPICC"&gt;There’s a small caveat to all of this. The studies measured antibody levels, not real-world protection from disease. Because other immune cells help block severe illness, even if antibody levels drop off, additional research is still needed to see how well the various mixing regimens actually prevent COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHrGOP"&gt;“We will work to accrue additional data as quickly as possible to further assess the benefits and risks of the use of booster doses in additional populations and plan to update the healthcare community and public with our determination in the coming weeks,” Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22nC6I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lr2Wcj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPheY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon offers up more data to tell third-party sellers which items will be popular</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7HVp6Jr_bnIZmVvwSY3fEt3feJE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022179/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HaR7MP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/today-amazon-accelerate-amazon-announces-product-opportunity"&gt;Amazon has announced a tool&lt;/a&gt; that will give sellers access to information about what shoppers are currently looking for and help make it easier to choose which products to create next. Amazon calls it the Product Opportunity Explorer and says that it’ll give sellers access to data and trends that will help them “identify opportunities to launch new, high-potential products to serve unmet customer demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlP6va"&gt;With Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/9/19/20874818/amazon-allbirds-shoe-clone-copy-sneaker-206-collective-private-label"&gt;track record&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;copying popular products&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"&gt;selling them under its Amazon Basics brand&lt;/a&gt;, an obvious concern with this tool is where the data is coming from and how granular it is. While Amazon quotes a seller saying that they’re excited to get “recommendations specifically relevant” to their business, it’s easy to imagine other sellers being nervous that Amazon’s suggestions could direct businesses to rip off existing products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2SvmM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon Basics’ history could make some sellers nervous about the company providing product development recommendations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oA7K29"&gt;However, an Amazon spokesperson speaking to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; claims that the tool will be giving sellers aggregated data that won’t give out specifics about how other brands are doing. Instead, the company says that the tool will give suggestions for products that perhaps customers are searching for, but not finding. For example, if a company sells bikes on Amazon, and there’s demand for a blue bike for preteen girls, the tool may recommend that they try to sell that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zw7bwK"&gt;The tool will also give broader category and subcategory metrics, such as what people are searching for, pricing trends, and the like. In its press release, Amazon says that the tool gives sellers “rich insights into what customers are searching for, clicking on, and buying, as well as not buying,” along with “detailed data on search volume and growth, sales history, and pricing trends.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvqzVl"&gt;For its part, Amazon has denied in the past that it abuses its dual role as a product developer and marketplace provider. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558119/amazon-european-union-antitrust-charges-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;The EU has accused Amazon&lt;/a&gt; of “systematically” using data from its marketplace that others can’t get. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724152/amazon-india-search-result-rigging-reference-product-seller-data-report"&gt;recent report about Amazon India&lt;/a&gt; alleges even more egregious behavior there. The EU commission hasn’t released a report or findings stemming from the accusations, and Amazon has pushed back against both accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4TzeC1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Basics ripped off accessories, now Amazon is coming for gadgets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22701965/amazon-fitbit-ecobee-basics-design-halo-view-smart-thermostat-clone-ripoff-regulators"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QP962K"&gt;There are also other minor concerns — if everyone has access to the same data or gets similar recommendations, could it start more algorithm-directed arms races between sellers to be the first to try to fill a perceived niche? And could Amazon risk damage to its relationship with sellers if the data predicts a product will do well, but it ends up totally flopping? The company may have the opportunity to figure those questions out before they become real problems, though; it will test the Product Opportunity Explorer in beta before releasing it for free to all sellers in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1P6ZN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 5:07PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information from Amazon about what kind of metrics and recommendations the tool will provide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard discrimination case shouldn’t halt over agency feud, California argues in new court filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard employees stage a walkout in the response from company leadership to a lawsuit highlighting alleged harassment, inequality" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4A1GTygyPv66Px2UXZwhc4YsvNM=/0x181:4200x2981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022943/1234303832.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AxpRf6"&gt;After Activision Blizzard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735273/activision-blizzard-requests-stay-in-harassment-lawsuit-alleging-conflict-of-interest"&gt;requested a stay&lt;/a&gt; in the discrimination case brought against it by the state of California, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has filed its response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPdqqU"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s request for a stay asserts that lawyers with the DFEH engaged in misconduct arising from a conflict of interest. According to the filing, some of the lawyers working on the case had previously worked on a separate case against the company when they were employed by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (or EEOC). Such an arrangement, Activision Blizzard argues, is in violation of a California state bar conflict of interest rule. As a result, the discrimination case should be put on hold until the conflict is settled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXaBYs"&gt;Today in the superior court of California, the DFEH filed its response: “Activision hopes to conjure a scandal from these mundane facts, based on an aggressive misreading of California Rules of Professional Conduct.” Both the objection and DFEH’s response are only arguments, and have no legal force without a ruling from the court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="miRr9v"&gt;The DFEH argues that the two lawyers in question had little involvement in the EEOC’s investigation of Activision Blizzard during their time there. Even if there were a conflict, the filing continues, the lawyers in question have already been taken off the case and the DFEH is being represented in this case by an outside law firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8m2HsX"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s objection arises from a conflict between the two employment agencies that have filed suit against the company. Earlier this month, EEOC brought the alleged conflict of interest to light after the DFEH tried to intervene in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;$18 million dollar settlement&lt;/a&gt; between the EEOC and Activision Blizzard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gp5s0"&gt;The DFEH argues that the settlement is premature and that the EEOC did not investigate the matter properly before providing Activision Blizzard with the option to settle. Furthermore, the DFEH claims interference was necessary because the settlement between Activision Blizzard and the EEOC which, again, is a federal agency, could protect it from litigation already filed on behalf of the state — in this case the DFEH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ANtHh"&gt;The EEOC told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it has no comment beyond its filings and the DFEH says it cannot comment on an open case. In a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/10/20/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-dfeh-eeoc-feud/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a former Blizzard employee says the matter “feels incredibly bad all over.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at Microsoft’s new Windows 11 Android apps support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDYaBVrY8eI4X3UkT2TULmacBBA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022861/thumbnail_v3_notext.5.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FCMpny"&gt;Microsoft has released the first preview version of its Android apps support in Windows 11. It’s available to testers in the Beta Channel version of Windows 11, which means you’ll need to opt into the Windows Insider program to get access. I’ve installed the preview version on two systems — a gaming rig with a Core i9 11900K and Microsoft’s Surface Pro X — to get a feel for exactly how well Android apps run on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpVgkK"&gt;The experience of installing apps is very simple. Microsoft has partnered with Amazon, so the Microsoft Store will list apps but send you over to Amazon’s Appstore app to get them installed or updated. This also installs a Windows Subsystem for Android in the background, which is the core technology that powers Android apps running on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnSdFLSghwYftFmrK7dQtqQSJ8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943047/android1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Subsystem for Android powers the entire experience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIGD8V"&gt;Apps effectively run in a virtual machine, contained within their own world but able to sit side by side with other Windows apps. You can pin Android apps to the Start menu or taskbar and use all of the windowing and multitasking features of Windows 11 just like a regular desktop app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEs2Xe"&gt;While there are only 50 apps officially available in this preview, I was able to install Amazon’s Kindle app, the BBC Sounds app, and a bunch of games to test just how well Windows 11 handles mobile games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kx7caR"&gt;On both the Surface Pro X (an Arm-powered device) and my Intel-powered gaming rig, apps ran surprisingly well. I was able to run them alongside Word, Chrome, and other desktop apps, as if they were just regular Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbWLR7fj_eqqOsux2bAfSx2G4Pk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943049/android2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps and games running side by side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sFifJo"&gt;Apps show up in search results as if they were regular Windows ones, and the integration into the Start menu and taskbar makes them feel just like any other app. It’s surprisingly seamless and a well-integrated solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7U1C91"&gt;The preview isn’t perfect, though. I noticed 100 percent CPU utilization when I attempted to get four Android games running side by side using Windows 11’s Snap Layouts feature on my gaming PC. Everything suddenly felt laggy, until seconds later it sprung back to life and the CPU usage went back to normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svltAK"&gt;Likewise, games didn’t seem to run very well on the Surface Pro X with low frame rates and stuttering. This is a preview though, so I’d hope to see performance improve before this ships to all Windows 11 users.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u9UPf1gxea08VpKcyO8tPHYvXXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943053/android3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Appstore is the only official way to get Android apps on Windows 11 outside of sideloading.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yh3jE2"&gt;I also noticed in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV &lt;/em&gt;that the game reloads when you attempt to resize it, and some apps and games don’t resize particularly well. It all depends on how developers have built their apps, but expect most to run best in phone-like dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIZN1t"&gt;The question is whether you actually want or need Android apps. I personally only need a handful, like the Kindle app or some smart home apps, but it’s the Android mobile games that are more interesting to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTA2qM"&gt;Bluestacks has supported Android apps on Windows for years, and the company has leaned heavily into supporting mobile games on Windows. Microsoft is late to the party here, but its subsystem is clearly the result of years of work to extend Windows to running Linux kernels and GUI apps. While Microsoft is busy getting Android apps on Windows 11 working, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701930/bluestacks-x-android-games-browser-free-cloud-gaming"&gt;Bluestacks is now in the process&lt;/a&gt; of bringing Android apps into the browser and running them in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4x55XyCSsi19IgJ4Zzg5mgzI-xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22943060/android4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android apps can run alongside Windows apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dfiRLG"&gt;Microsoft’s Android apps support relies on the Amazon Appstore for now, which has only a fraction of the apps available on Google’s Play Store. It’s inevitable that someone will sideload this onto Windows 11 and unlock many more apps with it, but Microsoft won’t officially be supporting this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vfdMy"&gt;Still, the initial preview is a lot more complete and smooth (on the right hardware) than I expected. Microsoft’s initial release to the Beta Channel of Windows Insider also suggests this might appear for everyone using Windows 11 a lot sooner than we expected.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV’s news app expands free local coverage to a lot more places</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kKR8ISWZ6F_cZmHPwEzZYGyX_fQ=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022763/1_MswigxHbznGaVa0XDbIiZw.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2G1vP8"&gt;Amazon announced today that it’s doubling the number of local stations it supports through its news app on Fire TV, meaning more users will be able to easily find local news coverage for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmvS0I"&gt;The company said in a &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that this week’s coverage expansion will make local news available in 158 total US cities. That’s up from coverage in 88 cities following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337922/amazon-fire-tv-free-local-news-streaming-app"&gt;previous expansion&lt;/a&gt; in March. As of today, the number of local stations available through the news app has hiked from 126 to 259. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JmgXi5"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson clarified that some metro areas offer more than one local station in the Amazon news app on Fire TV. The company said that more than 50 metro areas now offer more than one local news source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08a7LZ"&gt;The news app is free and supported on all Fire TV devices, the company said. No extra steps need to be taken to get regional access in your area. Amazon says users can simply navigate to the local news tab from within the news app, and the player will add the station or stations for the closest supported city and automatically dial it in. (Asking Alexa to “play local news” will also launch the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zFuOFU"&gt;Amazon has pretty quickly expanded its free and local news coverage since &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazons-news-app-now-supports-local-news-7b96b7978fee"&gt;launching support&lt;/a&gt; in 12 cities last year. Like many free live TV services from streamers including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;The Roku Channel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577727/plex-15-new-tv-channels"&gt;Plex TV&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552590/viacomcbs-streaming-paramount-plus-earnings-q3-license-pluto-tv-competition"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s free and customizable news app is ad-supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBb2pY"&gt;As of this week, local news coverage will now be supported in Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Memphis, Miami, New Orleans, and dozens of other cities. The full list of new metro areas that can now watch local news through Fire TV’s news app can be found &lt;a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/amazon-news-app-now-has-free-local-news-coverage-in-158-cities-d7d56216ca72"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar is backing the Facebook whistleblower</title>

  &lt;p id="ocL0Gm"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;testified in front of Congress two weeks ago&lt;/a&gt; about the ways the company’s products can bring harm to users after leaking documents supporting her claims to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the SEC. Now &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/20/tech-billionaire-aiding-facebook-whistleblower-516358"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that the campaign to support Haugen’s advocacy has been aided by eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar, as she takes on the place where she previously worked as a product manager assigned to the Civic Integrity group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ad8vAk"&gt;Omidyar is no stranger to the media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/19/5227900/pierre-omidyars-news-project-gets-a-name-and-a-business-model"&gt;providing financial backing to&lt;em&gt; The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and the open internet advocacy group &lt;a href="https://www.publicknowledge.org/"&gt;Public Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;, when asked to comment, his advocacy group Omidyar Network &lt;a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c"&gt;pointed to an unbylined blog post&lt;/a&gt; that went up today titled “In Support of Tech Whistleblowers Who are Holding Tech to Account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HUA59"&gt;If you’re looking for a “why” behind the impactful rollout of Haugen’s testimony and the Facebook Files reported by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://medium.com/omidyar-network/in-support-of-tech-whistleblowers-who-are-holding-tech-to-account-7fa5f66eac1c"&gt;the blog post&lt;/a&gt; lays out clear intentions for the machine behind everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWTJTR"&gt;“With little competition, regulation, or other countervailing checks and balances, Big Tech has too much influence. Until recently, these platforms largely avoided meaningful public oversight, which has allowed them to do as they wish, often at the expense of consumers, start-ups, and their employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em9htF"&gt;“Even as Big Tech’s reach has extended further and faster, it has remained largely opaque. We have had a nagging feeling that the harms they cause are known to them — and are far worse than the public could imagine. That has been validated as truth by a series of courageous whistleblowers who have spoken out and delivered evidence of wrongdoing and misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p50VT4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook encourages hate speech for profit, says whistleblower ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"},{"title":"The whistleblower hearing hits Facebook where the company is weakest ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EbP1se"&gt;The level of polish and coordination accompanying the rollout of the files has been evident, inviting open speculation about who is making Facebook’s nightmare month possible. Omidyar’s participation isn’t exactly a surprise — the Network &lt;a href="https://omidyar.com/news/roadmap-for-an-antitrust-case-against-facebook/"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a 39-page PDF last year titled “Roadmap for an Antitrust Case Against Facebook.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq3b6e"&gt;It’s unlikely that Omidyar and associated organizations are the only ones in play here either, as &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; notes that Haugen’s schedule puts her, and her files, in front of a UK Parliament committee next week. Appearances in France and Belgium will follow next month, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;an appointment with Facebook’s Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have a date yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vI8mIW"&gt;That’s not even including an impending release of articles by multiple media outlets that Facebook communications VP John Pinette &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1450154006727200771"&gt;referred to as a “gotcha campaign”&lt;/a&gt; without describing what his company has been caught doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSdMn1"&gt;Haugen’s method — and her proposed solutions for the problems she identifies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712512/facebook-whistleblower-testimony-analysis-congress-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;can fall into more than one category&lt;/a&gt;. Still, a carefully executed media rollout has, so far, kept her claims from being ignored or forgotten. Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737081/facebook-instagram-mark-zuckerberg-testify-senate-child-safety-frances-haugen"&gt;sent out a request for Mark Zuckerberg and other Facebook execs to testify&lt;/a&gt; in response to the information revealed in the files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qiMSw4"&gt;

    <title>Tesla bucks chip shortage woes with another profitable quarter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model X redesign" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V259KuKqYZ2nsCvV02nNbB7F7fk=/90x0:2790x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70022625/MX_Exterior_Hero_Desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUDDl2"&gt;Tesla’s record third quarter brought its biggest three-month windfall ever, as the company &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/TWPKBV_TSLA_Q3_2021_Quarterly_Update_SI1AKE.pdf"&gt;announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it turned a $1.6 billion profit. That’s despite a global semiconductor shortage and delays in the rollout of the refreshed Model S sedan and Model X SUV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zXTeK"&gt;Tesla turned that profit on just over $13.7 billion in revenue, and did it while its average sales price continued to drop due to the increasing popularity of the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDw3ET"&gt;Tesla has also continued to increase the profitability of those vehicles. The company said Wednesday that the gross margin on its cars is up to nearly 30 percent — a figure it has reached in large part thanks to its efforts in China, as it recently started &lt;a href="https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/tesla-will-export-model-y-china-europe-amid-german-plant-delays"&gt;exporting low-cost models built there to other markets like Europe&lt;/a&gt;, CFO Zach Kirkhorn said on the company’s earnings call. Increasing production and sales of the refreshed Model S also helped, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sx8GFN"&gt;What’s more, Tesla is making more money on its cars even though it reduced the amount of regulatory credits it sold this quarter ($279 million this quarter, versus $354 million in Q2). Kirkhorn also said Wednesday that Tesla continues to hold off on counting some of the money it has collected for the $10,000 “Full Self-Driving” software — which remains incomplete — as revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tbm6Py"&gt;Tesla’s success in the quarter stands in stark relief from the trouble other automakers have faced thanks to the chip shortage and larger global supply chain crunches. General Motors’ sales in the US dropped 33 percent compared to the same period last year, while Ford’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/fords-sales-improving-but-still-down-by-27point4percent-in-the-third-quarter.html"&gt;dropped about 27 percent&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla, meanwhile, increased its global deliveries to more than 241,000 in the quarter, continuing the automaker’s steady growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1SRk47"&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-1zGhU");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-1zGhU");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LlJaq"&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk"&gt;sourcing different chips and rewriting software on the fly&lt;/a&gt; to make them work, Tesla was able to avoid the same kinds of major headaches caused by the shortage. But its success in 2021 is also thanks to increased popularity of the Model Y SUV — which it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/"&gt;just started selling in Europe&lt;/a&gt; and the UK — as well as a growing global presence. The company’s factory in China has been pumping out vehicles for more than a year now, and it has two more scheduled to come online in the near future in Texas and Germany. In fact, Tesla said Wednesday that it is already making some pre-production vehicles at the Austin, Texas factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOtNIt"&gt;“A variety of challenges, including semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts, have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed. We believe our supply chain, engineering and production teams have been dealing with these global challenges with ingenuity, agility and flexibility that is unparalleled in the automotive industry,” the company wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVOhlh"&gt;It wasn’t just a financially good quarter for Tesla, it was also a very busy one. In August, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened a probe into the company’s Autopilot driver assistance system and its tendency to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;crash into parked emergency vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, and two senators followed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;by asking the FTC to also investigate&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653205/tesla-roadster-elon-musk-ship-delay-2023"&gt;next-gen Roadster&lt;/a&gt; were both delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs6GP1"&gt;Tesla also held an “AI Day” event where CEO Elon Musk detailed its artificial intelligence efforts and announced the company is starting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22633514/tesla-robot-prototype-elon-musk-humanoid-ai-day"&gt;work on humanoid robots&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla said Wednesday that AI Day served its purpose as a recruiting event because it sparked an “overwhelming number of applications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y62Gak"&gt;In September, the new head of the National Transportation Safety Board said she wanted Tesla to address “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;basic safety issues&lt;/a&gt;” with its “Full Self-Driving” beta software before releasing it to more owners. Tesla went ahead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;released it anyway&lt;/a&gt; — though it created a so-called “Safety Score” evaluation process that only allows drivers who drive a certain way to access the beta software. Tesla made owners sign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; that discouraged them from sharing footage of the software performing poorly. But then Musk, speaking at Recode’s annual Code Conference, said owners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699361/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-nda-footage"&gt;weren’t following those instructions and backed off the practice&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeWtHw"&gt;And just after the quarter ended, Musk announced that he was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715458/tesla-move-headquarters-to-austin-texas"&gt;moving Tesla’s headquarters to Austin, Texas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvnzz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
