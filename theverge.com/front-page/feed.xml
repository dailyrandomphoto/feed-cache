      &lt;img alt="Apple iMac (2021)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGvEQd8G6B2pQnPI9JeMgCqAQSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69218028/appleimac2021hero2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvskRD"&gt;We’ve reached the weekend, and the start of another month. Sayonara, April, and hello to May. The past few days at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been some of the best tech deals so far this year, like the now-expired deal that knocked $150 off the Apple Watch Series 6, putting it lower in price than even the Apple Watch SE. That one sold out in just a few hours, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see it come again soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkJFs3"&gt;Not all of the best sales of the week have ended. You can save on PC games in celebration of Golden Week in Japan, and get $80 off a Google Nest Wifi bundle, to name a couple of examples. Find even more below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VFw4lY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qEG4do"&gt;Save up to $147 on a preorder of a new M1 iPad Pro or iMac&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QP5Tpi"&gt;Apple announced that the new iPad Pro and the colorful iMacs will begin shipping on May 21st. You can preorder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22409463/apple-m1-imac-ipad-pro-apple-tv-4k-preorders-price-release-date"&gt;all of those here&lt;/a&gt;. But you’d like to save some money on preordering, right? The site Expercom is hosting exclusive deals, knocking as much as $147 off preorders of the new 11-inch iPad Pro or iMac. These might not last for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VZ0s4I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474631"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="aGiMyZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10474637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="jdM9nn"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3zMi8Y"&gt;Save $80 on a Google Nest Wifi bundle through Saturday, May 1st&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PCzbhy"&gt;For the rest of Saturday, May 1st, Adorama is hosting a great deal on Google’s Nest Wifi router and a Point extender. You can get it for $189, which is $80 less than the bundle usually costs. Just enter the offer code &lt;strong&gt;EXTRAOFF80 &lt;/strong&gt;at the checkout page to save. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXoyYL"&gt;With these two mesh Wi-Fi devices running in tandem, you should be able to blanket your apartment or home in reliable wireless coverage. Outside of a sale, the router usually costs $169 itself, with the Point costing another $149, so you’re saving a considerable amount of cash. This deal will end Saturday, May 1st, at 11:59PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2K6oVM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Platinum Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vN6Xk8"&gt;Get PC games on sale in celebration of Golden Week&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qjgbMW"&gt;If you aren’t busy enough plowing through your backlog and want some new games on Steam, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/goldenweek"&gt;check out the store’s Golden Week sale&lt;/a&gt;, lasting through May 6th at 1PM ET. There are too many games on sale to list here, but a few of the standouts include &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; for $24 (usually $60), &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt; for $14 (usually $20), several games in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza &lt;/em&gt;franchises, &lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt; for $20 (usually $40), and much more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="M7PXNX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5DEK7"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are back down to $278&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bFT9nS"&gt;Sony’s excellent flagship wireless headphones are easy to recommend because of their great sound quality, effective noise cancellation, long-lasting battery life, and comfort. I personally think those features are worth paying the full asking price ($349) for. But, the whole reason why I’m mentioning them in this newsletter is because they’re $72 cheaper than usual at a few retailers — likely for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5Omoq3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ObMXqY"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HwfMbr"&gt;This Switch Pro controller includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Oi4Gt"&gt;At Walmart, you can snag the best controller available for the Switch, Nintendo’s Switch Pro, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-with-Super-Mario-Odyssey-Full-Game-Download-Code%2F925436036&amp;amp;subid1=TheVergeDeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $100&lt;/a&gt;. As for why it’s that price instead of its regular $69, well, it comes with a digital download of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; for the Switch, a $60 value on its own. So, this deal is like paying just $50 for each of them, saving $30 on the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6nfQ9i"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10057685"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new prime lenses are the small saviors I’ve been looking for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7xAVBtFM6C9CuNhytSsU7lze4s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217934/BFARSACE_042221_4548_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sony’s newest lenses are three new compact primes lenses that each cost $600.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItS4cR"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are three new compact prime lenses that each cost $599.99 and will be shipping in mid-May. While they uphold the reputation of quality Sony has established with the G Master lineup, it’s their uniformity and small size that come as a welcomed surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExaDUW"&gt;Uniformity and size are so rarely a topic of discussion in regards to lenses. As a video-first creator, 67mm, 77mm, and 82mm are common thread sizes in my gear bag. But it feels like with every new lens I buy I have to factor in the cost of a new ND filter or a step-up or down ring. These three new lenses all conveniently share the same 49mm filter thread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFPPDj"&gt;Then there is weight and size. It’s no secret that bags with full-frame camera gear are heavy, and lenses play no small role in that. Sony’s G Master lens lineup is notoriously guilty of being a line of large, heavy lenses with a very premium price tag. But this new trio of lenses are small and light enough to fit in a compact bag or even your jacket pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9epSVmSbsILKVxT_t8TZJudL9uA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476009/BFARSACE_042221_4548_07.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All three of the new Sony prime FE lenses are the same height and width.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGfhMB"&gt;Each of these lenses features an aperture click toggle, an autofocus toggle, a programmable button, and an aperture and focus ring. They are all weather-sealed and are 2.5 inches (64mm) in diameter while only 1.8 inches (45mm) tall. This uniformity is especially helpful when balancing a camera on a gimbal, where often the gimbal will need to be rebalanced with each lens swap. I was able to balance my A7C on a Zhiyun Crane M2 with the 24mm attached then easily change to the 50mm for tighter shots without having to rebalance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-gFLuY-fXKd-OvaHuBdZvcjZa2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476011/BFARSACE_042221_4548_09.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is an aperture click switch on the right-hand side of each lens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y05OuLG00GXwA83tQAA7Hc4YmXQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476012/BFARSACE_042221_4548_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each lens has a focus switch on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qz37Cj"&gt;The weight also plays an important role here. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crane-M2-Stabilizer-Mirrorless-Smartphone/dp/B07VHCT873?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zhiyun Crane M2&lt;/a&gt; is a $200 handheld gimbal designed for phones, action cameras, and point-and-shoot cameras. The 24mm f/2.8 weighs 162g (5.71oz), the 40mm f/2.5 is 173g (6.10oz), and the 50mm f/2.5 is 174g (6.13oz). Add the 50mm, the heaviest of the three lenses, to the 509g A7C, and at 683g, I was still under the Crane M2’s 720g (1.58lb) weight limit. That left me enough headroom to put my Rode VideoMicro mic on the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZKTHzW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony A7C Review: small camera, big sensor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21497207/sony-a7c-review-camera-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="csFXso"&gt;A full-frame camera with a G Master lens on a gimbal that small is truly remarkable, and my arms are forever grateful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tvF81J1rbiEyx7P5AJpwPcb2Yg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476017/BFARSACE_042221_4548_15.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zhiyun Crane M2 is rated for cameras up to 720g (1.58lb).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5PEaH_hKZ96g_HFY5B4Y1RqVds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476016/BFARSACE_042221_4548_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to mount a shotgun mic onto my camera without going over the gimbal’s weight limit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8kpRXA"&gt;Because there are typically fewer lens elements in a prime lens than a zoom lens, they are often sharper and have less &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fphotography%2Fdiscover%2Fchromatic-aberration.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22407694%2Fsony-g-master-24-40-50-prime-lens-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chromatic aberration&lt;/a&gt;. Primes also usually have wider aperture that can let in more light or provide more creative control over the depth of field in an image. At f/2.8 and f/2.5 maximum apertures, none of these three lenses will win contests for the blurriest bokeh or the most light-gathering ability. But on a full-frame Sony camera, they provide enough separation between subjects and pleasingly blurry backgrounds. Overall, they all capture sharp images with a soft, painterly focus falloff. Although I didn’t have any other primes lenses within the $600 price range to compare them to, I was impressed with the sharpness throughout the aperture range and the lack of chromatic aberration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AzRGfF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10470992"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="7b95sf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 50mm f/2.5 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="5ENAfA"&gt;For a head-to-head comparison between these new Sony primes and other lenses within this price range, check out the great video &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Hdu7xIzSypk"&gt;Gerald Undone&lt;/a&gt; put together. It covers everything from chromatic aberration to minimum focusing distance with a decent amount of pixel peeping for the nitpick-y among us. While I agree that the bokeh from the Sony primes shows a bit too much of their blades at higher apertures, I don’t find the chromatic aberration on the Sony 40mm and 50mm to be noticeable enough in real-world shots to be a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zZ5GDA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10471003"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="mYg3eo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 40mm f/2.5 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="6vuABY"&gt;During my time with these three lenses, I shot with the 24mm the most. When shooting in RAW, this 24mm has just the right amount of warp at the edges that both gives power to the subject and brings the viewer’s eye to the center of the frame. This is exactly the effect I am looking for from a wide-angle lens, but for folks who prefer a more linear image this may be off-putting. It is a great lens for selfies and architecture. I could also see myself using this lens for vlogging, when I need to capture both me and my environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gp6Fic"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10471028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h5 id="SIgXWD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos taken with the Sony 24mm f/2.8 G&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p id="3P4UED"&gt;The 40mm’s and 50mm’s focus falloff is even and quite stunning. When opened up to f/2.5, the maximum aperture, the background is blurred to the point of gooeyness. And while the 40mm can handle portraits, it’s also just wide enough to work for certain landscape shots, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C7PVkE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10470984"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIMMmE"&gt;Each lens has dual linear motors for fast and quiet autofocus, which is perfect for shooting video. There is a bit of focusing breathing, but it’s not regular enough to be a problem. I wish the minimum focus distance was a bit closer, though, especially on the 24mm where the nearest it can focus is 9.4 inches (24cm). The $550 Sigma 24mm f/3.5 has a 4.25-inch (10.8cm) minimum focus distance, and when taking photos of flowers, for example, this close focus can bring a viewer into the flower, a place we rarely are. It’s hard to pull that shot off with the Sony lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYkmNwbqTjL1NzKskp6DCSBYQR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476013/BFARSACE_042221_4548_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I was able to pack my Sony A7C, with one of the three lenses attached, and the two remaining primes all into my fanny pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krXsYEHEEXHG8xpgKFVeT8E1ZOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476014/BFARSACE_042221_4548_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bag closed easily and had room to spare for hand sanitizer and my wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ru0x0"&gt;Although these primes are far from the least expensive in their category, what made me love shooting with them is their uniform size without compromising controls available at the click of a button, quality, or weather seal. I can switch between them without having to rebalance my gimbal or really even adjust to different controls — they all feel the same on the front of my camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZJNfH"&gt;Sony finally has given me an experience I have yet to have with a G Master lens: portability. Taking three prime lenses on a walk is something I never do because a single zoom lens saves space and weight. But with these three lenses, I was able to carry a single fanny pack and not feel burdened by the weight of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAaU6a"&gt;On the video front, I welcome three lenses that all share the same filter thread so I don’t have to deal with multiple sets of step-up or down rings for my ND filters. I also appreciate the near silent autofocus and ability to toggle the aperture ring’s click on and off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sLq1Yluk7ecB0fwOcZMF8xXGaYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476004/BFARSACE_042221_4548_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When taking this photo, my Sony A7C’s autofocus system recognized these lenses as a face.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8xYxIm9Ife8w0UJAancH7bwUtI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476007/BFARSACE_042221_4548_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 40mm and 50mm lens hoods have filter threads on both the lens and the lens hood for easy mounting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8y8oDQh9l_IsZLwVzcEMrmNUM74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22476015/BFARSACE_042221_4548_13.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When paired with the Sony A7C, these lenses make for a compact package.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9XEuNc"&gt;The new Sony 24mm f/2.8, 40mm f/2.5, and 50mm f/2.5 are all compact without compromise and at a price that’s high but not out of reach. You can get faster lenses, you can get less expensive lenses, and you can get even smaller lenses. But you will be hard-pressed to find this combination of portability and performance in anything else in Sony’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s app store changes crank up the Apple pressure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UltTp-k1aCq4k4mOzZ3XxyzyMM8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69217712/VRG_ILLO_4030_Windows_10_Guide_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8jumvR"&gt;Microsoft shook up the PC gaming industry this week with the announcement that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409285/microsoft-store-cut-windows-pc-games-12-percent"&gt;cutting the fee it takes from game sales on the Windows store&lt;/a&gt;. On the surface, it’s a welcome move, with Microsoft matching the 12 percent cut that Epic Games takes, and putting more pressure on Valve, which still takes a 30 percent cut on most Steam purchases. But the cut is also a tactical move: Microsoft wants to help pressure Apple, and this week’s changes could play a role in the bigger app store battles kicking off next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKtdxU"&gt;Microsoft’s announcement comes just days before a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;huge court trial between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt;, and just as the EU has found issues with Apple’s rules — claiming the company has a “dominant position in the market for the distribution of music streaming apps through its App Store.” Microsoft has been quietly backing Epic Games’ action against Apple, and not-so-quietly calling for regulators to investigate the App Store. If either effort is successful, it would directly benefit Microsoft’s software business, as well as its ambitions for cloud gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lxhHs1"&gt;Epic founder Tim Sweeney has a long history with Microsoft, and it’s only recently that their interests have aligned. Sweeney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/4/11160104/tim-sweeney-microsoft-walled-garden-criticism"&gt;famously lashed out&lt;/a&gt; at Microsoft’s efforts to control the Windows software ecosystem with its store and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) initiative. Microsoft has since walked much of this back, and the company’s more open model for HoloLens saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18238508/microsoft-hololens-2-open-principles-tim-sweeney-interview"&gt;Sweeney share the stage&lt;/a&gt; with the software maker and pledge Epic Games’ support for Microsoft’s mixed reality headsets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3jYvZ2jqID-fj1HrB3x9QhHWu3Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14501150/vpavic_190224_Tim_Sweeney_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oA28no"&gt;Apple’s App Store, which is at the center of the current lawsuit, has also been a particular sore point for Microsoft. After losing out to iOS and Android with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/9/16446280/microsoft-finally-admits-windows-phone-is-dead"&gt;Windows Phone efforts&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has been fighting its own battles against Apple’s App Store for years. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507682/microsoft-apple-app-store-policies-principles-list"&gt;hitting out at the App Store&lt;/a&gt; with its own Windows store policy changes last year, Microsoft will take any chance it can to help force favorable fees, especially if it’s well timed. The software maker attempted to launch its SkyDrive (now OneDrive) app for iPhones back in 2012, but got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/11/3753968/microsoft-apple-skydrive-discussions-ios-app-rumor"&gt;locked in a battle&lt;/a&gt; with Apple over a 30 percent cut of revenue for cloud storage purchases in the app. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/11/3755942/office-mobile-iphone-ipad-microsoft-apple-in-app-sales-cut-rumor"&gt;was a test&lt;/a&gt; for Microsoft’s real cash cow — Office on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipVWMv"&gt;Microsoft has also been battling to launch its xCloud game streaming service on iOS, where it would love to keep the 30 percent cut it makes on game purchases and in-app transactions on cloud versions of Xbox games. Apple is still blocking services like xCloud or Stadia, and Microsoft has had to create a web version to work around the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ifRwj"&gt;While Microsoft hasn’t lodged any formal complaints about Apple, the company’s chief legal officer, Brad Smith, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theinformation.com%2Farticles%2Fmicrosoft-president-met-with-house-antitrust-committee&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F1%2F22411686%2Fmicrosoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly met&lt;/a&gt; with the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee last year to brief the panel on concerns around the App Store and its fees. This was around the same time Apple had &lt;a href="https://www.analysisgroup.com/globalassets/insights/publishing/apples_app_store_and_other_digital_marketplaces_a_comparison_of_commission_rates.pdf"&gt;commissioned a study&lt;/a&gt; that argued its 30 percent cut was an industry standard. It’s hard to look at Microsoft’s PC gaming fee cut this week and not see it as a well-timed push that will help highlight the disparity between PC and mobile app stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAqXwi"&gt;Microsoft’s app store on Windows isn’t a huge revenue driver for the company, and it already had a &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4o4bH"&gt;15 percent cut on apps&lt;/a&gt; ahead of these PC game changes. Gaming is the most lucrative part of any app store, but a large number of game developers don’t currently publish their games on the Windows store. That makes Microsoft’s cut to 12 percent sensible business if it, or even Epic Games, wants to leverage the changes to argue for App Store overhauls elsewhere. It also helps advance Microsoft and Epic Games’ narrative that PCs and smartphones are general-purpose computing platforms with fairer app store models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRtJ8-ceGVFKfD2OG5ld53IrfgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457649/xcloudiphone.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox game streaming on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r3tHhQ"&gt;Microsoft also announced this fee change, which doesn’t start until August, without any solid promises about improving its ailing Windows store. It feels rushed, with no obvious benefit to consumers in ways that matter, like cheaper games or an overhauled store. The fee cut also doesn’t apply to Xbox console games, and the timing feels like it’s also designed to prepare for future questions over the Xbox 30 percent cut by positioning PC differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxcEbq"&gt;Microsoft has previously defended its 30 percent cut for Xbox digital game sales. “Game consoles are specialized devices optimized for a particular use,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/08/app-store-fairness-caf-interoperability-principles/"&gt;said Rima Alaily&lt;/a&gt;, deputy general counsel at Microsoft, last year. Alaily argues that the “business model for game consoles is very different to the ecosystem around PCs or phones,” because Microsoft subsidizes the hardware and consoles “are vastly outnumbered in the marketplace by PCs and phones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q1apw"&gt;But while Microsoft has been more protective of the 30 percent cut collected on the Xbox, Epic Games seems happy to leave it in place. An Epic Games executive revealed in a court deposition this week that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;company has never sought to negotiate&lt;/a&gt; with Microsoft to avoid using its commerce engine on Xbox. “We are a significant revenue generator for all three of those platforms [Xbox, PlayStation, Switch], probably in the top five, you know, revenue sources for them,” admits Joe Kreiner, Epic’s vice president of business development. “So they have a vested interest in promoting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. We receive significant store placement that we do not have to pay for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nIfKVP"&gt;The same court filing revealed that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407939/fortnite-biggest-platform-revenue-playstation-not-ios-iphone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s cash cow is PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, not iOS, so there’s little incentive for Epic Games to question platforms where it makes most of its money, and receives special marketing deals.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fiPcYHqYuiYGghaJp7UefswArUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481817/14br_consoles_1920x1080_wlogo_1920x1080_432974386.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt; generates the most cash on PlayStation, not iOS.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cdAvKE"&gt;As luck would have it, Microsoft’s curiously-timed PC store fee change was announced in the same week the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;EU accuses Apple of App Store antitrust violations&lt;/a&gt;. While Friday’s announcement from the European Commission is focused on music streaming apps on the App Store, the commission is also investigating additional, separate cases on ebooks and the App Store in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOdCJp"&gt;European commissioner Margrethe Vestager also revealed the commission is looking at Apple’s policies around games on the App Store. “We also take an interest in the gaming app market,” said Vestager, responding to a question about the money involved in gaming apps on the App Store. “That’s really early days when it comes to that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WB6woB"&gt;Next week’s case between Epic Games and Apple will kick off a battle for the future of the App Store that will last much longer than a season in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The battle lines have been drawn in multiple directions, and Microsoft is sitting on the sidelines patiently hoping the app store war goes the way it wants it to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that card grading companies are drowning in Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-ENTERTAINMENT-games-POKEMON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQWC0FPfnvAU3Nq8tw9KPD7BmDY=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69216090/1162010559.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="703a8P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9a9/pokemon-cards-psa-cgc-bgs-turnaround-times"&gt;A report from Vice&lt;/a&gt; has opened my eyes to just how big the Pokémon trading card collecting market is getting — apparently to the point where card rating companies have waitlists that range from six to ten months, with one company claiming it’s receiving over 500,000 cards to grade per week. The card graders, who rate trading cards’ conditions to determine how collectable (and therefore valuable) they are, are so swamped that people who want to get their Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or sports cards graded are also having to wait in line (or &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;pay out the nose&lt;/a&gt; to skip it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn1u75"&gt;One card rating company apparently needed employees so bad it offered $1,000 starting bonuses — and then &lt;em&gt;bumped them up to $2,500&lt;/em&gt;. Another company had to buy &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; warehouses to store all the cards it was getting in. Apparently, even the the most basic original Pokémon cards can fetch upwards of $40 now in excellent condition, and graded cards can be worth up to 20 times their value in perfect condition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPNmSN"&gt;Of course, we’ve also seen the boom affecting the market in other ways— &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370253/ebay-app-scan-pokemon-cards-sell-more-easily-listing"&gt;eBay is adding a feature&lt;/a&gt; to its app specifically to scan cards and pre-populate listings with info (though not the card’s condition), making it slightly faster to list them. The &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;report also mentions that plastic card protectors have been completely selling out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="18SfHG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Maybe the pandemic has awoken people’s inner magpies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IGY6rT"&gt;Most of these effects seem linked to older Pokémon cards, as they’re the ones that are scarce — as the author of the &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; article points out, people are looking to see if they’ve got any that escaped the ravages of being childhood playthings after seeing &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/pokemon-card-opening-day-celebration-video-logan-paul-elite-box-2021-2"&gt;collectors like Logan Paul&lt;/a&gt; buying original cards or packs for obscenely high prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDM8Wp"&gt;But it also seems like some of the OG Pokémon shine has started to affect the market for new collectibles with unproven value, too: some Target stores have &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7kv9dd/target-is-prepared-to-call-the-cops-on-frantic-pokemon-card-hunters"&gt;threatened to call police&lt;/a&gt; on people camping outside for new Pokémon card restocks, and the Pokémon card company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;rushed to pump out&lt;/a&gt; as many new cards as it can.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hst3rp"&gt;Maybe the pandemic has awoken people’s inner magpies, turning on an insatiable desire to collect without really considering the value of what we’re buying (just look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, which feel like peak collectible). Of course, there are also those truly rare Pokémon cards that are quite valuable — but it can’t just be the rare cards hitting these card rating companies with, as one CEO put it, “an avalanche of cardboard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymD5nT"&gt;Honestly, seeing this news, on top of everything else, has left me with one burning question: where the &lt;em&gt;heck&lt;/em&gt; are people getting so much money that they can spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;$660K on a Mario cartridge&lt;/a&gt; or $300K on a Pokémon card? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This world-ending asteroid is the perfect vehicle for Pink Floyd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLa08Vvj4JPW01GZ66BiyJRnAzs=/111x0:860x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215894/Screen_Shot_2021_04_30_at_4.33.19_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFJuIO"&gt;If you’d like a visual of one way that doom could overtake Earth almost immediately, then YouTube user Anselo La Manna has just the video for you: &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU1QPtOZQZU"&gt;a large asteroid impact simulation scored to nothing other than Pink Floyd&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opzGUC"&gt;Specifically, that’s “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVBCE3gaNxc"&gt;Great Gig in the Sky&lt;/a&gt;,” off what might be the band’s most beloved and over-analyzed album, &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt;. It’s got everything total annihilation needs: contemplative piano, pedal steel guitar, and of course, a plaintive wail, capturing the whole range of emotions that people might feel if they were burned to a crisp because one big rock hit another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrgVIK"&gt;Anselo La Manna also hosts &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PENT_hnyO-o"&gt;the original clip&lt;/a&gt; the mashup video uses on their YouTube page, a simulation of a large asteroid impact. It appears to be from &lt;em&gt;Miracle Planet&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary series that aired on the Discovery Channel. For comparison, our last brush with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398868/nasa-asteroid-election-day-2018vp1-danger-hit-chance"&gt;a potential asteroid-based death in 2020&lt;/a&gt; was neither deadly nor exceptionally exciting. The asteroid missed us, and was only about the size of a smart car in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqGkq9"&gt;You could quibble that this video isn’t synced perfectly (the vocals could come in right on impact), or that it might not compare to playing &lt;em&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;em&gt;Wizard of Oz. &lt;/em&gt;But it captures the timeless quality of the end of the world perfectly, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdscyo"&gt;We all dread it, but on a Friday, at least the weekend’s right around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jm3pP0H2AGDUna-zzyMBnX2tkD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22482710/Screen_Shot_2021_04_30_at_4.04.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suspiciously, Big Ben is somehow still standing in the aftermath of the asteroid’s impact. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Facebook acquires the developers of VR military simulator Onward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0_S_XLwQ_g7_WSofbyrC69bDIg=/101x0:1190x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215417/_joK6MdQ.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Onward&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Downpour Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OiAynm"&gt;Facebook’s Oculus division has snatched up yet another popular virtual reality game developer. On Friday, the company announced &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it has acquired Downpour Interactive&lt;/a&gt;, the studio behind the hit multiplayer military simulator &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbdHpD"&gt;“We’ve seen great success with &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; on the Oculus platform for several years — first on Rift and more recently on Quest,” Mike Verdu, Facebook’s VP of AR / VR content, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fwelcoming-downpour-interactive-to-facebook%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “Becoming part of the Oculus Studios family will give Downpour Interactive the opportunity to cultivate both the &lt;em&gt;Onward&lt;/em&gt; community with the full support of Oculus Studios resources, and, in the future, pursue other projects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Il5KQb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone from Downpour will move to Oculus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQPsS"&gt;Everyone from Downpour Interactive will move over to the Oculus Studios team “in some capacity,” Verdu said. He also confirmed that Onward will still be supported on all of the platforms where it’s currently available: the Oculus Rift, Oculus Quest, and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10Duxn"&gt;Dante Buckley, founder and CEO of Downpour Interactive, said in an &lt;a href="https://www.downpourinteractive.com/"&gt;FAQ on the studio’s website&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Onward’s&lt;/em&gt; feature roadmap “remains unchanged” and that the studio plans to “accelerate the speed of our development” because of the acquisition. Downpour Interactive will also continue to retain “full control of all development,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p65A6P"&gt;

    <title>NASA suspends SpaceX’s $2.9 billion moon lander contract after rivals protest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yubuqrvBWN08D_C6Xb-GjnmbNwk=/154x0:985x554/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69215254/for_press_release.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A digital illustration of SpaceX’s Starship lunar lander sitting on the Moon’s surface, as proposed to NASA under its Artemis program.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="67JSBP"&gt;NASA has suspended work on SpaceX’s new $2.9 billion lunar lander contract while a federal watchdog agency adjudicates two protests over the award, the agency said Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28bTex"&gt;Putting the Human Landing System (or HLS) work on hold until the GAO makes a decision on the two protests means SpaceX won’t immediately receive its first chunk of the $2.9 billion award, nor will it commence the initial talks with NASA that would normally take place at the onset of a major contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40B7Zs"&gt;Elon Musk’s SpaceX was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;picked&lt;/a&gt; by NASA on April 16th to build the agency’s first human lunar lander since the Apollo program, as the agency opted to rely on just one company for a high-profile contract that many in the space industry expected to go to two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HhY2M"&gt;As a result, two companies that were in the running for the contract, Blue Origin and Dynetics, protested NASA’s decision to the Government Accountability Office, which adjudicates bidding disputes. Blue Origin alleges the agency unfairly “moved the goalposts at the last minute” and endangered NASA’s speedy 2024 timeline by only picking SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sA6duQ"&gt;“Pursuant to the GAO protests, NASA instructed SpaceX that progress on the HLS contract has been suspended until GAO resolves all outstanding litigation related to this procurement,” NASA spokeswoman Monica Witt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pmwJHe"&gt;Starship, SpaceX’s fully reusable rocket system under development to eventually ferry humans and cargo to the Moon and Mars, won NASA’s award mainly for its massive cargo capability and its proposed bid of $2.9 billion — far cheaper than Blue Origin’s and Dynetics’, according to a NASA source selection document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gloui"&gt;Starship’s development to this point has been driven primarily by Musk, SpaceX’s billionaire founder and chief executive. The company has launched several Starship prototypes in short- and high-altitude test flights at its Boca Chica, Texas, launch facilities. Landing the prototypes after soaring over six miles in the air has proved to be a formidable challenge — all of SpaceX’s high-altitude prototype rockets have been destroyed in landing-phase explosions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlXjci"&gt;SpaceX’s private Starship development will likely continue. The company’s most recent test of a Starship prototype, SN15, is slated to launch within the next few days after clinching license approval from the Federal Aviation Administration this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEnUzS"&gt;NASA has said picking one company was the best decision it could make at the time with the funds made available from Congress. Last year, Congress gave the agency $850 million of the $3.3 billion it requested to procure two lunar landers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCwXjE"&gt;SpaceX’s award was a key “first step” in a broader program to secure transportation to the Moon, NASA’s human spaceflight chief Kathy Lueders said at the time, promising that new contract opportunities will open up in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMIzur"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMVks7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal COVID-19 vaccine website launches with Spanish-language version </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Healthcare Workers Administer Covid-19 Vaccines At American Museum of Natural History" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiXWAKoiaPO3IL8k6vtflQOk2Ms=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214991/1232612380.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EFi9VB"&gt;The Biden administration’s version of a COVID-19 vaccine-finding website launched today, along with a Spanish-language version, text messaging tool, and phone hotline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TaBS0"&gt;The new website, &lt;a href="http://vaccines.gov"&gt;vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt;, is a new version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337754/covid-vaccine-availability-website-vaccinefinder-biden"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, a site run through a partnership between Boston Children’s Hospital and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. VaccineFinder was originally created during the 2009 swine flu outbreaks and has hosted COVID-19 vaccine information for the past few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx4g6w"&gt;The new version has the same features as the old site. It lets people locate sites offering COVID-19 vaccines nearby, shows which vaccines are on offer at each location, and says if the vaccines are in stock or not. “In stock” does not necessarily mean there are appointments available, just that the site has shots on hand. People cannot make appointments directly through &lt;a href="http://Vaccines.gov"&gt;vaccines.gov&lt;/a&gt; — the website directs them to the vaccination site’s registration system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0jmR7"&gt;There is now also a Spanish-language version of the site, found at &lt;a href="https://www.vacunas.gov/"&gt;vacunas.gov&lt;/a&gt;. There are few COVID-19 vaccination resources available for people in the US who do not speak English. Limited access to non-English vaccine information is the subject of a new federal civil rights complaint filed by the National Health Law Program. In 11 states, health departments have no non-English information available on their websites, a &lt;em&gt;Type Investigations&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.typeinvestigations.org/investigation/2021/04/30/covid-language-access-lep/"&gt;report found&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgnfMu"&gt;Along with the website, the Biden administration is launching a text messaging tool and phone line to connect people with vaccination sites. The phone line will be promoted in rural areas without reliable internet, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/biden-team-launches-website-text-messages-to-locate-vaccines"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Older adults and other groups not comfortable using the internet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;struggled&lt;/a&gt; to sign up for vaccination appointments early on in the US vaccine campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkOWTk"&gt;The rate of COVID-19 vaccinations in the US is starting to slow now that most people who were eager to get vaccinated have already received shots. The next step is reaching people who aren’t going to actively seek out a shot, or who may have questions about it. Over 100 million people in the US are &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;fully vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;, as of April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro? You may have to wait until July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhrRuUTDaqBkWS4_drkuoi_XzPU=/312x0:2000x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214967/lcimg_06ebca85_7eac_4c32_9e8f_4b98fad99ec8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g58tOJ"&gt;If you’re hoping to get one of the new 12.9-inch iPad Pros with a Mini LED display, you may be waiting a while — the delivery times for even &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F12.9-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the base model&lt;/a&gt; have slipped to late June or early July (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-30/apple-s-new-high-end-ipad-pros-see-delivery-times-slip-to-july"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Leading up to the device’s announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-facing-supply-shortage-of-upcoming-high-end-ipad-display?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;there were rumors&lt;/a&gt; that the display tech could be a production bottleneck for Apple, and that appears to be the case — Apple’s site says &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1043492/7613?sharedid=VergeNew12.9iPadPro043021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-ipad%2Fipad-pro%2F11-inch-display-128gb-space-gray-wifi"&gt;the 11-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;, announced alongside the 12.9-inch, would be delivered in late May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOuBkf"&gt;The Mini LED display that could be to blame for the short supply of iPads is a new tech for Apple, but it promises to bring a ton of improvements compared to normal LED displays. However, they’re trickier to produce — Apple says that the previous iPad Pro’s display had 72 LEDs, while the Mini LED version boasts over 10,000. For a more in-depth look at the tech, we have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;an explainer here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acing its fourth flight on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity will advance to a new testing round  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8kkmAKCo0ltSFbiLlM2m4XeOen0=/0x4:1580x1057/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69214965/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0068_0672974790_421ECM_N0032208ZCAM05029_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ingenuity helicopter on Mars.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0M0CfP"&gt;After acing a set of historic test flights on Mars, NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter will embark on a new, more advanced test mission, engineers said today. Having proved itself capable of flying higher and farther with its fourth flight on Friday, the mini helicopter will get ready to demonstrate how it could help Mars rovers, like Perseverance, scout for new locations and probe areas inaccessible to wheeled robots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbWMG4"&gt;Ingenuity, which became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;the first helicopter to fly on another world&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, was initially set to retire forever when its flight demonstration phase ends next week, after completing five flights. But the team at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory okayed another round of testing because Perseverance’s post-landing health checks are ahead of schedule — and Ingenuity isn’t ready to put its twin carbon fiber rotor blades to rest yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhk4Fk"&gt;For the first (and current) test phase, the four-pound helicopter proved it’s possible to achieve powered lift in the thin Martian atmosphere, opening up a new mode of transportation for planetary exploration. The next test phase will be slightly different, and more ambitious, than the first: Ingenuity will observe specific science targets on Mars, scout for interesting locations for Perseverance, and look for new potential flight zones for future flights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hPbN1"&gt;“The lessons learned from that exercise will benefit future missions with aerial platforms tremendously,” said MiMi Aung, the helicopter’s project manager, adding that the craft’s test capabilities will be pushed with each flight. This phase will only contain one or two flights, spaced further apart. But engineers signaled more could be planned depending on the helicopter’s performance. And Perseverance, acting as Ingenuity’s comms mothership from a distance of a few hundred feet, won’t use its onboard cameras to take photos of the helicopter, as it’s doing for the first phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYbptM"&gt;Since deploying from the belly of Perseverance on April 4th, Ingenuity has nailed four flight tests so far, each with increasing complexity: The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;first flight&lt;/a&gt; was a 40-second hover 10 feet above the ground, and its third flight rose 16 feet, then zipped 164 feet across its flight zone at about 4.5 miles per hour. Ingenuity made its fourth flight on Friday, and engineers are currently analyzing troves of data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-mKNJOs4R5wRsUWZwzkZpPGVB2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22481995/E0PeQ51VIAE_QX2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An initial image taken by Perseverance’s Hazcam shows Ingenuity, appearing as a small speck in the upper-middle-right part of the frame, flying its fourth flight test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m3eEOz"&gt;Perseverance landed on Mars with Ingenuity on February 18th. The rover’s primary mission is to hunt for signs of fossilized life and pack soil samples into cigar-sized tubes to leave scattered around the Martian surface. A future “fetch” rover will retrieve those tubes sometime in the next decade or so. The recent decision to collect those soil samples near Ingenuity’s flight zone helped NASA make the call to keep Ingenuity in service — suddenly, having Perseverance stick around to keep tabs on the helicopter’s health became possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5WLx8"&gt;Ingenuity’s fourth test flight demonstrated farther and faster travel, and served as a scout mission for the flight zone it’ll use for its next testing phase. Its fifth flight, scheduled to take place in the coming days, will be a one-way trip to that new location. &lt;/p&gt;
