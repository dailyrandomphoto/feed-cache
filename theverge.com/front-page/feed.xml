    <title>EV startup Canoo loses chief technology officer and two co-founders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvOMzD8OEGVso3glXXgaDeGTdwI=/158x0:1882x1149/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298345/Canoo_MPDV_Family.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I8vfHd"&gt;EV startup Canoo is losing three top executives, including its chief technology officer Peter Savagian, as part of an apparent shakeup of its leadership team. Savagian, the former chief engineer of General Motors EV1 electric car, will leave Canoo by the end of the year, according to the &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/76/canoo-expands-executive-team-to-execute-business-and"&gt;last line of a press release published Monday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuv8Sl"&gt;The two others are some of Canoo’s remaining co-founders, two current employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on the condition of anonymity, though they weren’t named in the press release: Bill Strickland, the head of Canoo’s vehicle programs and a longtime Ford executive, and Alexi Charbonneau, who worked at both SpaceX and Tesla and oversaw Canoo’s powertrain division. Strickland and Charbonneau did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment. Canoo did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCCgb2"&gt;Three of the original founding group remain. Sohel Merchant will replace Savagian as CTO. Richard Kim, Canoo’s chief designer, is now also going to be in charge of creative content and, on an interim basis, merchandising. The third, Christoph Kuttner, remains in charge of the interior and exterior trim of Canoo’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QvL0KO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Three of Canoo’s nine co-founders remain&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m8jEoM"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 when former BMW executive Stefan Krause left then-struggling EV startup Faraday Future. Krause and some of the other executives who co-founded Canoo — which was then called Evelozcity — were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947846/faraday-future-lawsuit-trade-secrets-stefan-krause-evelozcity"&gt;sued by Faraday Future for poaching employees and allegedly stealing trade secrets&lt;/a&gt;, though the lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sokane1/status/1072966577660854272"&gt;settled in late 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1vGav"&gt;Krause &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;left Canoo in June 2020&lt;/a&gt; before it merged with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) and became listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. (The details of Canoo’s SPAC merger are currently being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;.) Krause’s replacement — fellow Canoo co-founder and former BMW executive Ulrich Kranz — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;resigned this past April&lt;/a&gt; and took a job with Apple working on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;secretive electric autonomous car project&lt;/a&gt;. Original powertrain lead and co-founder Phil Weicker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;left in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvpBY2"&gt;Canoo’s chief lawyer left at the same time as Kranz, too, though he wasn’t a co-founder. Its &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000155837021003592/tmb-20210323x8k.htm"&gt;chief financial officer Paul Balciunas resigned in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxIHUB"&gt;The startup announced Monday that it hired a new chief information officer, Ram Balasubramanian, who has “held senior technology management positions for more than two decades at such companies as Salesforce.com, Motorola Solutions and PepsiCo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9D96L"&gt;Canoo’s priorities have been shifting along with the makeup of its leadership team ever since investor Tony Aquila &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;took over as executive chairman in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, just after the startup went public. (Aquila also took on the CEO role after Kranz resigned.) Since then, Aquila has reoriented the startup towards making commercial electric vehicles mean to be sold to small businesses and fleets. He scuppered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;deal with Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. He shifted Canoo’s headquarters from Torrance, California, to Bentonville, Arkansas, and announced a manufacturing facility in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783974/canoo-moves-to-walmart-hometown"&gt;startup’s new home state&lt;/a&gt; (after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538811/canoo-ev-factory-oklahoma-electric-vehicles-vdl-nedcar"&gt;announcing another one in Oklahoma&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Liot5V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6U7JXO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The QuietOn 3 earbuds use ANC to help you sleep</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQ8yw8eZ8gbhopA4ToGLLgNz3gc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70298318/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q871O3"&gt;I’ve always been a light sleeper, and that has not improved over the last few years. So I thought I was the perfect person to try out the latest version of the QuietOn active noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rULbA7"&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds, which cost $239, are the third iteration of these devices. They are smaller than the previous version, the QuietOn 2, but the basic functionality is the same. Unlike other “help to sleep” earbuds such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, they don’t generate white noise, or play quiet music, or let you hear rain or other soothing sounds. The idea is simply to eliminate low-frequency noises, such as the hum of a nearby appliance, that may keep you from sleeping while allowing you to still hear an alarm clock going off. &lt;a href="https://quieton.com/technology/"&gt;According to the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the buds are equipped with active noise-canceling technology that uses a microphone to sample the sound and a speaker to create a phase-shifted sound that cancels the original sound. It’s not unlike the noise cancellation systems in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;many popular earbuds available today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The QuietOn 3 earbuds are very small — small enough to wear comfortably at night." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qH8r9A6pojir6qOZlKXQ8bsdqZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115430/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietOn 3 earbuds are very small — small enough to wear comfortably at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NLvcGd"&gt;How effective are they? That depends very much on what kind of sleeper you are. I tried the QuietOn 3 buds for several nights and found my success rate — mixed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsh7WO"&gt;The buds are indeed small and lightweight. They come with four sizes of foam eartips: XS, S, M, and L; you are supposed to compress the foam tips and then place them in your ears and allow the foam to expand to create a seal. Meanwhile, the electronic section of the buds fits neatly into the bottom curve of your ear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuLC0w"&gt;I started with the small eartips, but when I still heard sound getting through, I went on to the medium to try to get a better seal. Be prepared to spend some time adjusting these to find the best fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYmw0e"&gt;My first issue was figuring out which earbud goes into which ear. There is a small “L” and “R” etched into the inner surface of the buds, but they are difficult — make that nearly impossible — to see (I had trouble even with my reading glasses on). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GQOJrgHaTzfke_4X4LGWMzfTpx8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115434/bkrasnoff_211216_4936_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s nearly impossible to see the embossed label that tells you whether a bud is for the right or left ear. (Hint: it’s just above the gray eartip.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp03zx"&gt;But even if I was reasonably certain I had the buds in properly, I had trouble figuring out whether they were working. According to the instructions, you can test them by putting the top of the case next to each bud (while it’s in your ear) and moving it slowly away until you hear a click. The problem is that I sometimes thought I may have heard the click, but it was so quiet that I wasn’t quite sure. So finally, I just assumed they were active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeF1Ae"&gt;I will say that the small buds were quite comfortable enough to wear. I’m a side-sleeper and could easily ignore them even when my ear was pressing into the pillow. That’s not something you can easily do with a lot of standard earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5iVZV"&gt;The charging case is also relatively small. Two sets of three LEDs in front let you know whether the buds are powered up (three lit LEDs for fully charged, two for reasonably charged, and if you see a single flashing LED, it’s time to recharge via a USB-C connection). Another set of three LEDs in the back, right above the USB-C jack, tells you whether the case itself is powered. The buds typically lasted two nights without needing to be recharged and might easily have lasted three (although it was easy enough to simply slip them into their case each morning for a power-up). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LEDs at the back of the case let you know whether it needs recharging." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HWLvJpFtWL6XehraNDlkL6WgCro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23115433/bkrasnoff_211202_4936_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LEDs at the back of the case let you know whether it needs recharging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KUp7bA"&gt;So, how effective are they? I think that can be a very individual thing. They did suppress somewhat the lower-frequency sounds around me, such as street noise and my partner’s occasional snoring. They were also pretty good at protecting me when my neighbor’s baby complained in the middle of the night. According to the website, they are most effective in shielding you from such noises as a recycling refrigerator in the next room or an air-conditioner. But unfortunately, because I’m such a light sleeper, that wasn’t quite enough to really help me stay asleep. Distant sirens, a squirrel scrabbling on my roof, or a truck rumbling past — these all got past the buds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTJkuR"&gt;They were actually much more useful when I was trying to concentrate while working. In that case, I could still hear my keyboard and somebody calling me from the other room, but street sounds, the noises from next door, and the hum of a computer fan were dulled enough to let me concentrate better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BtSnZI"&gt;So are the QuietOn 3 earbuds worth the cost? I think that depends on how well they work for you. For myself, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22176950/bose-sleepbuds-ii-earbuds-review"&gt;Bose Sleepbuds II&lt;/a&gt;, which cost only $10 more, were way more effective because they offered a wide selection of sounds that actually masked the noise around me. The QuietOn 3, which only cover a specific spectrum of sounds, are more suitable for calmer environments where you may be occasionally disturbed by a humming fridge or an occasional car going by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evNUrX"&gt;In short: while the box that the QuietOn 3 came in urges you to “Enjoy the Nordic quietude,” I’m afraid Nordic quietude is no match for New York City sirens.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brian Eno is not a fan of NFTs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="brian eno-shamil tanna-01" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FM-EZi2GPcZyJu9GmcJFxOWFVOs=/0x0:1400x933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297916/shamil_tanna_2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4B6v3"&gt;If you were saving up Ethereum for a set of &lt;em&gt;Discreet Music&lt;/em&gt; NFTs, we’ve got bad news. In &lt;a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Crypto Syllabus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (conducted by longtime tech critic &lt;a href="https://www.evgenymorozov.com/"&gt;Evgeny Morozov&lt;/a&gt;, of all people), Eno outed himself as a skeptic of cryptocurrency — and NFTs in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSan1x"&gt;“NFTs seem to me just a way for artists to get a little piece of the action from global capitalism, our own cute little version of financialization,” Eno told Morozov. “How sweet — now artists can become little capitalist assholes as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="yMARuX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yFY9xX"&gt;Best known for his pioneering ambient work and prolific producer credits, Eno seems like the perfect artist for the NFT era. He’s spent decades making art with an eye towards technology and its social implications, often made available as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/8/3475456/brian-eno-scape-ipad-app-ambient-music-creation"&gt;software&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/design/brian-eno-color-changing-turntable-sold-out"&gt;limited-edition product drops&lt;/a&gt;. Eno was a particularly early proponent of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music"&gt;algorithmically generated art&lt;/a&gt;, pioneering the same basic process that produced those endless minutely varied monkey portraits for the Bored Ape crew. It would be easy for him to bank a few million pounds by turning this generative iPad app, say, into a string of 10,000 numbered NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtqEBY"&gt;But as he describes it in the interview, taking the NFT turn would be pointless as an artistic move and craven as a financial calculation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64WPq0"&gt;“I am not sure what is being brought into the world that makes any difference to anything other than some strings of numbers moving about in some bank accounts,” Eno continues. “People I like and trust are convinced they’re the best thing since sliced bread, so I wish I could have a more positive view, but right now, I mainly see hustlers looking for suckers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kib6kA"&gt;Read the whole thing &lt;a href="https://the-crypto-syllabus.com/brian-eno-on-nfts-and-automatism/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans management firm accused of having employees talk to fans as influencers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JsyJ0jNY653dhhl5Gi2dnRAeDyY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297914/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jOsj1k"&gt;A prominent agency that manages accounts for OnlyFans creators has been accused of having its employees catfish fans by reading and replying to messages meant for creators. According to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/former-onlyfans-star-managers-say-they-catfished-fans-unruly-agency-2021-12?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fans who thought they were talking to models managed by Unruly Agency would confess fetishes, fantasies, and other private matters, but the person on the other end may have actually been an employee of the agency, not the intended recipient — one person who worked as an account manager said they were “basically a professional scammer.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eexsX8"&gt;According to the report, Unruly Agency handles accounts for several popular OnlyFans’ influencers. But, according to employees, in addition to helping them schedule photo shoots and manage posts, they also help models deal with the deluge of fans who want to talk to them (and who are often willing to pay for that privilege). This, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, leads to Unruly’s employees ghostwriting for models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="x3pPsi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Former employees say they heard about fans’ failing marriages and fetishes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEHtJV"&gt;Sometimes they’re seeing and responding to incredibly intimate messages — fans, who think they’re talking to someone who they’ve possibly seen naked, will talk about what turns them on or their failing marriages. Putting aside the very real questions about parasocial relationships on the platform that this kind of behavior brings up, fans send those messages believing that someone they think they know will read it and possibly respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8Sr3R"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, this type of deception is a grey area when it comes to OnlyFans’ terms of service — one lawyer said it was probably fine, another said it could depend on how a creator pitched their chat services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oWT98L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some creators have accused the company of posting nudes they didn’t want public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HSKqlB"&gt;Unruly is also facing allegations that it mistreated its employees, as well as the creators it managed. Multiple creators have alleged that the company or other affiliated agencies inappropriately &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/unruly-contracts-onlyfans-creators-workers"&gt;posted nude content of them&lt;/a&gt; — sometimes outside of their terms (posting it to their public feed, rather than to a more exclusive feed), and sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/onlyfans-model-sues-influencer-management-firm-unruly-agency-2021-8"&gt;without their permission or knowledge that the nude photos even existed&lt;/a&gt;. One &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lawsuit-accuses-unruly-agency-of-wage-theft-wrongful-termination-and-other-illegal-behavior-301422087.html"&gt;lawsuit brought by former employees&lt;/a&gt; accuses the company of wage theft and retaliatory firing (it also reiterates the claims that managers were told to lie about actually being the influencers fans thought they were talking to). You can &lt;a href="https://www.helmerfriedman.com/docs/Machabeli-v-UnrulyAgency.pdf"&gt;read the lawsuit here&lt;/a&gt; (PDF).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrKUkL"&gt;One creator &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/unruly-contracts-onlyfans-creators-workers"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that, when she raised concerns about terms in the contract she was signing, people from the company said the terms wouldn’t be enforced and that they were just in there because it was “what our lawyer makes us do.” When telling her story about trying to leave Behave Agency (which &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/unruly-agency-promises-online-fame-this-influencer-says-they-posted-her-nudes-and-threatened-her-instead"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; describes&lt;/a&gt; as “Unruly’s spinoff for smaller influencers”) and being hit with a $300,000 fee, she said, “They have such a big company, I just would have never imagined that they’d be so desperate to trap anybody.” That creator also said that Behave changed the banking details on her OnlyFans account, making so that the money went to the company instead of to her directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsHm8w"&gt;Unfortunately, there’s precedent for many of the elements of this story. The adult entertainment industry has &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/15/why-are-people-silent-about-the-abuses-and-exploitation-in-porn"&gt;a reputation for exploiting and abusing workers&lt;/a&gt;, and there’s a long history of online content creators feeling as if they’ve been &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/some-youtubers-are-overjoyed-that-maker-studios-is-firi-1792854530"&gt;treated unfairly by management platforms&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also seen accusations of corporate catfishing before — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/are-ashley-madisons-fake-profiles-legal-2013-11"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/08/25/ashley-madison-faked-female-profiles-to-lure-men-in-hacked-data-suggest/"&gt;analysis of hacked data&lt;/a&gt; from extramarital dating website Ashley Madison (whose slogan was “Life is short. Have an affair”) indicated that the company created fake profiles that would send messages to men.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch the first trailer for The Witcher: Blood Origin on Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06aCYr7uZD846m1bINz2TKbywr8=/0x1:4096x2732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297899/FG0JNfQWQAkXjfV.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UrHvvu"&gt;There’s more to &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; universe than just Geralt, and Netflix gave the first glimpse at that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mawzQRu1Kc4"&gt;with an early look at &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22692726/witcher-blood-origin-trailer-cast-netflix"&gt;initially revealed as a post-credits scene&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; season 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826460/witcher-season-2-review-netflix"&gt;which debuted on December 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2xH3H"&gt;The upcoming live-action prequel &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;stars Michelle Yeoh as a sword elf&lt;/a&gt;, and it takes place well before the main series, covering the events that led to the creation of witchers in the first place. Netflix describes the series as an “epic prequel series depicting the creation of the prototype witcher and the events leading to the pivotal ‘Conjunction of the Spheres.’” (For more on the conjunction, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839928/witcher-multiverse-physicist-explains"&gt;check out this interview&lt;/a&gt; on the scientific possibilities of the multiverse.) The show is slated to debut on Netflix sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9RiDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt; is just one part of an almost MCU-style universe that Netflix is trying to craft around &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;. The tentpole is the live-action series starring Henry Cavill, which just debuted its second season, but there are multiple spinoffs, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638162/the-witcher-nightmare-of-the-wolf-review-netflix"&gt;an anime prequel called &lt;em&gt;Nightmare of the Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNwruH"&gt;Meanwhile, 2022 is shaping up to be a great year for fans of Michelle Yeoh. In addition to wielding a sword in &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;, she’s also tackling a multiverse of her own in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834049/michelle-yeoh-everything-everywhere-all-at-once-trailer"&gt;the trippy-looking &lt;em&gt;Everything Everywhere All At Once&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which hits theaters next March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1OP7lPoF9NjIHj15Xk3XaYcX_0Y=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297871/1230436485.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mh8joz"&gt;There’s something extraordinarily frustrating about subscribing to a TV service only for that service to lose the programming you signed up for. But that threat of lost channels — or worse, the actual loss of major networks — is a recurring problem for internet TV services, and it comes up &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cFpe8"&gt;The latest incident hit just this weekend: late Friday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;more than a dozen&lt;/a&gt; Disney-owned channels, including ESPN and FX, disappeared from YouTube TV when the two companies failed to reach a deal to keep them on the streaming service. The dispute didn’t last long. Just 36-or-so hours later, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/19/22845373/youtube-tv-disney-espn-channel-fx-abc-restored"&gt;the companies came to an agreement&lt;/a&gt; — soon enough to avoid anyone missing ESPN’s Monday Night Football.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y250tf"&gt;It was an outcome Disney could pretty much bank on. “Great content always wins and has great leverage,” Keith Zubchevich, CEO of streaming data company Conviva, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Audiences want the best content, regardless of where they pay for it or watch it. It’s up to aggregators and big platforms to make sure they get the deal done, especially in streaming where consumer choice is even greater.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0iMSo"&gt;Seeing two companies publicly duke it out over contract negotiations like this has become commonplace. In July, Fubo TV lost &lt;a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/tv/2021/07/ae-history-lifetime-channels-dropped-by-fubotv-in-what-company-deems-a-cost-cutting-measure.html"&gt;several channels&lt;/a&gt; from A+E Networks, including History Channel, Lifetime, and A&amp;amp;E. Hulu with Live TV has lost &lt;a href="https://help.hulu.com/s/article/sinclair-rsn"&gt;support for some Fox regional sports channels&lt;/a&gt; last year, while Sling TV lost &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/great-now-sling-tv-and-dish-are-losing-masn-and-nbc-re-1846603206"&gt;NBC regional sports networks&lt;/a&gt; in April. YouTube TV has publicly sparred with Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702511/youtube-tv-nbcuniversal-extension-dispute-negotiation"&gt;NBCUniversal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22823949/roku-google-youtube-tv-deal-multiyear-extension"&gt;Roku&lt;/a&gt; in the past four months alone, reaching last-minute deals that allowed users to continue using their services or platforms as they had been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rjMPg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They essentially want the consumer to get mad.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zqWqGf"&gt;Each time, these negotiations broke out into public view, letting subscribers know their service’s channel selection may be on the line. So why play up the drama and send subscribers into a tizzy — or worse, have to issue rapid-fire news updates about dropped and subsequently restored service — when more often than not, a resolution is the most likely outcome?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oyWeAn"&gt;“They’re all playing to the same audience, which is the consumer. They essentially want the consumer to get mad,” Zubchevich says. “It’s all about a narrative in the public perspective that is essentially trying to maintain: how are viewers going to hold value in different brands?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kj4pU"&gt;In streaming, content is only as valuable as its ability to hang on to customers. So while Disney and YouTube TV were unable to reach a deal initially last week, YouTube TV clearly foresaw the impact the loss of those channels could have on its business. Disney is the parent of ESPN, and YouTube TV was positioned to lose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22836949/disney-youtube-tv-channels-deal"&gt;five ESPN properties&lt;/a&gt; should the two parties have failed to reach an agreement. With Monday Night Football in full swing, the impact on YouTube TV’s business would have almost certainly been brutal. So it’s no shock that YouTube TV worked diligently to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o84I1Q"&gt;“Sports has always been a genre of entertainment, much like movies, that drives engagement, drives subscribership, that drives viewership,” Paul Erickson, a senior analyst with Parks Associates, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The collective sports content community understands the value of what they’re offering. They can drive engagement and subscribership arguably like no other genre in any video. So they know that their content is of value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ryHGIE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1IrzTn"&gt;These disputes are part of the growing pains that come with making content deals in such a new space. Zubchevich says networks don’t want to make long-lasting deals because it’s hard to estimate what their content will be worth even a couple years out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA1mvc"&gt;“Carriage deals are so short because viewing is growing so rapidly, it’s nearly impossible to quantify a multi-year deal or predict what viewing will look like on a longer timeframe,” Zubchevich says. “And it’s so last minute because they’re trying to determine whether content or eyeballs are king — waiting to see who will blink first as it plays out in public view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1SP8BY"&gt;Plus, new ad formats and distribution options make streaming-era negotiations for content even more complex, Anjali Midha, co-founder and CEO of analytics company Diesel Labs, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ3Kt2"&gt;“There’s a lot of unknown around content value [and] the monetization potential,” Midha says. “There’s also the need to maintain much more flexibility given the industry is still transforming around us. As a result, it’s not a big surprise that the negotiations are much more complex and taking longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS1oLI"&gt;Youtube TV and Disney may be resolved, but the tight turnaround may just suggest the strategy works — wait till the last second, alert consumers, and fight for a better deal — and we’ll see more in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New World is getting exclusive Wheel of Time gear through Twitch drops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HzNVFF3GeUOXyA2kHsNtAmaC_Y4=/0x268:1080x988/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297604/WOT___NW_Items.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6QgWV"&gt;Amazon has announced that it’ll be adding exclusive items to Amazon Games’ popular MMORPG &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; from Amazon Prime Video’s &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time &lt;/em&gt;TV series, which fans can obtain by &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/twitch-drops"&gt;watching special streams&lt;/a&gt; on Amazon’s Twitch streaming service, in a breathtaking example of cross-company synergy for Amazon’s various properties and titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMJfRx"&gt;The eligible “drops enabled” streams will kick off on December 24th at 12AM ET and will include watch-along parties for &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Times&lt;/em&gt;’s first season finale hosted on Twitch. &lt;em&gt;The Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; promotion is set to run through January 12th at 3AM ET and will require that fans watch a total of seven cumulative hours of eligible streams (or nearly as long as it would take to actually watch the eight-episode first season of the show) to earn all the various digital goodies in the drop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDhbz6"&gt;In exchange, Amazon is doling out a variety of in-game items for &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; pulled from the &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time&lt;/em&gt; show, including Tam’s heron-marked blade, a barbed sword wielded by the villainous Trollocs, cloaks worn by the Red Ajah and Children of the Light organizations, and the outfits for Egwene and Nynaeve. Players will also be able to earn a crest with the &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Time’s&lt;/em&gt; ouroboros logo on it to use for their in-game company, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EPA issues new rule to curb tailpipe pollution, fight climate change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Sues EPA Over Ruling Blocking State Emissions Law" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYh0O7HUUFbBD-9UGomhlTEBxHk=/0x1:3501x2335/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297558/78713689.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Paul Morris/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rOcLny"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency issued a new rule today aimed at reducing tailpipe pollution from cars and light-duty trucks — an effort by President Joe Biden to return to the fuel economy standards put in place by Barack Obama nearly a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ciEaP"&gt;Under the rule, passenger vehicles would be required to achieve an average of 55 miles of travel per gallon of gasoline (mpg) by 2026 — slightly over Obama’s goal of 54 mpg, but a major increase over the 38-mpg rule put in place by President Donald Trump. The EPA estimates the new standard would prevent the release of 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide through 2050 and will save car owners $420 billion in fuel costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBUutA"&gt;EPA Administrator Michael Regan called it “the most ambitious vehicle pollution standards for greenhouse gases ever established,” adding, “The standards are achievable, affordable, and will deliver a significant pollution reduction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mgYG3X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the most ambitious vehicle pollution standards for greenhouse gases ever established”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ii0k91"&gt;The new fuel economy standards are the latest effort by the Biden Administration to reduce air pollution in the broader fight against climate change. Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824500/biden-executive-order-climate-change-carbon-emissions-electric-vehicles"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; directing the federal government to spend billions of dollars to purchase electric vehicles, upgrade federal buildings, and leverage the power of the government to shift to cleaner forms of electricity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjtnui"&gt;The administration will need to rely more heavily on executive actions to fight climate change after Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) came out against Biden’s Build Back Better proposal, which would have enacted a slate of environmental initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojbMgw"&gt;The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days, applies to vehicle model years 2023 to 2026. They’re seen as a return of Obama’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) rules from 2012 that required automakers to manufacture more efficient, less polluting vehicles. Those rules were rolled back under President Donald Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;who sought to weaken the rule&lt;/a&gt; and allow the auto industry to make dirtier cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3qiZjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new rule, which takes effect in 60 days, applies to vehicle model years 2023 to 2026&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQ5d2T"&gt;Advocates applauded the new rule as a victory for the environment and public health. “Climate change impacts the health of every American — now and for every future generation,” American Lung Association National President and CEO Harold P. Wimmer said in a statement. “These greenhouse gas standards are a critical steppingstone to climate and clean air benefits that are desperately needed in communities throughout the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXw2bJ"&gt;The auto industry, meanwhile, signaled that more will need to be done to help spur increases in electric vehicle sales, including tax breaks such as those included in the Build Back Better plan that now looks uncertain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6Ogbo"&gt;“Achieving the goals of this final rule will undoubtedly require enactment of supportive governmental policies,” said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies for the auto industry, “including consumer incentives, substantial infrastructure growth, fleet requirements, and support for U.S. manufacturing and supply chain development.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb tightens ‘anti-party’ rules for rentals as New Year’s Eve approaches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Airbnb logo displayed on a smartphone " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfvjXQJFxCfEF3YTWZwXndpM-jg=/79x0:3465x2257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70297544/1234731223.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airbnb is cracking down on New Year’s Eve parties | Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3et0AT"&gt;Airbnb said Monday it’s tightening &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/airbnb-announces-plan-to-crack-down-on-new-years-eve-parties/"&gt;its policy&lt;/a&gt; restrictions on New Year’s Eve parties, adding “anti-party” restrictions to some three-night rentals for guests without a history of positive reviews on the platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gvh41"&gt;In the US, Canada, Brazil, the UK, France, Spain, Australia, and New Zealand, guests without a history of positive reviews on Airbnb’s platform can’t make one-night, two-night, and now three-night reservations for an entire house that “may pose heightened risks for unauthorized parties.” Airbnb said it would be focusing on local reservations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgAxfk"&gt;Guests on the platform who have a history of positive reviews from Airbnb hosts won’t be subject to the restrictions, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G62zlJ"&gt;Airbnb &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948759/airbnb-brian-chesky-bans-party-houses-halloween-orinda-california-shooting"&gt;banned “party houses”&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 following a fatal shooting during a large Halloween party at a rental in California. &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/47f1797489eb4ab3928cd56aacfbfcec"&gt;Five people died&lt;/a&gt; in the shooting, and local news reports said there were more than 100 people in the house at the time. In August 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377408/airbnb-global-ban-house-parties-coronavirus"&gt;said it was adding restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to adhere to local health departments’ social distancing requirements for large in-person gatherings, imposing an occupancy cap of 16 people. Hosts or guests on Airbnb who try to evade the rules could be subject to a ban from the platform or even possible legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rts7wR"&gt;During the early days of the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F2839%2Fhealth-and-safety-requirements-for-airbnb-stays&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Airbnb put into place guidelines&lt;/a&gt; for hosts and guests, and its &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Fhelp%2Farticle%2F2701%2Fextenuating-circumstances-policy-and-the-coronavirus-covid19&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extenuating circumstances policy&lt;/a&gt; could be applied if a guest or host becomes infected. It’s updated those rules as pandemic conditions have warranted and added filters for guests to find listings with flexible cancellation policies. While the company hasn’t implemented any new policies amid the rapid spread of the omicron variant of COVID-19, spokesperson Ben Breit confirmed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the guidelines from earlier in the pandemic would still apply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2ssWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
