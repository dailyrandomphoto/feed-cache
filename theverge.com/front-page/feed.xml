    <title>If your iPhone 12’s earpiece failed, Apple might fix it for free</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hA8Nb3FZLVe0e23sXqlok6_Yg5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69786179/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oX86cP"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;announced a service program&lt;/a&gt; to fix failing receivers on iPhone 12 and 12 Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/27/apple-launches-new-iphone-12-service-program-for-no-sound-issues/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says that non-Mini or Max phones made between October 2020 and April 2021 may have an issue where no sound comes out of the earpiece when making or receiving calls, and that it’ll fix the issue for free as part of the new program. According to Apple, the problem is caused by a component in the receiver module failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o14osJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-12-and-iphone-12-pro-service-program-for-no-sound-issues#ntf"&gt;Apple’s page&lt;/a&gt; says that only a “very small percentage” of devices may be affected. While it can be hard to tell what Apple means by “small percentage” (it &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks"&gt;infamously used the phrase&lt;/a&gt; when describing the number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246223/macbook-keyboard-butterfly-magic-pro-apple-design"&gt;butterfly keyboards&lt;/a&gt; that experienced issues), it doesn’t appear that the earpiece issue is widespread — searching for reports of failing receivers on Reddit or Twitter only turned up a few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9OQk3M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The issue covered doesn’t seem widespread&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAPIFk"&gt;Still, for those with these phones, it’s nice to know that if your earpiece starts to go you’ll have some recourse. While all iPhone 12s are still under Apple’s one year warranty, the service program covers devices for two years after purchase, giving your earpiece an extra year of coverage. There is one thing to note if you’ve got this problem and are looking to send your phone in, though: Apple says that if your screen is cracked, it’ll have to be fixed before it’ll carry out the receiver repair. While the earpiece fix won’t cost you anything, the screen damage repair could, so just be aware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBPwF3"&gt;Apple also says that phones “will be examined prior to any service” to make sure they’re eligible for the program. This likely means that you won’t be getting a free fix if you’re like me and broke your phone’s receiver by accidentally spilling boiling hot pickling liquid into it. C’est la vie.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus orders new series Players from American Vandal creators  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57Zg2qatvSEm-uieOMnRCQwAt4o=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785956/Paramount_Plus.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ViacomCBS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pkZ2j"&gt;Paramount Plus has ordered a new documentary-style comedic series titled &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt; that will delve into a fictional professional League of Legends esports team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrvIMu"&gt;The series is co-created and executive produced by Tony Yacenda and Dan Perrault, the comedic minds behind Netflix’s critical breakout&lt;em&gt; American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;, which memorably gave us a pair of riveting — albeit disturbed — mysteries about fictional crimes involving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;dick vandalism&lt;/a&gt; and the mastermind behind an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17763640/american-vandal-season-2-jokes-comedy-netflix"&gt;explosive diarrhea incident&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i0mHf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;, also a mockumentary, will follow an esports team gunning for a championship after years of misfortune. The series will involve a clash of egos between a 17-year-old rookie, the team’s “prodigy,” and a veteran 27-year-old. What could &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; go wrong? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pCHy7X"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jwrr6aIWeus?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZzqXV"&gt;Yacenda, who directed FXX comedy series &lt;em&gt;Dave&lt;/em&gt;, will direct &lt;em&gt;Players&lt;/em&gt;. The series is being produced by CBS Studios in partnership with Funny Or Die, which was attached to Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;. Paramount Plus offered sparse detail about the series beyond stating Players “will explore the world of esports.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymrato"&gt;But given that &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt;’s two-series run delivered frankly inspired plotlines about penis graffiti and a Turd Burglar — somehow managing to set a new bar for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339154/american-vandal-netflix-mockumentary-making-a-murderer-instagram-snapchat-documentary"&gt;future of documentary storytelling&lt;/a&gt; in the process — we’re in for a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZksHbZ"&gt;Paramount Plus (formerly CBS All Access) has only had a handful of originals that drummed up any significant fanfare. But given the cultural impact of &lt;em&gt;American Vandal&lt;/em&gt; — which managed to make us seriously ask ourselves, “Who dick the dicks?” — this series has the potential to be one of the service’s biggest comedy debuts since it launched.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chicago sues DoorDash and Grubhub for ‘unfair and deceptive’ practices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmSdJcox8yz86YXH_dWaB9nNBy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785693/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUlMKV"&gt;The city of Chicago has sued food delivery services DoorDash and Grubhub for allegedly using deceptive and unfair tactics that hurt restaurants during the coronavirus pandemic. The two lawsuits accuse the services of a panoply of misconduct, including falsely advertising delivery services for restaurants without their consent, charging misleading fees to customers, and hiding the costs that they added to a meal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1hwXl"&gt;“It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times, using unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat,” &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2021/august/LawsuitGrubhubDoorDash.html"&gt;said Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot&lt;/a&gt;, who filed the complaints alongside Acting Business Affairs and Consumer Protection (BACP) Commissioner Kenneth Meyer, and corporation counsel Celia Meza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="F2GyUb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="achhBT"&gt;The suits apparently stem from a collaboration between the BACP and the City of Chicago Law Department, and they assert claims based on the Chicago Municipal Code. But they echo incidents cited in other lawsuits and public controversies. &lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2021/August/GrubhubComplaint.pdf"&gt;Grubhub’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, claims the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206019/grubhub-restaurants-250-discounts-coronavirus"&gt;harshly criticized “Supper for Support” discount&lt;/a&gt; “was so deceptive that it was forced to issue corrective statements nationally.” Among many other issues, it also singles out &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/venessawong/grubhub-phone-order-call-fee-coronavirus"&gt;Grubhub’s practice&lt;/a&gt; of publicizing phone numbers that direct callers to restaurants but quietly add their own fees, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19154220/grubhub-seamless-fake-restaurant-domain-names-commission-fees"&gt;making “imposter” versions&lt;/a&gt; of restaurant websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAXM1M"&gt;Grubhub denied the accusations. “We are deeply disappointed by Mayor Lightfoot’s decision to file this baseless lawsuit. Every single allegation is categorically wrong and we will aggressively defend our business practices. We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Grubhub says it discontinued phone orders on August 23rd, although users can still place a Grubhub order through a representative over the phone, and it no longer makes the websites in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A03giV"&gt;This is the second recent government lawsuit against Grubhub. In July, Massachusetts &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-sues-grubhub-for-charging-restaurants-illegally-high-fees-during-covid-19-public-health-emergency"&gt;Attorney General Maura Healey sued it&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly exceeding a local 15 percent cap on fees to restaurants — a charge that is also present in the Chicago complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCC74Y"&gt;DoorDash is similarly accused of getting around &lt;a href="https://chicago.eater.com/2021/5/26/22455048/chicago-third-party-delivery-cap-extension-blocked-doordash-grubhub-uber-eats"&gt;Chicago’s 15 percent cap&lt;/a&gt; with a $1.50 “Chicago Fee” that “misleadingly conveyed to consumers that the city was imposing this fee and receiving the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y8krVt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The claims echo earlier complaints about both companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6g5dCb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/mayor/Press%20Room/Press%20Releases/2021/August/DoorDashComplaint.pdf"&gt;DoorDash’s lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; also includes a shot against the company’s tipping policy — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708212/doordash-delivery-tip-theft-policy-change-tony-xu-tweets"&gt;which solicited “tips”&lt;/a&gt; to pay drivers’ existing wages rather than actually passing them on as a bonus. (DoorDash announced that it would change the policy in 2019.) “DoorDash misled consumers in Chicago to believe that they were using the ‘tip’ feature on the DoorDash Platform to supplement the income of the driver who delivered their food, over and above the base pay DoorDash provided. Instead, DoorDash largely used the consumer’s ‘tip’ to subsidize its own agreed payment to the driver,” the suit says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfHbbB"&gt;DoorDash also denied the suit’s merits. “This lawsuit is baseless. It is a waste of taxpayer resources, and Chicagoans should be outraged. DoorDash has stood with the City of Chicago throughout the pandemic, waiving fees for restaurants, providing $500,000 in direct grants, creating strong earning opportunities, and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need,” said a spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Last year it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/doordash-settles-lawsuit-for-2-5m-over-deceptive-tipping-practices/"&gt;settled a Washington, DC lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; over its tipping policy for $2.5 million; the settlement did not include an admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are struggling with ivermectin misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An assortment of boxes and blister packs of ivermectin." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y0QoalsRfAt7z-3oDu9GxwDoUvg=/0x34:5333x3589/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785427/1232982770.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivermectin tablets.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Soumyabrata Roy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E4ieLf"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, and Facebook are dealing with waves of content about ivermectin, an anti-parasite drug that has picked up traction among anti-vaxxers as a COVID-19 treatment. Sales of ivermectin meant for animals, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/ivermectin-covid-19-warning-injuries/index.html"&gt;calls to poison control centers&lt;/a&gt;, have increased enough that the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;issued a consumer update&lt;/a&gt; explaining why people shouldn’t take it to treat or prevent COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mMCeoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ML7E7P"&gt;On TikTok, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/tiktok-covid-cures-ivermectin-horse-deworming-medication-1216268/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found videos, some of which had more than a million views, promoting ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment under tags like #ivermectin4covid and #ivermectinworks. TikTok has since removed the videos for violating community guidelines and blocked the tags, and a spokesperson says TikTok will continue removing related videos and hashtags. The #ivermectin tag is still up, though many of the most popular videos in the tag are of healthcare professionals debunking misinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWxMYR"&gt;On Reddit this week, moderators of several hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx3gw/reddit-responds-to-calls-from-moderators-to-fight-disinformation"&gt;called on the platform&lt;/a&gt; to take action against COVID-19 misinformation, including banning subreddits that spread medical disinformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoILsj"&gt;Disagreeing with the requests for outright bans, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/"&gt;shared a response&lt;/a&gt; in r/announcements, saying “Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus.” The post goes on to say that Reddit will take action when people promote fraud or encourage harm, as well as quarantine certain subreddits so that they don’t appear in searches and can’t be accessed without logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yInsW6"&gt;Moderators &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pcb67h/response_to_yesterdays_admin_post/"&gt;criticized Huffman’s post&lt;/a&gt;, saying subreddits that promote the use of ivermectin encourage harm but have been allowed to stay. According to a spokesperson, Reddit is currently reviewing r/ivermectin and related communities on the site. Reddit recently &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgqmg/reddit-quarantine-nonewnormal"&gt;quarantined r/NoNewNormal&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-mask, anti-vax subreddit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Q9pXG"&gt;People in Facebook groups have also been sharing misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ewzn/facebook-is-allowing-ivermectin-ads-at-a-time-when-it-really-shouldnt"&gt;making sponsored posts&lt;/a&gt; that promote and advertise ivermectin for treating or preventing COVID-19. Facebook has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583809/joe-biden-facebook-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-misinformation-killing-people"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; for the amount of COVID-19 misinformation that circulates on the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAF2LO"&gt;According to a spokesperson, Facebook removes content “that attempts to buy, sell, donate or ask for Ivermectin.” They added, “We also enforce against any account or group that violates our COVID-19 and vaccine policies, including claims that Ivermectin is a guaranteed cure or guaranteed prevention, and we don’t allow ads promoting Ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.” Still, public and private anti-vax groups try to dodge moderation by &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;using euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “ivm” or “moo juice” for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKriKU"&gt;TikTok, Reddit, Facebook, and other social sites have struggled throughout the pandemic to reckon with the rapid spread of medical misinformation. Platforms have updated their policies, added links to authorities like the CDC, and removed millions of posts. But as the pandemic continues and misinformation evolves, real solutions — social distancing, masking, and vaccines — remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Windows 11 upgrade situation just got less and more confusing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGSt4A9X-ruvQycynGCOIo0iVaE=/0x46:2100x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785174/Windows_11_PC_Devices.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQhjbJ"&gt;In June, we wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555371/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-hardware-requirements-tpm-response"&gt;that Windows 11 will leave millions of PCs behind&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly because their processors aren’t as new and fully featured as Microsoft would like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKX5Su"&gt;This morning, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22408235"&gt;Microsoft revealed a change of plan to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it won’t &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; abandon those millions of PCs, because you’ll be able to manually install the downloadable Windows 11 ISO on whatever you want. The company’s also extending its official CPU compatibility list to a bunch of Intel’s most expensive Xeon workstation processors and its most expensive line of Core X desktop CPUs — and, tellingly, the less powerful Intel chip it shipped in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/19/18102490/microsoft-surface-studio-2-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Surface Studio 2&lt;/a&gt;, so it no longer has to defend the idea of abandoning a flagship product &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Studio-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that it still continues to sell brand-new&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4yjY3"&gt;But while it might seem like Microsoft’s opening up the floodgates, the confusing reality of Windows 11 upgrades hasn’t changed&lt;em&gt; quite&lt;/em&gt; as much as you might think. While DIY PC gamers, IT admins, and other power users will be able to perform a clean install of Windows 11 on existing hardware dating back years, it’s not encouraging that at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdUaK2"&gt;First and perhaps most important, Microsoft informed us after we published this story that if  your computer doesn’t meet the system requirements, it may not be entitled to get Windows Updates, even security ones. We’re asking Microsoft for clarification on that now. But secondly, it still sounds like Microsoft will be encouraging millions of people to replace their perfectly good Windows PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxQa4u"&gt;Imagine for a moment that you’ve never heard of an ISO; you’re hoping to upgrade your aging machine to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;the refreshing yet familiar Windows 11&lt;/a&gt; this fall; and you want to know if it’ll work. You might well fire up Microsoft’s PC Health Check app, because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550951/microsoft-pc-health-checkup-app-update-windows-11-compatibility-tool-details"&gt;that’s the exact tool&lt;/a&gt; the company is advertising for that purpose. But that tool might lead you astray. Microsoft tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that app will still&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;check your CPU against Microsoft’s list of supported processors — and direct you to “relevant support articles that include potential remediation steps” if you don’t have the chips that Microsoft prefers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MjsgFY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10721063"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjcUZB"&gt;Most Windows PC owners probably won’t bother with a compatibility checker app, of course. They’ll just wait for the Windows Update that can automatically bring it to them for free, much like how Windows 10 was a free update when it arrived in 2015. But here, again, Microsoft will only be updating computers with supported CPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUgCBn"&gt;Avoiding automatic updates for CPUs that aren’t supported makes some amount of sense: Microsoft doesn’t want to be blamed if it makes your Windows experience worse, and it can’t test every single configuration under the sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1dREi"&gt;But how much worse is worse? Microsoft makes it sound pretty bad at first, writing that it saw 52 percent more kernel mode crashes (aka the infamous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559852/microsoft-windows-11-black-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-change"&gt;BSOD&lt;/a&gt;) when testing systems that didn’t meant its minimum spec — whereas machines that did meet it had a 99.8 percent crash-free experience. But if you do the math, it means we’re going from a 2-in-1,000 chance of a BSOD to a 3-in-1,000 chance. That additional amount of downtime might not be acceptable for a sysadmin managing thousands of older computers, but it’d likely be a different story for the average person who only buys a new PC every four to six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jy9S0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;As we’ve explained before&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has some valid security reasons to insist on more stringent hardware requirements like TPM 2.0, particularly from its laptop and desktop partners. The company’s been targeted by some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22551193/microsoft-customer-support-tools-solarwinds-hackers-nobelium"&gt;extremely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319934/microsoft-hafnium-hack-exchange-server-email-flaw-white-house"&gt;troubling&lt;/a&gt; attacks and would like to prevent more, but it only has so much leverage over the PC industry to make sure security features are actually turned on. (Microsoft has technically mandated TPM 2.0 &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/oem-tpm"&gt;since July 2016&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Xlmx"&gt;None of this will be a problem for those who simply buy a new computer with a preloaded copy of Windows 11. But that’s my point — now that Microsoft has revealed it’s not actually locking Windows 11 to those security features, the list of supported CPUs feels even more like a gift to Intel and PC manufacturers in the form of extra computer sales (where Microsoft profits off each Windows 10 license) than a staunch security play. And it’ll be a shame, particularly for the environment, if people wind up tossing PCs that are perfectly capable of running the new OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0RzNv"&gt;As security expert (and former Microsoft threat intelligence analyst) Kevin Beaumont &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617"&gt;put it earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s motivations are questionable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VbB3Gv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In the middle of a pandemic when orgs are hurting, with a global chip shortage, MS are trying to get people to replace things for security reasons that are questionable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buy a Surface? No. Make a better OS.&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1409606411248623617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYpJv4"&gt;Microsoft is potentially about to push lots of people toward buying a new computer this fall, and PC manufacturers will be only too happy to help. I just wonder how shameless Microsoft will be as time goes on: when it comes to promoting its own Microsoft Edge browser, it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/17/21520315/microsoft-install-office-pwa-web-app-without-permission-update-word-powerpoint-excel"&gt;disrespected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310611/microsoft-edge-browser-forced-update-chromium-editorial"&gt;its own users’ choices&lt;/a&gt; with forced Windows Updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVL7TM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:57 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Windows 11 updates may be in jeopardy if you take the ISO install method with a PC that doesn’t meet the company’s system requirements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says it’s subject to DOJ, DHS, and SEC investigations into Tread Plus injuries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PFxr1ecdGgPAwBxtbuwiACgEnV8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69785053/akrales_190328_3240_0105.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CXn0J1"&gt;Peloton has said that the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have subpoenaed it for documents and information related to its reporting on injuries caused by its Tread Plus treadmill (&lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/peloton-acknowledges-subpoenas-sec-investigation-79677239"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ABC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company released this information &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/d84f3085-8c04-45d0-b6ab-0550de50c7ad"&gt;in its annual 10-K form&lt;/a&gt;, citing the investigations by the agencies, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), as risks to be disclosed to its investors. You can read excerpts of the document below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oFnqhF"&gt;[A]s previously disclosed, we have received reports of a number of injuries associated with our Tread+ product, one of which led to the death of a child. In April 2021, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) issued a warning to consumers about the safety hazards associated with the Tread+ and is continuing to investigate the matter. We are also subject to investigations by DOJ, DHS, and the SEC related to this matter. We intend to cooperate fully with each of these investigations, and at this time, we are unable to predict the eventual scope, duration or outcome of the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kpKAcv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2r72LJ"&gt;In addition, the DOJ and U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) have subpoenaed us for documents and other information related to our reporting of the injuries associated with our products and the SEC is also investigating our public disclosures concerning these matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3BaPZA"&gt;Peloton initially pushed back against the CPSC’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389301/cpsc-treadmill-peloton-children-risk-injury"&gt;April warning about the Tread Plus&lt;/a&gt;, which said that the product shouldn’t be used in homes with small children or pets. The company called the CPSC’s warning “inaccurate and misleading,” and &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;said that the product was safe to use&lt;/a&gt; as long as all safety instructions were followed. It also said that customers had already been warned in March when Peloton’s &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/tread-plus-initial-statement"&gt;CEO sent a note out&lt;/a&gt; following the death of a child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXgL0N"&gt;The company also reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"&gt;fought efforts to recall the treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;issuing one in May&lt;/a&gt;. In the recall announcement, Peloton’s CEO called its initial response to the CPSC a “mistake.” It’s unclear whether the subpoenas from the DOJ and DHS played any part in Peloton’s decision to issue a recall or when they were received by the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSudKZ"&gt;Peloton is still working on getting its Tread Plus back on the market after it recalled the device, but the subpoenas likely mean that even that milestone won’t be the end of the saga for Peloton. It also means that Peloton could face further legal ramifications on top of the monetary ones. However, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22643715/peloton-bike-price-drop-q4-results-subscription-prices"&gt;the money issues caused by the recall&lt;/a&gt; are already significant — the company cited Tread Plus’ issues &lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4836b73e-6e63-4517-a3cd-86c45ea98e68"&gt;in its earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, saying that recall expenses cost it $100 million in its 2021 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCpCYc"&gt;Peloton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was unable to comment on active litigation. The DHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about its involvement in the matter. In &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2021-08-27/peloton-ceo-on-earnings-subpoena-new-products-video?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg TV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Peloton’s CEO said it would cooperate with any investigations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID surge causes liquid oxygen problems for SpaceX, water utilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-PANDEMIC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wdp5EoJz8i5E4z859C5ujTBzO6Q=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784993/1209519904.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A liquid oxygen tank parked outside a field hospital in New York in April, 2020 | Photo by BRYAN R. SMITH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HHUOP9"&gt;Demand for oxygen to treat COVID-19 patients is spiking during the latest pandemic surge, leaving liquid oxygen in short supply for other uses, including water purification and rocket launches. As supplies get redirected to hospitals, other industries are scrambling to figure out alternatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikOj9h"&gt;“We’re actually going to be impacted this year with the lack of liquid oxygen for launch,” Gwynne Shotwell, president of SpaceX, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/liquid-oxygen-shortage-squeezes-spacex-launch-plans/"&gt;said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. “We certainly are going to make sure the hospitals are going to have the oxygen that they need, but for anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6IPCtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“anybody who has liquid oxygen to spare, send me an email”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YY2XxU"&gt;While oxygen is extremely common in the atmosphere, hospitals need high concentrations of it to treat patients with damaged respiratory systems, like people with severe cases of COVID. &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/who-sounds-alarm-over-covid-linked-oxygen-crisis"&gt;Here in the US&lt;/a&gt;, getting highly concentrated oxygen from place to place is usually achieved by chilling the gas into a liquid, which is less bulky but can cause its own problems. Earlier this year, there were shortages in Los Angeles hospitals when equipment &lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/article/in-los-angeles-and-beyond-oxygen-is-the-latest-covid-bottleneck/"&gt;used to turn the liquid back into a gas kept freezing over&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkkwgA"&gt;Now, hospitals are so flooded with COVID-19 patients that the increasing demand is causing problems outside the medical industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzOeuD"&gt;Rocket companies like SpaceX often use liquid oxygen as a propellant. During a launch, it &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/Rocketology/tag/liquid-oxygen/"&gt;reacts with fuel&lt;/a&gt; (think: rocket-grade kerosene), sending a spacecraft soaring. If the shortage continues, it could possibly delay launches — but that hasn’t happened yet. “This is a risk, but not yet a limiting factor,” SpaceX founder Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430778850825355269?s=21"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fk6esy"&gt;The shortage is also putting indirect pressure on other parts of the space industry. A gas supplier for the United Launch Alliance is now focused on addressing the dire oxygen situation in Florida, a move that could change plans for a satellite launch next month, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/liquid-oxygen-shortage-squeezes-spacex-launch-plans/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceNews &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="RfaCd7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the water utility started using bleach instead of oxygen to treat its water&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zCXyL3"&gt;Meanwhile, in Florida, some residents have been seeing — and in some cases, smelling — evidence of the liquid oxygen shortfall in their water supplies. Water utilities use liquid oxygen to create ozone. When ozone is &lt;a href="https://files.dep.state.pa.us/water/bsdw/operatorcertification/TrainingModules/dw-27_ozone_wb.pdf"&gt;used to treat water&lt;/a&gt;, it can destroy harmful bacteria and viruses, and break down compounds that can make water taste or smell funky. Chlorine and other chemicals can serve the same function, but oxygen has fewer byproducts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3etXD7"&gt;In Orlando, shortages have led the local utility to ask residents to stop watering their lawns and conserve water in an effort to extend the supply of liquid oxygen. Unfortunately, the utility has only seen a “moderate reduction” in water demand, according to an &lt;a href="https://www.ouc.com/water-info"&gt;update posted&lt;/a&gt; on August 25th. Residents reduced usage from 90 million gallons per day to 82 million gallons per day, but the utility’s goal is to only pump 50 million gallons per day “until LOX supplies return to normal in Central Florida.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKiWsl"&gt;Over in Tampa Bay, the water utility started using bleach instead of oxygen to treat its water. The utility usually uses oxygen to remove hydrogen sulfide, a gas that smells like rotten eggs, from its water. In switching to bleach, the utility &lt;a href="https://www.tampabaywater.org/Newsroom/News-Releases/ArticleID/549/Tampa-Bay-Water-Making-Temporary-Change-to-Water-Treatment-in-South-Hillsborough-County-Residents-Should-See-No-Change-in-Drinking-Water-Quality"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that “consumers who are sensitive to taste and odor changes in drinking water might notice a slight change during this period” even though the quality and safety will remain unchanged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsZcqN"&gt;Florida has the highest COVID-19 hospitalization rate in the country, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/26/health/us-coronavirus-thursday/index.html"&gt;according to CNN&lt;/a&gt;. In Tampa in particular, an emergency room was so crowded with COVID patients that there was a 12-hour wait. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox engineer fixes user’s profile picture, makes the world a better place</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WEiBGM3KcJkH9pgpkghycNfPUq8=/0x0:1026x684/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784780/Screenshot_2021_08_27_131017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i6EnLr"&gt;At times, Twitter can be a bad place, amplifying some of the worst opinions and people on the internet. But on some days, the platform can remind us there are still decent humans doing good work to make the world a better, less shitty place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX6Mjp"&gt;Long ago, an Xbox user who goes by Noukon on Twitter purchased a Pac-Man ghost avatar for a dollar. Over the years, as the Xbox user interface underwent changes and iterations, Noukon’s avatar got smaller and smaller until it was little more than a tiny blue square lost in the endless gray sea of the Xbox avatar display. Dismayed yet defiant, Noukon shared his problem on Twitter but expressed resolve to keep the cherished avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCs2tA"&gt;“I bought this gamerpic for 80 Xbox Points in 2006,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noukon/status/1428469278068539394"&gt;Noukon tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “And I’ll be fucked if it won’t remain the best dollar I’ve ever spent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84cC7i"&gt;As luck would have it, Eden Marie, an Xbox engineer, saw Noukon’s lament and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430331838933860354?s=20"&gt;pledged to help&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XWZEf"&gt;“Listen, I can’t promise anything, but I’m going to make it my personal mission to fix this,” Eden responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxJvyH"&gt;To start, Eden purchased the Pac-Man avatar, now $2.38 instead of a dollar, which, interestingly, is a dollar over the standard inflation rate. (Hey, Xbox gotta get its cut, too, right?) After that, Eden chronicled her process of trying to restore this ancient relic of a gamer avatar from 15 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QC7XKT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Listen, I can’t promise anything, but I’m going to make it my personal mission to fix this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJy14e"&gt;Eden first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430771417298083848"&gt;fixed an inconsistency&lt;/a&gt; between how an avatar looks when you’re viewing your own profile versus what it looks like viewing someone else’s. On your own profile, Xbox 360 gamerpics look like huge gray circles with the teeny little avatar in the center. On others’ profiles, that same avatar looks much better. It’s still very small, but its background becomes a blown-up version of the small avatar, which creates a cleaner look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNF1fL"&gt;After fixing that problem, Eden’s next task was to figure out how to make the avatar look better on the Xbox profile sign-in screen. Apparently, there are a lot of ways Xbox displays your avatar, making Eden’s project a little cumbersome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvLjMk"&gt;“If I were to ask you how many ways we display gamerpics on the console and your answer wasn’t something like ‘all of them,’ then you’d be off the mark,” she tweeted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uH0vq7"&gt;After some trial and error, Eden seemed to hit upon a solution. She took advantage of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1431075701566828546"&gt;Xbox UI’s affinity for transparent images&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylJY1P"&gt;“Did you know that if you upload a PNG with transparency as a custom gamerpic, the Dashboard and Guide will respect that transparency in most places?” Eden wrote. “Some of the built in gamerpics have transparency built in. Maybe we can take advantage of that here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vvk9C"&gt;To get around Xbox cutting off the edges of a square gamerpic, Eden decided to place the square pic inside of a circle and make the circle transparent. It worked, and it looks great now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JNYJjO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's a lot of fun, and sometimes, you even learn something new, like... apparently 360 gamerpics supported transparency all along?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;SURPRISE&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anyway, what do you think, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/noukon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@noukon&lt;/a&gt;? Feel better about that dollar? &lt;a href="https://t.co/zxQx7SmHJw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zxQx7SmHJw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eden Marie (@neonepiphany) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1431085190034571264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A0wjbo"&gt;Eden credited her ability to update Noukon’s avatar to Xbox’s policy of allowing its engineers free time to tinker with whatever they like within the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyv2qV"&gt;“I love that we do it, and this week I absolutely chose to use it to rescue ghosts,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3AmXV"&gt;A noble cause indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DE6OBP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5mun0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KG5sA9"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lk0IkF"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP2462775031&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7GnLRj"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay, Dieter, and managing editor Alex Cranz talk with senior reporter Adi Robertson about why OnlyFans planned to prohibit sexually explicit content on its platform and then quickly reversed its decision days later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OauTMW"&gt;In the second half of the show, the crew pivots to discuss Tim Cook’s first 10 years as Apple CEO and the rumors about some Apple products coming this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z29cLN"&gt;There’s a whole lot more in this episode — like a new gadget to remix Kanye West songs and Elon Musk’s humanoid Tesla robots — so listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full discussion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors taps Hertz board member to right the ship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Endurance All-Electric Pickup Truck Reveal Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBz6eqzykCAKFPZwH42RUDuoxyM=/0x109:5623x3858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69784569/1222922472.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EY6Uby"&gt;Lordstown Motors has hired a new CEO, Daniel Ninivaggi, just two months after its previous chief executive and founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;resigned after misleading investors&lt;/a&gt;. Ninivaggi comes from an automotive background and recently wrapped up a seven-year stint as a member of Hertz’s board of directors, where he helped oversee the rental car company’s very public bankruptcy and restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz5C6u"&gt;That experience could come in handy. Lordstown Motors needs someone at the helm who can steer the company through the adversity that lies ahead — including, mainly, surviving past early 2022, which is when the startup says it expects to deliver its first electric pickup trucks &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;when it will also run out of money unless it finds new funding. But Lordstown Motors’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"&gt;struggles since its late 2020 SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; have also played out under an intense spotlight, something that Ninivaggi appears to have gained some experience with at Hertz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3dBXE"&gt;Hertz was in crisis mode during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in large part &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-05-26/goldman-was-just-trying-to-help?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;because it had borrowed heavily against its fleet of cars&lt;/a&gt;. As the markets dipped, the company’s lenders got jittery and started thinking about seizing those cars in order to recoup what they were owed. In response, Hertz filed for bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sh3elE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453051/ev-startup-spac-lordstown-lucid-canoo-faraday-fisker"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NWnhv6"&gt;That’s when the real weirdness started. Hertz became a darling of the booming population of retail traders, including those who had been introduced to the stock market by apps like Robinhood as well as those who spend their time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;obsessing over information shared in the r/WallStreetBets subreddit&lt;/a&gt;. People were buying Hertz stock left and right, post-bankruptcy, despite there being &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/883047437/owner-of-a-broken-hertz"&gt;almost no chance that the shares they were trading would be worth anything&lt;/a&gt; when the company was eventually restructured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fL8yba"&gt;In other words, Hertz was a meme stock before that term became part of our shared lexicon. And the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-06-12/if-you-want-hertz-have-some-hertz?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;tried to take advantage of this&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to sell even &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;shares directly to those eager retail traders, though a judge quickly cut them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57KcxM"&gt;As all this was happening, Hertz’s largest shareholder cut bait and backed out: billionaire Carl Icahn sold his company’s &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hertz-glo-hldg-bankruptcy-icahn/billionaire-icahn-exits-hertz-with-significant-loss-after-bankruptcy-filing-idUSKBN23339J"&gt;stake in Hertz in mid-2020&lt;/a&gt;. But Ninivaggi — one of Icahn’s former executives — remained on Hertz’s board. The company eventually emerged from bankruptcy this year and, to the surprise of many, regular &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-05-12/money-stuff-the-hertz-gamblers-were-right?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;retail shareholders actually got something in return after all&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZLy14"&gt;Ninivaggi has other automotive experience beyond Hertz, mostly at companies that are deep in the supply chain. Whether or not Lordstown Motors was more attracted to that, or to Ninivaggi’s experience with Hertz’s rollercoaster year, the cash-strapped startup is paying handsomely to have him run the show. He’ll make an annual salary of $750,000 and is eligible for a yearly bonus of nearly $1 million, according to a filing with the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001759546/000110465921109520/tm2125956d3_8k.htm"&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; (SEC), and was given a company stock package currently worth around $4.6 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rn8Tt2"&gt;In return, he’ll have to help the startup get its electric pickup truck into production, raise more money (including following up on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;plan to rent out space at its factory&lt;/a&gt;), and then compete in an increasingly crowded field of electric pickup trucks. All this while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;facing down investigations from the Department of Justice and SEC&lt;/a&gt; that were kicked off by his predecessor’s misdeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
