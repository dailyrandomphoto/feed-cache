    <title>Motional is now testing fully autonomous vehicles in Las Vegas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfHnW-TOKaFrkLdDYKUm4-0ju0E=/0x1:1877x1252/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854014/Motional1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Motional&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YF5vyI"&gt;Add Motional to the very short list of companies that have tested fully autonomous vehicles on public roads. The Hyundai-Aptiv joint venture announced that it has tested its vehicles without safety drivers behind the steering wheel on public streets in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zndvDl"&gt;The tests, which took place in February, came less than three months after the company received the green light from the state of Nevada to test its vehicles without a human safety driver. “Multiple driverless vehicles” were tested, conducting maneuvers such as “navigating intersections, unprotected turns, and interactions with other road users, including pedestrians and cyclists,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy93kU"&gt;Of course, there are some caveats. A Motional employee remained in the passenger seat during the tests, and was capable of stopping the vehicle if needed. (No interventions in vehicle operation by the passenger have been recorded yet, a Motional spokesperson said.) Motional is allowed to test anywhere in Las Vegas, but is keeping its vehicles in residential areas for now. And the company has only tested its vehicles during the daytime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lelUPz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Motional sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8vAcy"&gt;Motional is unique insofar as it sought a safety evaluation from an independent third party prior to conducting its fully autonomous testing. Germany’s &lt;a href="https://www.tuvsud.com/en-us"&gt;TÜV SÜD&lt;/a&gt; is a “world-leading independent technical service provider ... with extensive experience assessing driverless technology,” according to Motional. The firm was given access to the company’s proprietary systems, after which it endorsed Motional’s plan to operate with an empty driver’s seat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khqa53"&gt;Currently, only a small handful of AV operators have actually deployed fully driverless vehicles, also known as Level 4 autonomous vehicles, on public roads. Waymo, the self-driving unit of Alphabet, has been operating its Level 4 vehicles in the suburbs of Phoenix for several years now, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently began offering rides to paying customers&lt;/a&gt;. Cruise, a majority-owned subsidiary of General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165597/cruise-driverless-test-san-francisco-self-driving-level-4"&gt;recently started operating Level 4 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco. Yandex, the Russian tech giant, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-51003224"&gt;tested its Level 4 vehicles in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; during the Consumer Electronics Show in 2020. And Chinese tech firm Baidu started &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/04/fully-driverless-cars-are-being-tested-in-china-for-the-first-time.html"&gt;testing its vehicles without safety drivers&lt;/a&gt; in its home country late last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnSMyi"&gt;Motional as a joint venture was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hyundai-motor-autonomous-aptiv/hyundai-motor-group-aptiv-to-set-up-4-billion-self-driving-car-venture-idUSKBN1W80WP"&gt;first announced in March 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when Hyundai said it would spend $1.6 billion to catch up to its rivals in the autonomous vehicle space. Aptiv, a self-driving technology company that is an offshoot of global auto parts supplier Delphi, owns 50 percent of the venture. The company currently tests its vehicles in Las Vegas, Singapore, and Seoul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDMqaU"&gt;Motional’s engineers were responsible for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12637822/self-driving-taxi-first-public-trial-singapore-nutonomy"&gt;the world’s first robotaxi pilot in Singapore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the first cross-country &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/driverless-car-road-trip-san-francisco-new-york-city/568939/"&gt;New York to San Francisco autonomous trip&lt;/a&gt;. Over the last two years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/21/17718018/lyft-aptiv-self-driving-cars-las-vegas-5000-trips"&gt;Aptiv’s fleet of safety driver-monitored autonomous taxis in Las Vegas&lt;/a&gt; (in partnership with Lyft) have completed over 100,000 trips. But the company’s Level 4 vehicles will be kept separate from its ride-hailing program with Lyft, so members of the public won’t be getting rides in fully driverless cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns2eEO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is trying to counter misinformation about eating disorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UOzJXOxnONv10t6VOVQJlx8VRg=/0x16:781x537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68854012/bOBEy_ag.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ctqnJX"&gt;TikTok is announcing today that it’s taking a couple small steps to try and help people who are affected by eating disorders. To do this, it’s partnering with the &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org"&gt;National Eating Disorder Association&lt;/a&gt; (or NEDA) to have an eating disorder awareness week, and implementing two new features that aim to provide resources and support to those who need it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9Oz3Kb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qzFf6W"&gt;If a user searches TikTok for terms like “proana” (short for “pro-anorexia”), or “eating disorder,” the app will now show support resources, along with NEDA’s phone number.  Currently, searching the terms only shows the support number, but the new interface will also provide users with advice on how to deal with an eating disorder. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8y6ulApq7xOOKmw9hVPalp7kwBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316431/Eating_Disorder_Search_experience.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of just allowing the user to contact NEDA, the pages will also contain a link to resources.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESD_E32CrSo74ajupEQqRX795aI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22316437/Resources___Tips___expanded.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The tips aim to help those who are struggling with eating disorders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BlZEO"&gt;The company also plans on putting a PSA on hashtag pages that could potentially contain triggering content, like the page for #WhatIEatInADay. The PSA will include a link to NEDA’s helpline, as well as a number users can text for crisis support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpyqQd"&gt;TikTok is facing the same problem as many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2965449/instagram-self-harm-policy"&gt;other social media apps&lt;/a&gt;: how do you keep your users from posting or stumbling across potentially triggering and harmful content? TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/dec/07/tiktok-investigating-videos-promoting-starvation-and-anorexia"&gt;has tried to deal with eating disorder content in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/cameronwilson/tiktok-eating-disorder-videos-algorithm-for-you-page"&gt;users report that it still shows up&lt;/a&gt;. While today’s announcement doesn’t touch on actually moderating content, hopefully it can help make it easier for people who need help to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s foldable Mate X2 leaks just before launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WivQIzgxKxGa3MMFv1zaQFtq-zk=/0x0:2004x1336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853932/d9dc24fe7b753fac85ce9bbdd7976979bdacfe844ec1ca640951e4ab6c9f0622.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Official images of the phone were shared ahead of its announcement.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dVrUeQ"&gt;Huawei has announced the Mate X2, its first all-new foldable device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;since 2019’s Mate X&lt;/a&gt;. The new phone has received a radical redesign compared to the original device, with a large screen that unfolds from the inside of the device rather than around the outside. For using the phone while folded, the Huawei Mate X2 has a second screen on its outside, similar to Samsung’s approach with the Galaxy Fold series. Images of the phone were leaked ahead of its official announcement by &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/huawei-mate-x2-first-official-images-1613994247-1984855950"&gt;Evan Blass on &lt;em&gt;Voice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The Mate X2 launch event has only just kicked off in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2yG4U3"&gt;This being a Huawei device, the Mate X2 will launch without support for Google’s apps or services, which is likely to limit its appeal outside of China. Internally, the phone is powered by the company’s flagship Kirin 9000 chip, the processor that debuted in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529915/huawei-mate-40-pro-hands-on"&gt;Mate 40 Pro&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5J0kuC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/HrMsiNPECx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HrMsiNPECx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1363819457932644354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHrsDu"&gt;The Mate X2’s design is similar to what we saw on last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;. The foldable phone with a 7.6-inch foldable display on its inside, paired with a narrow 6.2-inch display on its outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMPOaj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clubhouse promises fix after audio insecurely streamed from third-party website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Clubhouse Photo Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t4B3hDBTRRvI6W1lV5yZ-3omvoc=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853840/1231318832.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4GrvUE"&gt;Clubhouse has confirmed one of its users was able to siphon off audio feeds from the invitation-only app and make them accessible from a third-party website, raising security concerns about the fledgling service. A Clubhouse spokesperson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/clubhouse-chats-are-breached-raising-concerns-over-security?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “multiple rooms” were affected, and that the user behind the breach had been “permanently banned.” It said “safeguards” have been put in place to prevent a repeat, though it reportedly declined to provide specific details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVtye6"&gt;The incident is a reminder for Clubhouse users to be careful about sharing sensitive information in conversations held via the invite-only iOS app. This is especially important for any Chinese citizens or dissidents using the app, or any users concerned about state surveillance. Although Clubhouse is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/08/bingeing-free-expression-popularity-of-clubhouse-app-soars-in-china"&gt;blocked in China&lt;/a&gt;, users are reportedly still able to access the service via VPNs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oAW8lu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A reminder to be careful sharing sensitive information in the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S8ELEM"&gt;This latest security incident comes a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22282772/clubhouse-improve-security-stanford-researchers-china-security"&gt;Clubhouse was criticized&lt;/a&gt; for vulnerabilities in its infrastructure. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423156356325377"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the Stanford Internet Observatory found that users’ unique Clubhouse ID numbers and chatroom IDs were &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423163125919749"&gt;transmitted in plaintext&lt;/a&gt;, which could theoretically allow an outside observer to work out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423164338008067"&gt;who’s talking to who on the app&lt;/a&gt;. Clubhouse also uses Shanghai-based Agora Inc, for its back-end infrastructure. As a Chinese company, Agora has a legal obligation to assist Chinese authorities in locating the source of audio if it’s deemed to pose a national security risk, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stanfordio/status/1360423165113946112"&gt;the SIO said.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toimK4"&gt;In response to last week’s report, Clubhouse said it plans to add additional encryption and blocks to prevent the service from pinging servers based in China, and that it would be hiring an external security firm to review the updates. Agora told the SIO that it only stores user audio or metadata when required for billing and network monitoring purposes. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Agora said it “does not have access to, share, or store personally identifiable end-user data,” and that it does not route “voice or video traffic from non-China based users” through China.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp explains what happens if you don’t accept its new privacy policy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m89s92mr5n0IM3v3lkXNpcVlhc8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68853691/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="weCQb4"&gt;WhatsApp has detailed what will happen to users who don’t accept its new privacy policy in an &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-happens-when-our-terms-and-privacy-policy-updates-take-effect/?lang=en"&gt;FAQ on its website&lt;/a&gt;. Starting May 15th, its functionality will become more limited, and users will no longer be able to send or read messages from the app. They’ll still be able to receive calls and notifications, but this will only be possible for a “short time.” &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/19/whatsapp-details-what-will-happen-to-users-who-dont-agree-to-privacy-changes/"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company confirmed this period will last a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Eg9fy"&gt;The new privacy policy has been controversial among some users, who worry that it allows WhatsApp to share their private messages with its parent company Facebook. However, messages between individuals on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, so only their recipients can see their contents. What the new privacy policy relates to is messages sent to businesses, which may be stored on Facebook servers and whose data may be used for advertising. WhatsApp has shared some personal information, like phone numbers, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;since 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PCccXu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be able to receive calls, but not much else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52H7w0"&gt;In response to the outcry, WhatsApp announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;delay the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of the new privacy policy, which was originally due to go into effect on February 8th. Last week, WhatsApp outlined how it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289595/whatsapp-privacy-policy-app-banner-explanation-telegram"&gt;explaining the new privacy policy to its users&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort that includes a banner inside the app with its explanation of the new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxqQE7"&gt;The Facebook-owned messaging service says that it won’t delete any accounts that haven’t accepted the new terms on May 15th, and that users will still be able to accept the new privacy policy after that date. However, it cautions that it &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/account-and-profile/about-inactive-account-deletion"&gt;generally deletes accounts&lt;/a&gt; after they’re inactive for 120 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPVdx4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtV08j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dozens of Boeing 777 planes grounded in US and Japan after engine failure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PwZgKP"&gt;Airlines in Japan and the US have grounded dozens of Boeing 777 aircraft after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/20/22293208/united-airlines-ua328-denver-engine-failure"&gt;dramatic engine failure&lt;/a&gt; that United Airlines flight 328 experienced over Denver this weekend. According to the National Transportation Safety Board’s &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/news/press-releases/Pages/MR20210221.aspx"&gt;ongoing investigation&lt;/a&gt;, two fan blades on the plane’s number 2 engine had developed fractures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMFgRb"&gt;The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency airworthiness directive that requires “immediate or stepped-up inspections of Boeing 777 airplanes equipped with certain Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney PW4000 engines.” The administration noted that this was likely to result in aircraft being removed from service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PFrDt"&gt;Boeing has also told airlines to stop flying planes equipped with the engine, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/faa-orders-immediate-inspections-after-united-engine-failure-11613952428"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5j5g3z"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uS3WaO"&gt;“We reviewed all available safety data following yesterday’s incident,” FAA administrator Steve Dickson said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FAANews/status/1363631972682248192"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Based on the initial information, we concluded that the inspection interval should be stepped up for the hollow fan blades that are unique to this model of engine, used solely on Boeing 777 airplanes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i48VBu"&gt;United Airlines &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/united/status/1363644485423497223"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s voluntarily grounding 24 Boeing 777 aircraft that use the 4000-series Pratt &amp;amp; Whitney engines and expects “only a small number of customers to be inconvenienced.” Japan’s Civil Aviation Bureau ordered Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways to remove their aircraft with the same engines from service; JAL operates 14 and ANA has 19, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/feb/22/boeing-777-grounded-by-airlines-after-faa-japan-issues-emergency-order"&gt;according to Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YR2Lbu"&gt;No-one was injured on United flight 328, which was bound for Honolulu but safely returned to Denver after encountering the engine failure shortly after takeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0YvrN2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 22nd, 12:00AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added mention of &lt;/em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;em&gt;’s report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Entire school board resigns in shame after forgetting their WebEx call was public</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d7rqhX"&gt;You would &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; the entire world would know how the Zoom world works by now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/9/22274865/zoom-hearing-cat-filter-lawyer-texas-live-court-hearing"&gt;Lawyers can be cats&lt;/a&gt;, congressmen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276998/tom-emmer-coronavirus-relief-lawyer-cat-house-financial-services"&gt;are sometimes inverted&lt;/a&gt;, but pants are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; actually &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/reporter-no-pants-good-morning-america-gma-abc-coronavrius-quarantine_n_5ea84676c5b6c3fed182cebb"&gt;optional&lt;/a&gt;. That didn’t keep the Oakley Union Elementary School District’s board of trustees from badmouthing parents during a &lt;em&gt;public &lt;/em&gt;WebEx call — suggesting that parents just “want their babysitters back,” or want to go back to ingesting marijuana (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/entire-california-school-board-resigns-after-chewing-ou-1846316976?rev=1613862062331&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Gizmodo&amp;amp;utm_content&amp;amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;amp;utm_source=facebook"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D6MUy1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;3) School Board Trustee Richie Masadas then appeared to link parents' frustration over close closures to drug use. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"My brother had a delivery service for medical marijuana and his clientele were parents of kids at school."&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcbayarea?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@nbcbayarea&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/vgAhY90lmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vgAhY90lmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bigad Shaban (@BigadShaban) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BigadShaban/status/1362547405212831753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3OCjjR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3XaJHU7QlY"&gt;The full 8-minute video&lt;/a&gt; below isn’t quite as incendiary as the play-by-play makes it sound. It seems likely the board was just airing some general frustrations, unaware they were being watched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQsZOZ"&gt;One member did ask “Are we alone?” before telling the board how she felt about criticism from parents: “Bitch, if you’re going to call me out, I’m going to fuck you up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jt1MM7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C3XaJHU7QlY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fB9YlJ"&gt;Narrator: they weren’t alone. They were being recorded, it went viral, over 7,000 people &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/registrar-of-voters-contra-costa-county-recall-oakley-union-elementary-school-district-board/u/28581187"&gt;signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; asking them to resign, and that’s exactly what they did. Every single member has now resigned, according to &lt;a href="https://ouesd-ca.schoolloop.com/file/1500178971291/1563866277263/6727833713582977629.pdf"&gt;a letter from superintendent Greg Hetrick (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; — who was part of the call, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sophisticated hackers snuck sleeper malware into nearly 30,000 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="It uses TouchID for biometrics. Overall the hardware is identical to the last model" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6vt3HLWA4Y4aySCbtfWuJFY3b0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68852253/vpavic_4291_20201113_0429.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avO70x"&gt;There’s a popular stereotype that Apple’s computers are largely immune to malware. Not only is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/12/21134681/mac-pc-virus-malware-malwarebytes"&gt;is that incorrect&lt;/a&gt;, it appears that sophisticated hacker(s) might have been toying with the idea of a heist or drop nasty enough they’d have needed to cover their tracks. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/new-malware-found-on-30000-macs-has-security-pros-stumped/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, security researchers at Malwarebytes and Red Canary discovered a mysterious piece of malware hiding on nearly 30,000 Macs, one designed to deliver an as-yet-unknown payload, and with a self-destruction mechanism that might remove any trace that it ever existed. They’re calling it Silver Sparrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQyTEK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://redcanary.com/blog/clipping-silver-sparrows-wings/"&gt;Red Canary’s own blog post&lt;/a&gt; goes into more detail, including how they discovered multiple versions targeting not only Intel, but also newer Macs based on Apple’s own M1 chip — which is quite the thing, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;given how new Apple’s M1 computers are&lt;/a&gt; and how few vulnerabilities have been discovered yet. It was &lt;a href="https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x62.html"&gt;literally just one week ago&lt;/a&gt; that Objective-See security researcher Patrick Wardle published a story about the first piece of malware discovered in the wild targeting Apple Silicon, and now we have two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EPGdK"&gt;Thankfully, Silver Sparrow was &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;able to cover its tracks before being outed, there’s no indication it was used to do any damage, and Red Canary writes that Apple has already revoked the binaries (which should theoretically keep you from accidentally installing it yourself). But the idea damage could have been done isn’t theoretical: they actually found these strains of malware on Macs in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BeOzBK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Given all of this, Silver Sparrow is uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a moment’s notice, so we wanted to share everything we know with the broader infosec community sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;— Red Canary (@redcanary) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redcanary/status/1362558570601058305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJrIqw"&gt;Researchers warn that Apple’s transition from Intel to its own silicon may make it easy for other bad actors to slip malware through the cracks, too: you can read quotes from several of them &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-m1-malware/"&gt;in this &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung imagines how its first AR glasses might look in these leaked concept videos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ifoICACRqJ731TOl3RHV-_exFaw=/215x0:2345x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851905/samsung_glasses_lite_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="okxZs2"&gt;Samsung has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/21/14682126/samsung-c-lab-ar-vr-projects-mwc"&gt;toying with AR glasses for years&lt;/a&gt;, most recently trotting out an extremely basic set of image-projecting goggles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21052028/samsung-ces-2020-press-conference-ballie-smart-cities-ai-supercut"&gt;on the CES 2020 stage&lt;/a&gt;, but I’ve never seen the company suggest it might like to build an actually ambitious augmented reality wearable computing device — until perhaps today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuIZNS"&gt;WalkingCat, a fairly reliable source of gadget leaks, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363394302336847878"&gt;has published two new concept videos&lt;/a&gt; that show off some of the fun things a pair of “Samsung Glasses Lite” could do, like projecting a giant virtual screen where you can play your games, letting you kick back in your private movie theater, give you a giant virtual computer monitor, fire up an auto-dimming “sunglasses mode,” or act as an instant first-person-view screen for your DJI drone, complete with telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WhkjYU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/8xiot5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xT213I"&gt;The second video shows off the very similar “Samsung AR Glasses” concept, though this time it’s letting the user “see” 3D digital objects appear in the real world, a visual that should be instantly familiar to you if you’ve ever seen any of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVXH5V8MVQo"&gt;Microsoft’s HoloLens marketing.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhfvpd"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://streamable.com/o/znub5d" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G51HlO"&gt;If you’ve never tried a Microsoft HoloLens or Magic Leap, though, you should know that reality is a long ways away from the visualizations you see here. Today’s waveguides, lasers, projectors and micromirror combinations usually give you a pretty small field of view with see-through AR glasses like these. If you’re standing right next to a virtual computer monitor, you’d only be able to see part of it at a time — the rest would be out of your field of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ryVT1U"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;and..... this is the 3D holographic version &lt;a href="https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb"&gt;https://t.co/PXDAHjDNWb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1363404172201132034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rJYWtq"&gt;To me, the most interesting part of these videos is how Samsung imagines you’ll be using a smartwatch to navigate the interfaces. Short-term, that might be more realistic than trying to tap on things that don’t actually exist or make midair gestures with your hands, and smartwatch control is a paradigm that other companies working on AR headsets are no doubt considering. Apple has both a smartwatch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;and an AR headset in development&lt;/a&gt;, of course, and the Facebook hardware division that’s building AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280798/facebook-smartwatch-messaging-health-fitness-release-date"&gt;is reportedly now working on a smartwatch, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTpWqE"&gt;Speaking of Samsung and smartwatches, two known leakers &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-android-smartwatch-183330688.html"&gt;are now saying&lt;/a&gt; Samsung may go back to Android for its next smartwatch, instead of its own Tizen platform it’s used for watches for years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5kw0Dx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="HoloLens 2: inside Microsoft's new headset|62360" data-volume-uuid="8839bbd74" data-volume-id="62360" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-1" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jzvsN1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U7jOre"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EDjlO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 15 Base is $500 off today, but this Asus Zephyrus G14 deal is the one I’d pick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fr4-UXpYImSvDK6LZYSexG3w4Yg=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68851657/awhite_200319_3954_4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdEbTi"&gt;Pop quiz: which is the better deal, $500 off a Razer Blade laptop, or $150 off an Asus Zephyrus G14? It might hinge on whether you need a webcam, because in practically every other way the Asus is the laptop I’d buy today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Xlkc"&gt;That’s not to say there’s anything particularly wrong with the Razer Blade 15 Base at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086MGY9TZ/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;today’s unheard of price of $1,099 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (regularly $1,599): aside from the paltry 256GB of solid state storage, you’re looking at a speedy 6-core Core i7-10750H processor, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti graphics that should competently tackle yesteryear’s biggest titles, a 144Hz 1080p screen, plus plenty of ports packed into an attractive black CNC aluminum chassis with single-zone RGB lighting. The deal ends midnight PT Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMcPAxqZtHaUD38xNaWIsZDkzOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22318899/blade_zephyrus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uObDu2"&gt;But for just $100 more, you can currently get the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 at Best Buy for $1,199, which just so happens to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;our pick for the best ultraportable gaming laptop you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. While its Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics can actually be slightly slower than the 1660 Ti (depending on the game) and there’s no Thunderbolt ports, you’re likely looking at nearly double the battery life from its 8-core AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS chip — plus a 1TB SSD that should be able to actually hold a decent selection of games. It weighs far less at just  over 3.5 pounds; compare to 4.7 pounds for the Razer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGa3pG"&gt;That’s just based on the spec sheet: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;you can read our whole review for more&lt;/a&gt;, or our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13 review&lt;/a&gt; where the Asus still managed to blow a newer and lighter Razer laptop out of the water.&lt;/p&gt;
