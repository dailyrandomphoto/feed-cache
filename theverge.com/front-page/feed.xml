    <title>How to deactivate your Twitter account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter-app-stock-Dec2015-verge-05" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRXixVcQuYbKG2f8J43m-eai0nM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668682/Twitter-app-stock-Dec2015-verge-05.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTAiqb"&gt;There’s no questioning the benefits of Twitter. It’s a convenient way to get your memes, world news, and pop culture hot takes all in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYyM65"&gt;But being an active Twitter user requires sifting through a daily deluge of toxic characters, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226503/twitter-qanon-account-suspension-70000-capitol-riots"&gt;QAnon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/5/30/18645004/twitter-white-supremacy-research-nazi-ban-gadde-dorsey"&gt;white supremacists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147096/twitter-bot-thought-leaders-ai-venture-capital-real-human-language"&gt;bots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145827/twitter-test-misinformation-politicians-tweets"&gt;deepfakes&lt;/a&gt;, and more (although you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;can’t find Donald Trump there any more&lt;/a&gt;). Plus, there’s no denying the stress and anxiety that the fast pace of Twitter’s news cycle, and the strain of constantly debating reply guys, can bring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkRgnr"&gt;Hear me out on this: you don’t actually have to use Twitter. I know it might seem like everyone else is using it, but you can be the change you want to see in the world. You can just delete your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikj35m"&gt;Don’t worry: it doesn’t have to be permanent. If you find yourself feeling empty and directionless after doing this, you can get your account back up to 30 days after the fact. But if it ever gets to be too much again, just come back to this article and follow the steps. There’s a whole world outside of your timeline to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="r5FE88"&gt;Deactivate your Twitter account in a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ymkgC4"&gt;If you’re on a computer or in a mobile browser, go to &lt;a href="http://Twitter.com"&gt;Twitter.com&lt;/a&gt; and log in to your account. To deactivate: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SaQ0Gk"&gt;On the web, click the “More” item on the bottom-left of the screen. On the mobile browser, tap your profile icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dTd7QL"&gt;Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhMlkSnOwPg7m258g2nO7-KvI84=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235732/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.52.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Settings and Privacy” and then “Your account.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KzWYhW"&gt;At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account” " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LitA3jIQZVaxs3NSYRlmbS_cko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235744/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_12.55.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the bottom of the list, tap “Deactivate your account.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="7UxMcI"&gt;Go to the bottom of the page to find the “Deactivate” link&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="1jEiWI"&gt;There’s going to be a lot of information on the page before you get to that link, some of it pretty useful. There’s a full description of what will no longer be viewable (your display name, @username, and public profile), an assurance that you can restore your account “for some time” if it was accidentally or wrongfully deleted, and a way to reactivate after 30 days or 12 months (useful if you’re being besieged and want to take a vacation from Twitter rather than delete your account entirely). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are a lot of options to choose from before you reach the “Deactivate” link." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtAaV6R7_sMNjeMkOZ2IsY6INxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235751/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_11.06.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a lot of options to choose from before you reach the “Deactivate” link.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="coUwfO"&gt;There are also links if you just want to change your name, use your current name with a different account, or download your Twitter data. This last one is always a good idea before you delete any account; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data"&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OS6jMH"&gt;Deactivate your Twitter account in the Twitter app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WI5dGE"&gt;If you’re using a smartphone, go to the Twitter app and make sure you’re logged in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oQJUEj"&gt;Tap the three-line hamburger icon in the top-left corner. A menu will pop out from the side. Tap “Settings and privacy” on the bottom. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egstsW"&gt;Tap “Account” at the top. In the account settings page, select “Deactivate your account” at the bottom &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="YtgEPI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9139315"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQHpZx"&gt;A few things to note: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gRqd7k"&gt;To reiterate: your account won’t be permanently gone after this process. Twitter retains your information for 30 days before deleting it permanently. To restore your account, just log back in. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RPMWaZ"&gt;If you plan to create a new Twitter account with the same username and email address as the account you’re deactivating, switch the current account to a different username and email address before you deactivate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B1jAzJ"&gt;If you want to download your Twitter data, do that &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; deactivating. Twitter can’t send data from inactive accounts. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qQfvC8"&gt;Google and other search engines cache results, meaning your old profile and tweets may still pop up in response to search queries on occasion. However, anyone who clicks them will get an error message.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aSkgiw"&gt;Deactivating your account can be a hassle, but to Twitter’s credit, it’s much more straightforward than the process of deleting some other services, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145313/uber-lyft-delete-apps-how-to-ethical-transportation-ride-share"&gt;Uber and Lyft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d8VNLq"&gt;But where will I get my news and memes now?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WsSkop"&gt;So Twitter is gone from your life. Congratulations! But what will you do now that you don’t have a never-ending barrage of tweets to scroll through? Here are some other things to try with your newfound free time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I7sgQI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastodon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Mastodon is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;decentralized version of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which journalists have praised as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/783akg/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it"&gt;“Twitter without Nazis.”&lt;/a&gt; Rather than one giant hot mess of a website, you log in to different “instances” of Mastodon, which are communities with varying purposes and themes. Instead of tweets, you post “toots,” and they have a 500-character limit. There’s also a built-in content warning feature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OLU8Wp"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; There are certainly some toxic places on Reddit, but unlike Twitter, you’re not forced to pay attention to them. You can follow and subscribe to subreddits about anything that strikes your interest, from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/furby/"&gt;Furbies&lt;/a&gt;. Each subreddit has a clear set of rules, and they’re usually enforced. And if you get tired of a subreddit, you can leave it without leaving the website. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DqAlcx"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.tumblr.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tumblr is similar to Twitter in many ways, but it has a couple of key differences. For one, follower counts aren’t public, so certain members aren’t privileged over others in discussions or debates because of their audience’s size. Replies to other people’s posts don’t show up on your feed, so you don’t have to watch other users’ arguments devolve. And there’s no character limit, so you can add some nuance to the opinions you post. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E72XBD"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes, there are a lot of horrible, terrible, no good, very bad things about Facebook. But if you miss the ability to keep up with family and friends on Twitter, you can do that on Facebook, too. You won’t be constrained by the character limit, and you won’t have to worry about anyone outside of your friends list seeing your content. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YPYT1z"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Newspapers.&lt;/strong&gt; This might shock you, but plenty of media companies still sell physical newspapers and magazines. You can pick them up at newsstands, bookstores, coffee shops, and even have them delivered right to your mailbox if you buy a subscription. Rather than being bombarded all day, you’ll get your news in a digestible chunk each morning. The best part: you’ll look cool and sophisticated to everyone around you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XzW8SJ"&gt;Just go to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Don’t worry. We’re always here for you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p id="yhHXHw"&gt;During Samsung’s Unpacked event, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;unveiled three new phones&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Galaxy S21 lineup — the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and the S21 Ultra — which will be available to preorder starting January 14th and will release on January 29th.

    <title>The Overwatch League’s 2021 season will start in April</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch League Grand Finals 2019" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AVm7JbkUt3km5UMLm7T_sMKIK8=/47x0:5185x3425/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668384/1184730833.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcgHz1"&gt;For its first three years of existence, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League has kicked off early in the year. But that’s going to change in 2021. Today, Blizzard announced that its ambitious esports league will begin play in April. It will also be the first season in which the league starts off with remote matches — and there will be some big changes to accommodate that. “To take full advantage of what was learned last season, we’ve made several changes that will improve the quality of competition and the fan experience for this coming season,” Blizzard says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sbr3J1"&gt;First is a structural change. Blizzard says the 20-team league will be split into two divisions — one made of teams from China and Korea, the other North America and Europe — and they’ll play against other teams in their region during the regular season. The top teams from each division will then qualify for four major tournaments that will happen throughout the season. (Full details and scheduling aren’t available just yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QNeXHG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the Overwatch League’s remote production studio","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"},{"title":"When the Overwatch League moved online, fans found new ways to connect","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21428863/overwatch-league-fans-discord-watch-parties-pandemic"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ovmQUS"&gt;OWL features teams from 19 cities that are spread across North America, Europe, and Asia, and Blizzard says that it’s developing a new tool to make it possible to play across regions. It’s described as “a new system that establishes minimum latency connections so that teams anywhere in the world can scrimmage against one another or conduct practices if players are apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO5W40"&gt;The league’s first season was in 2018, but last year was expected to be a big one for OWL; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122974/overwatch-league-season-3-preview-youtube-hero-pool-china-travel"&gt;the league was going to move to a home-and-away format&lt;/a&gt;, similar to traditional sports leagues, with teams playing out of venues in their home cities. Those plans were disrupted by the pandemic, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21229380/overwatch-league-remote-cloud-production-studio-esports-blizzard"&gt;Blizzard eventually shifting to an online format&lt;/a&gt;, which continued through to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505843/overwatch-league-owl-grand-finals-2020-schedule-youtube"&gt;the championship game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TMx4aG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g6WtAKGz1r4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eMXq5u"&gt;The other controversial change in 2020 saw the league shift its broadcast from Twitch to YouTube, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21080731/youtube-activision-blizzard-exclusive-streaming-e-sports-league"&gt;Activision Blizzard signed an exclusive streaming deal with Google&lt;/a&gt;. The change came with a decline in viewership, though OWL says it’s planning to improve broadcasts for this upcoming season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K827Pb"&gt;For our fans, we’re working very closely with YouTube as we enter the second year of our partnership. There are a lot of things in the works that we can’t reveal yet, but we can say that we’re going to level up the quality of our match streams, add more value to watching live matches, and improve the discoverability of live &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1K0dsJ"&gt;We’re also making improvements to our match broadcasts with a new and improved virtual set, a freshly redesigned graphics package, and changes to our show format that place even more emphasis on match play. We’ll have more to share on this later in the offseason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jycXYz"&gt;And while the league is planning for a season of largely remote competition, Blizzard also isn’t ruling out a return to live matches in the future. “While we cannot predict the future, we hope to welcome fans back to live events &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; health and safety conditions improve in 2021, but that might not happen, and it might not be at every location where teams compete,” the league said in a statement. “Our top priority remains to keep our players, fans, and staff safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sPBqg"&gt;Yesterday, Activision announced that OWL’s sister league, the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226670/call-of-duty-cod-league-cdl-esports-2021-season-start-date-youtube"&gt;would begin play in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wg1Mm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohdOzU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BeEf7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="geI5NU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll never believe it, Samsung made a black phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fF3uCp8D1dcO1E7uQvdfXxfojKY=/33x0:1047x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668285/Screen_Shot_2021_01_14_at_8.11.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GQrXei"&gt;Samsung’s just announced a ton of new products: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G&lt;/a&gt; is the company’s latest flagship and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;SmartTags&lt;/a&gt; are a Tile and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875341/apple-tags-location-rumor-roundup"&gt;(maybe) Apple AirTags&lt;/a&gt; competitor. But the real innovation, the thing that Samsung spent almost three minutes waxing poetically about during its 2021 Unpacked presentation, was the color black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIiEBE"&gt;Specifically, “phantom black,” the company’s “new” version of black for the Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G. A black that Samsung describes as “strong, fluid, and modern,” and also “unapologetic,” “resonant,” and “unforgettable,” despite looking more or less like the black phones Samsung’s rolled out almost every year. Call it Samsung entering its Adult Goth phase or maybe just a way to pad out a presentation that was light on news. You can get a glimpse of Samsung’s... passion for the color in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7sbp7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eQtVzO1Rs_w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kYMgbk"&gt;“When it comes to design” the video’s serious disembodied designer voice starts, “black isn’t just a color, it’s all colors in one.” In terms of art, that’s accurate, as to print something in black requires multiple “subtractive colors” (like magenta or yellow) combined together, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fdesign%2Fdiscover%2Fis-black-a-color.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F14%2F22230934%2Fsamsung-galaxy-s21-phantom-black-phone-color#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Adobe&lt;/a&gt;. In the world of physics, black is the absence of light, but Samsung’s “haze glass” covered take isn’t quite shine free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS6tOq"&gt;The style of the video takes the exact same, “I just discovered this” tone of Apple’s design videos, specifically Apple’s Jony Ive-voiced explanation of the jet black version of the iPhone 7. It’s an overview of processes that any phone would go through to be finished with color, but delivered with the reverence of someone explaining their method of curing the common cold. Self-satisfied might be an inaccurate description for the traditionally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/14/4106268/watch-this-samsungs-complete-and-completely-weird-galaxy-s4"&gt;weird Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, but it gets mighty close.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q890np"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEh0cJCwmTc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcH6Lm"&gt;Samsung apparently journeyed through the worlds of fashion, automobiles, and art to settle on its version of the color, which should look like, well, black, from every angle with minimal glare. It’s a “quest” that maybe didn’t need to happen, or at least, didn’t need to be immortalized in video, especially because the “experience” of black can be found by standing in a dark room, closing your eyes, or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/business/products/mobile/phones/galaxy-s/galaxy-s20-ultra-5g-128gb-at-t-sm-g988uzkaatt/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;looking at an S20 from last year&lt;/a&gt;. But Samsung’s specific, serious (is it serious? I’ve watched the video multiple times and am no longer sure) consideration of the color and choice of name seems like a deliberate attempt to connect a smartphone to a real scientific breakthrough: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20813054/vantablack-ultrablack-black-material-surrey-nanosystems-carbon-nanotubes-science-materials"&gt;Vantablack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUOgyE"&gt;Vantablack is an “ultrablack” material made from carbon nanotubes that was discovered by accident in the pursuit of other, potentially more useful scientific breakthroughs. Nanotubes could one day fortify space equipment or act as a futuristic conductive material, but for now they’re about as useful as Samsung’s video explaining the color black. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to upload files as big as 250GB to OneDrive, Microsoft Teams, and SharePoint</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dZjxI5EKXYG9PrhIOM9Xteo5Ex4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68668241/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1jrCvz"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/gain-more-flexibility-with-250-gb-file-size-support-in-microsoft/ba-p/1847728?ocid=usoc_TWITTER_M365_spl100001789796125"&gt;will soon&lt;/a&gt; let you upload even bigger files to OneDrive, Teams, and SharePoint, increasing the limit from 100GB to 250GB. The bigger file size limit could be good news for people who are working from home due to the COVID-19 pandemic and need to upload large projects like 4K and 8K video, CAD files, or scientific datasets to the cloud so they can be shared with colleagues and clients. The change will also carry over to OneDrive for personal use, according to Microsoft, which could make it easier for you to upload large photo or video collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtWLFx"&gt;Microsoft says the 250GB file size upload limit will begin rolling out by the end of January. The company expects the new limit to be generally available by the end of this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMyNTa"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second recent increase for file upload sizes — the company upped it from 15GB to 100GB &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310182/microsoft-onedrive-teams-sharing-integration-100gb-file-upload-limit"&gt;last July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung partners with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to turn your phone into a car key</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdxL747p6uH9izPwK3kngBShjPE=/37x0:1164x751/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667968/samsung_car_partnership_key.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="buyPJS"&gt;The dream of using your phone to unlock your car door (instead of carrying around a bulging key fob) may be one step closer today: Samsung has announced partnerships with Audi, BMW, Ford, and Genesis to do just that, saying the feature may be available as soon as August 2021. And excitingly, those digital car keys should work with Apple iPhones and across other Android brands, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zejfc"&gt;That’s because Samsung is part of multiple standards bodies that are working on the tech, including the Car Connectivity Consortium and the FiRa Consortium, of which Apple is also a leading member. “You’ll even be able to share your digital key across smartphones, regardless of brand or platform,” Samsung’s Kevin Chung announced during the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; event today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDEZRx"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear which automakers will support the coolest, securest version of this tech: UWB. It uses small, standardized beacon-like pulses of low-power energy, preferably from multiple parts of your car at once, to figure out exactly where you are in relation to your car’s handle from a sizable distance away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjiEwc"&gt;Samsung says with the new digital keys, “you’ll be able to unlock your car door when you reach it, no sooner, no later,” but I’m pretty sure it’s only referring to UWB there. The fallback is NFC, where you’d likely need to pull your phone out and tap it to your car, like you do with tap-to-pay NFC transactions today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VvvcJOdfgzjFCSVEpoEdCK1_ptc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235445/uwb_car_finder_samsung.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AR viewfinder for UWB-equipped phones and cars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tEHadb"&gt;Samsung also showed off how the tech can let you find your car in a crowded parking lot, with an augmented reality viewfinder it says it’s bringing to Samsung phones — but the fine print says it only works with UWB-equipped cars and UWB-enabled phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZN4xk1"&gt;Every iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 comes with UWB now, but Samsung says only the Galaxy Z Fold 2, the new S21 Plus and S21 Ultra (so, not the S21?), and the “Galaxy Note 20+” (presumably referring to the Note 20 Ultra, which has UWB) will support the AR viewfinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAUJvz"&gt;Apple is also waiting for carmakers to adopt UWB and had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299182/apple-carkey-ios-14-13-digital-key-unlock-car-iphone-wwdc-2020"&gt;roll out its own version of digital car keys with NFC to start&lt;/a&gt;, and only on the 2021 BMW 5 Series. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230569/bmw-digital-key-plus-iphone-unlock-u1-chip-ultra-wideband"&gt;BMW announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll support UWB, branded as “Digital Key Plus,” with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21558833/bmw-ix-inext-electric-suv-range-price-specs"&gt;electric BMW iX&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtOt6h"&gt;Samsung’s also introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;a UWB-based tracking tag for finding your lost gadgets later this year&lt;/a&gt;, though — like the car keys — it’s starting off with a less impressive Bluetooth version instead that won’t let you locate them as precisely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s object eraser will let you remove people from the background of your photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oGktxM7rjtUlBK9MZn9YlZw4phw=/134x0:1724x1060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667952/samsung_object_eraser.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8K4gq2"&gt;Samsung revealed new One UI 3 details at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227561/samsung-galaxy-s21-event-news-announcements-biggest-products-unpacked"&gt;today’s Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, including an interesting new photo trick called object eraser, which lets you delete people from the backgrounds of your images. After a photo is taken, you can simply tap on the people you want to remove, and AI will (in theory) do the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7Vsoe"&gt;If it works well — and that’s a big if — this is no small feat. Removing an element from a photo and intelligently filling in the background to replace it would be similar to what Adobe does with its Content-Aware Fill tool. We wouldn’t expect this feature to perform quite on that level, but it’s a tricky problem usually left to sophisticated image editing software to solve. If Samsung can pull this off convincingly, it’ll be a good trick.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>2020 was a preview of hotter years to come</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otfQun"&gt;2020 ranks among the hottest years on record, several science agencies said today. &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/the-climate-events-of-2020-show-how-excess-heat-is-expressed-on-earth"&gt;NASA said&lt;/a&gt; that 2020 shares the top spot with 2016, following a &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/2020-warmest-year-record-europe-globally-2020-ties-2016-warmest-year-recorded"&gt;similar determination&lt;/a&gt; by the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service last week. The World Meteorological Association (WMO), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and UK Met Office all released figures putting 2020 within the top three warmest years recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkpFYz"&gt;They all agree that 2020 continued a trend of climbing temperatures, which is changing what’s considered “normal” on our planet. The warmest six years in recorded history have all taken place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21427943/2020-global-warming-record-5-year-period-united-nations-report"&gt;since 2015&lt;/a&gt;. We just climbed out of the hottest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21003596/climate-change-end-of-decade-2019-temperature-storms-wildfires-effects-emissions"&gt;decade&lt;/a&gt; on record, and it already looks like the decade ahead will get hotter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="222xkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We can basically expect more of the same.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zGSzuJ"&gt;“We can basically expect more of the same,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “We’re not going back to temperatures in the 1980s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNR7Hm"&gt;Each agency uses its own methods to come to independent conclusions, which is &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;why there are slight differences&lt;/a&gt;. But the differences between the three hottest years — 2020, 2019, and 2016 — are “indistinguishably small,” according to the WMO, which incorporates findings from regional agencies to make its call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsXF8U"&gt;NASA tends to land at slightly higher global average temperatures than other agencies. That’s because it uses readings from nearby weather stations to estimate temperatures across regions with limited data collection — like the Arctic. That’s significant because the Arctic has warmed at a rate more than three times faster than the rest of the globe since 1970, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-noaa-analyses-reveal-2019-second-warmest-year-on-record"&gt;according to NASA&lt;/a&gt;. So including more of the region into its global analysis gives NASA a more comprehensive perspective. It corrects for a “cold bias” that can affect other data sets that are missing figures from the Arctic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWUKM1"&gt;What was even more alarming about 2020 compared to previous years was that it was exceptionally hot despite a La Niña event, which typically has a cooling effect on the planet. Had a La Niña not developed toward the end of last year, 2020 might have won the title for hottest year on record hands down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB1ovT"&gt;The world as a whole in 2020 was about 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than it was from 1850–1900, the preindustrial period that’s considered a baseline. The goal of the Paris climate agreement is to keep warming well below 2 degrees Celsius in order to prevent the most severe effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I1sbEE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate-related disasters, however, are already here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CdIG7b"&gt;Climate-related disasters, however, are already here. “A small increase in the global temperature can lead to big changes in extreme weather events. We’ve already seen some of those,” says Ahira Sánchez-Lugo, a physical scientist at NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. The US experienced the most active &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;Atlantic hurricane season&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/national/202013#:~:text=Based%20on%20preliminary%20analysis%2C%20the,have%20all%20occurred%20since%202012."&gt;most active western wildfire season&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPqmnZ"&gt;The world isn’t transforming evenly. Some places are hit harder and faster by climate change because of their unique vulnerabilities. The Arctic, which also experienced &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-020-02568-y&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22230914%2F2020-global-temperature-record-climate-change#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unprecedented blazes&lt;/a&gt; last year, got up to 6 degrees Celsius hotter in 2020 compared to the average temperature from 1981 to 2000, according to Copernicus. It’s heating up faster in part because warmer weather means less ice and snow to reflect sunlight. Darker surfaces, revealed by melting ice, absorb more heat. And because the world’s seas are heating up faster than land, warmer water is also speeding up change at the sea ice-covered poles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgOTdB"&gt;Similar phenomena take place in other regions with vast shorelines and snowy winters. Take the US Northeast, which is warming at a &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/northeast-warming-faster-rest-us#:~:text=%E2%80%9CVariability%20over%20the%20ocean%20is,being%20exacerbated%20by%20climate%20change."&gt;faster rate&lt;/a&gt; than the rest of America and is projected to &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168697"&gt;keep doing so&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s important to realize that two degrees Celsius [of warming] globally, means three degrees Celsius warming locally in the Northeast,” says Ambarish Karmalkar, a research assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="671EXw"&gt;We are heading “quite strongly” toward the temperature thresholds set by the Paris accord, says Schmidt. “All of these things are making an impact now on sea level, on all sorts of things that real people are having to deal with right now,” he says. “It’s only going to get worse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G1lOj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1Mv2W"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy S21 event: the biggest announcements</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YV0RSC-rkbPJkorp0vY61wKO5E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667564/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8rmWgJ"&gt;Samsung just finished its first Unpacked event of 2021. The headline announcements were the three new phones in its S21 lineup, but the company also announced new true wireless headphones, an item tracker, and a few other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnCzZS"&gt;We’ve rounded up all of the biggest announcements from the event right here.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW1DZw2s8CszwwLruPWVY8PPGyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232924/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T6OKVx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus will launch on January 29th&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Caz0kP"&gt;Samsung announced the $799 Galaxy S21 and $999 S21 Plus, which are available for preorder today ahead of availability on January 29th. They’re largely the same phones (except for their physical size), and their camera module takes up an entire corner of the phones, giving them a whole new look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x1fJYPTkfuKz2n_hkJlD-KKe9uo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233315/cgartenberg_210111_4369_0005.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6QfS1q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991813"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra is compatible with the S Pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6iI9Bu"&gt;Samsung announced the $1,199 Galaxy S21 Ultra, its newest top-of-the-line flagship smartphone. It has a bigger screen and more cameras than the S21 and S21 Plus, and, in a first for Samsung’s S-line of smartphones, it has support for the S Pen stylus. It’s also available for preorder today and will launch on January 29th. Samsung is working on an S Pen Pro with Bluetooth, which is coming later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfeF9PeMncaIVpZwABYhZsorqEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22235236/galaxy_s21_5g_highlights_box.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IulYwV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21989971"&gt;Samsung’s S21 lineup won’t include a charger in the box&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4LZXZ"&gt;Samsung is following Apple in not including a charging brick in the box with its newest phones. The phones will come with a USB-C to USB-C cable, but you’ll need to own a compatible charging brick or buy a new one if you want to plug your brand-new phone into a wall. The S21 lineup also won’t include headphones in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3CyMPp3keMhYFgIcFHra0jV7fU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22233200/BudsPro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F1Gy1N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21992988"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro are Samsung’s most premium wireless earbuds yet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uBSCN7"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds have improved active noise cancellation, a refined ambient sound mode, an IPX7 rating for water resistance, and more. They cost $199, are available for preorder today, and you’ll be able to buy them in stores on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gKwRvaFw-fWFLQvkCbcQcv5SigE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22232918/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0003.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qKuu8e"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21991662"&gt;Samsung announced the SmartTag and SmartTag Plus Tile-like item trackers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4Xqze9"&gt;Samsung announced a Tile tracker competitor called the SmartTag. It’s a small Bluetooth Low Energy dongle that you can attach to things, and you can pair it with Samsung’s SmartThings app. The SmartTag only works with Galaxy devices, though. The SmartTag will be available on January 29th and it will cost $29.99. Samsung also announced the Galaxy SmartTag Plus, which uses ultra-wideband for more precise tracking. The SmartTag Plus is launching later this year, and you’ll be able to buy one for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O51FpVSG8Iljxu_i4g4xwcP0YHY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68667561/budswater.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KhvWxd"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Buds Pro are aimed right at Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds in terms of features. They feature active noise cancellation, and Samsung claims that they’ll offer the deepest sound out of its lineup of truly wireless earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22228947/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-release-date-unpacked"&gt;My colleague Chris Welch has more details on the Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m here to tell you how you can buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWx6L8"&gt;They’re available for pre-purchase now for $199.99 — just $30 above the retail cost of the bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live (though those have been selling at $130 for some time). They’ll start shipping on January 15th. Samsung has released the Galaxy Buds Pro in three colors: phantom black, phantom silver, and phantom violet, but that last one’s region-specific.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2A7gZh"&gt;We expect several more retailers to sell the Galaxy Buds Pro, but so far it’s just &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ref_=nav_youraccount_switchacct&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=a132b1c0443d9aa673bcdd905d045c6c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729413439535861358" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1729412138524734388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; offering them currently. &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Faccessories%2Fheadphones%2Fgalaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-phantom-black.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; is selling them online and in stores, as is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeEvergreen/https://www.verizon.com/products/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D86221763247419220562345969261647763933%7CMCORGID%3D843F02BE53271A1A0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1610642528&amp;amp;mboxSession=d341a7c8c9c740b195a92c70a7d0ba75&amp;amp;vendorid=CJM&amp;amp;cjevent=3add7d96543211eb807402d60a1c0e12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
