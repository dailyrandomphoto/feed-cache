    <title>Wow, investors actually just gave Turntable.fm $7.5 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSMmWn0_-1yoYZopGyGKD4Bg7sE=/0x47:2120x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341610/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.25.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9Rsfs"&gt;Turntable.fm, the social platform that lets people collaboratively build and perform DJ sets, has raised $7.5 million in venture capital funding, &lt;a href="https://blog.turntable.fm/im-super-excited-to-announce-that-turntable-has-raised-7-5-b3f676b90c0d"&gt;according to a Medium post&lt;/a&gt; by CEO Billy Chasen. Turntable.fm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313793/turntable-fm-return-two-versions-original"&gt;was revived by Chasen&lt;/a&gt; as a response to the pandemic, after it shut down in 2013. But it’s not the &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;version of Turntable in the works now, which makes that funding more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8C3KvX"&gt;The investment was led by the Andreessen Horowitz firm, also known as a16z, which has invested in products like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase, and Robinhood. The list of investors also includes Seth Goldstein, who was a co-founder and investor for the original incarnation of Turntable.fm in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwXqki"&gt;While Turntable.fm is being run by its original creator, another group is trying to create a competing revival of the service. It’s also called Turntable but is located at tt.fm. It’s helmed by another former member of the original Turntable team, Joseph Perla, who hopes to turn it into a mobile-first service with a revamped design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="info"&gt;The two sites, however, don’t get along — there’s controversy over whether Perla was a co-founder or just an employee (&lt;a href="https://turntable.fm/about"&gt;Turntable.fm’s about page&lt;/a&gt; throws shade about this, listing Goldstein as the “only other co-founder”), and over the trademark. Both sides say that the other made legal threats, and that they wish the other would just leave them alone to work on the project. The top of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntable.fm"&gt;Turntable.fm’s Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; is filled with warnings about disputes and close connections, and &lt;a href="https://billychasen.medium.com/clarifying-the-founding-of-turntable-fm-4fe03bcc7286"&gt;Chasen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://jperla.medium.com/i-worked-with-billy-back-in-2011-when-we-co-founded-the-original-turntable-dd5cbc8c0648"&gt;Perla&lt;/a&gt; have both written Medium articles addressing the situation (both with their own versions of the story). If it reminds you of the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man"&gt;Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme&lt;/a&gt;, you’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7piqEV"&gt;a16z, though, has seemingly chosen to back Chasen’s version, which has the original turntable.fm URL. Chasen doesn’t discuss much about what the future of the service will look like in the blog post, other than the fact that he’s turning off the Patreon crowd-funding. I spoke to him right after the site originally came back, and at the time Chasen said that the site only played YouTube videos but that SoundCloud integration was in the works. It seems that he’s made good on this promise, as that integration is now in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeALej"&gt;The Medium post also says that Turntable.fm is looking to hire engineers or designers to work on its team, which makes sense now that the company has some money to spend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY9wwa"&gt;At the moment, the service is still hidden behind a password, which is sent to users after they join the waitlist by emailing Turntable their favorite song (the site’s message implies you’ll be judged on your taste).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The greenest team in esports now has the perfect logo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJjJTlXA4gWdAYOWJlNFMzAzEHg=/195x0:2306x1407/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341598/FlyQuest_Theme_Qs.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPwsLi"&gt;For the last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132970/flyquest-league-of-legends-esports-treequest"&gt;FlyQuest has been on a mission&lt;/a&gt;. Though the team competes in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Championship Series, it has steadily become as known for its socially conscious efforts as its in-game performances. The team launched initiatives centered on &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/treequest/"&gt;planting trees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/seaquest/"&gt;donating to a coral reef foundation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://flyquest.gg/mequest/"&gt;improving mental health&lt;/a&gt;. But for FlyQuest CEO Tricia Sugita, the process was always a bit incomplete. “While we were doing those actions, a part of it always felt missing,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Because what was lagging behind was our design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="st3gW0"&gt;Today, FlyQuest is revealing a brand-new logo meant to invoke its focus on everything green. It’s a fairly simple design: a straightforward “Q” with a leaf in the middle. Despite this simplicity, the rebranding has been in the works for quite a while. Sugita says the team started thinking about it toward the end of 2019 and then spent most of 2020 and early 2021 smoothing things out. The team partnered with designer &lt;a href="https://claranguyen.net/"&gt;Clara Nguyen&lt;/a&gt; to create the logo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WetJpl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is what you can expect from FlyQuest forever”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m7nu2p"&gt;One of the main goals was to create a sense of permanence. While FlyQuest’s overall image received a green makeover last year, Sugita wanted to ensure that it was clear that wasn’t just a whim. “Now it’s official. Now this is what you can expect from FlyQuest forever,” she says. It’s something that has helped the team differentiate itself in an increasingly crowded field, where most esports teams center their image on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268014/ninjas-is-pyjamas-nip-esports-logo-redesign-motto"&gt;competition&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849569/100-thieves-nadeshot-esports-supreme-drake"&gt;style&lt;/a&gt;. “It was already a big step as an esports organization to say that this is our company vision,” Sugita explains. “That’s so rare on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="flyquest logo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0SXOoIqhyJMorVl7-2uXbu5OCc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538434/FlyQuest_Theme.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="flyquest logos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbjM4sFX84KaHeUOlU4p_86TPtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538437/Logos.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3xcLQc"&gt;FlyQuest’s old logo featured a lot of straight lines and hard edges, which is something the team wanted to get away from. The color palette has also been simplified from green and gold to a primary green. “I wanted something that was more rounded and soft,” Sugita says. “It feels welcoming, inviting, wholesome, all of those things it brings you. [The old logo] did have boldness that I appreciated, but it was just too sharp and edgy. If you get those shapes right, it becomes inclusive, and that’s really what I’m trying to go for.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d797vr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you get those shapes right, it becomes inclusive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9k9Gw"&gt;Despite the long process, Sugita says the redesign went fairly smoothly. After spending some time learning about FlyQuest and the team’s vision, Nguyen originally designed six different options, all of which included a big Q with either a sun or leaf featured prominently. From there, it was narrowed down to two options, which included the final design. Sugita believes that the process was so straightforward because the team knew what they wanted and spent time to clearly articulate that to Nguyen. “I felt like she could understand the heart and soul and intention behind it,” Sugita explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmBl7l"&gt;Often, these kinds of big redesigns — whether it’s in esports, traditional sports, or elsewhere — come as a shock to fans, who don’t like to see their favorite team suddenly change. But FlyQuest’s rebranding has been much more gradual than most. The new logo isn’t coming out of nowhere; it’s following what could almost be described as a soft-launch period, which also included some unique jersey designs, featuring everything from jellyfish to honeycomb patterns. After a year like that, a green leaf logo fits right in. “Who else uses flowers, and bees, and cute turtles?” asks Sugita. “We do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside Apple’s colorful new M1 iMac, thanks to iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1Fc9oVwTXiY7oUWw3ybKwopoK0=/0x272:6552x4640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341558/lqgEBjUUFgYXyDRU.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SGTmOM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has published a detailed teardown&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s newly redesigned M1 processor-equipped iMac, and it contains bad news about how easy the new all-in-one is to repair. Whether it’s the fans, USB ports, headphone jack, power button, or speakers, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says virtually any repairs to the new desktop require battling through Apple’s adhesives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jf3GVX"&gt;Like the other M1 Macs, everything is soldered together now — so there’s no upgrading RAM or internal storage even if you do crack it open. The good news is if you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; go through the effort of cracking it open, &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; says most of the other internal parts (including the ports, webcam, and speakers) are relatively easy to swap out with replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qh_UOEv_1KUeQPgNjGj5E9PPFWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539225/h3ZxqpRyhwlebxWC.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fNY1Rz"&gt;These problems might not matter right now while the iMacs are shiny, new, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;generally excellent&lt;/a&gt;, but they could make a world of difference in a few years when their components start to wear out and fail. &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has long been critical of the repairability of Apple’s devices, but it’s arguably much more important for a device like the iMac, which tends to get replaced less often than a phone or tablet. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;In our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called it “the computer to get if you just want to buy it and not think about it for the next five to ten years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1vBML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iMac M1 review: the all-in-one for almost everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yVFrQL"&gt;If you thought the new iMac looks a lot like a massive iPad on a stand, then you might not be surprised to hear that much of what makes the iPad difficult to repair has been inherited by the new iMac. &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; has awarded the machine a total score of 2/10 for repairability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2XaNh"&gt;Apple’s M1 processors haven’t even been around for a year yet, so we don’t yet know how they’re going to hold up over time. But if any issues do crop up, this design could make it harder and more expensive for users to fix the machines they’re powering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YXogD4IJWwbFeDhrxruH5HMhCPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539226/3JkYPFl2Ta1jkuPp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BM1%2B24-Inch%2BTeardown%2F142850%3Fvgo_ee%3DXP76PkJ3cqFQBMbDP1%252FXFcsPXnZUjirThn%252Fr9gCQ4XU%253D&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lydcJg"&gt;This is far from the first time that &lt;em&gt;iFixit &lt;/em&gt;has criticized the repairability of an iMac. In 2015, for example, it awarded &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B21.5-Inch%2BEMC%2B2889%2BTeardown%2F50961&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s 21.5-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; a low score of 1/10 for its repairability for design elements like having its RAM and CPU soldered onto the motherboard, preventing easy replacements or upgrades. Other iMacs like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BIntel%2B27-Inch%2BRetina%2B5K%2BDisplay%2BTeardown%2F30260&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch 5K iMac from 2014&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FiMac%2BPro%2BTeardown%2F101807&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22450876%2Fifixit-imac-2021-m1-processor-teardown-repairability-score" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2018 iMac Pro&lt;/a&gt; fared better, thanks to their replaceable CPUs and RAM, but these are absent from the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pHVaCs"&gt;“Apple’s newest iMac follows the other M1 machines down an interesting, but even-less-repairable path,” the teardown concludes — an expected, albeit slightly disappointing direction that Apple’s ever-thinner hardware has been trending in for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VTDFrZ"&gt;

    <title>Tesla is already shipping cars without radar sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ngO4ykV_s4xtvRqfTYhumvViVN0=/848x1062:3175x2613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341548/0x0_Model_Y_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0hmzcv"&gt;Tesla has &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/transitioning-tesla-vision"&gt;stopped building forward-facing radar sensors&lt;/a&gt; into its Model 3 sedans and Model Y SUVs in North America, after CEO Elon Musk publicly expressed a desire to rely on cameras to power the company’s advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RyFUSy"&gt;Tesla has been developing the vision-based version of Autopilot during the limited beta test of its “Full Self-Driving” software. But it’s not completely done making sure Autopilot works without the radar sensor, though, as it is limiting or disabling some features on these vehicles for an indefinite amount of time. Autosteer — the Autopilot feature that can keep a Tesla centered in a lane, even around curves — will only be usable at 75 miles per hour and below. Tesla is also only making it available at an (unspecified) longer minimum following distance to any cars in front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBEuht"&gt;The company says Smart Summon — which lets a driver “summon” their Tesla from outside the car, even in a crowded parking lot — “may be disabled at delivery,” along with the Emergency Lane Departure Avoidance feature. Tesla says it will start restoring these features “[i]n the weeks ahead” in a sequence of over-the-air software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4SA2a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla has tested a vision-only version of Autopilot in the beta for its “full self-driving” software&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7s74ES"&gt;Tesla is not currently removing the radar sensor from its more expensive models, the Model S sedan or Model X SUV. The company says it is initially focusing on making the Model 3 and Model Y reliant on the exclusively vision-based system because it sells far more of them. “Transitioning them to Tesla Vision first allows us to analyze a large volume of real-world data in a short amount of time, which ultimately speeds up the roll-out of features based on Tesla Vision,” the company writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqoTrE"&gt;Tesla didn’t offer any more information about when it would stop building radar sensors in the Model S and Model X, or the vehicles it’s building in China. The company actually stopped making the Model S and Model X in the first quarter of 2021 as it readied a new version of each vehicle. Those redesigned versions have been delayed, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445453/tesla-model-s-plaid-delivery-event-date"&gt;a launch event for the new Model S is scheduled for next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hiBw"&gt;Radar sensors are common in many modern passenger cars, trucks, and SUVs. They’re used to help detect fast-approaching objects, even in poor visibility, and are one of the sensors that power safety features like automatic emergency braking. While modern cars also pull data from other sensors — including cameras — to power these features, automakers like to have multiple types to make sure that there’s redundancy. If one type of sensor fails or can’t perform in a certain situation, there’s always a backup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENsj3a"&gt;Musk has, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451404/tesla-luminar-lidar-elon-musk-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;somewhat famously&lt;/a&gt;, spent years saying he didn’t think laser-based lidar sensors were necessary to develop semi- and fully autonomous vehicles. But he recently started talking a lot more about switching Tesla to a vision-based system that mainly relied on the eight cameras embedded in each car (and 12 ultrasonic sensors) as well as a neural network processing of the real-time feeds they generate. In April, &lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/R3GJMT_TSLA_Q1_2021_Update_5KJWZA.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q1-2021-Update.pdf%22"&gt;the company wrote in a press release&lt;/a&gt; that “a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnqGH"&gt;“Our AI-based software architecture has been increasingly reliant on cameras, to the point where radar is becoming unnecessary earlier than expected,” Tesla wrote. The company said at the time that it was “nearly ready to switch the US market to Tesla Vision.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Report: Valve is secretly building a Switch-esque portable gaming PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7gRf_Sryp6F-EcWBrlJ6_SLrBZU=/0x51:2000x1384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69341336/valve.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An early version of the Steam Controller.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQIKF6"&gt;Nearly a decade after introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;an ill-fated line&lt;/a&gt; of Linux gaming PCs dubbed “Steam Machines,” PC gaming giant Valve is &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;reportedly trying its hand at hardware again&lt;/a&gt; — with its own handheld gaming computer a la the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWeogu"&gt;That’s the word &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/exclusive-valve-is-making-a-switch-like-portable-gaming-pc/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;’s Sam Machkovech&lt;/a&gt;, who claims to have multiple sources attesting that Valve has been working on such a device: a touchscreen, touchpad, button, trigger, and dual-joystick-equipped portable that’ll likely run Linux and an array of specially optimized Steam titles. It should have the ability to dock, a la Nintendo Switch, via a USB-C port, too. &lt;em&gt;Ars &lt;/em&gt;suggests it could arrive as soon as the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="blzr6e"&gt;It appears to be called SteamPal, or Neptune, according to &lt;a href="https://github.com/SteamDatabase/SteamTracking/blob/3d8e7591e4464298b89c98d72a6c1b4a697db9af/ClientExtracted/steamui/6.js"&gt;a recent code dump&lt;/a&gt; collected by SteamDB:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0dYbVoUZtzehUD29UqHoZWZfsIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539193/steampal.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ3qWg"&gt;Gabe Newell himself also cryptically teased at some sort of announcement regarding Steam and consoles earlier this month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZPFcOi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Gabe Newell has teased either Valve or Steam's games coming to consoles in this calendar year, at a public Q&amp;amp;A held in a public school yesterday morning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TbKnrc6fZn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TbKnrc6fZn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tyler McVicker (@Tyler_McV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tyler_McV/status/1392172423722774528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ip51RY"&gt;Valve didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KevIYg"&gt;Could Valve build such a thing? It’s absolutely possible. We’ve written about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;a recent explosion of portable gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt; thanks to new Intel and AMD chips, and while they’re still a good bit fatter and with shorter battery life than the Nintendo Switch, they’re getting more efficient and powerful every year. I’ve been testing an early version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/1/18/22237379/aya-neo-gpd-win-3-nintendo-switch-gaming-pc-handheld-specs-comparison"&gt;Aya Neo&lt;/a&gt; for months, and it’s been a great companion for&lt;em&gt; Persona 4 Golden &lt;/em&gt;couch sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kiN6Pi"&gt;We have many burning questions, though, like whether the Linux gaming ecosystem (and perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20952028/steam-valve-code-stadia-xcloud-cloud-gaming-service-competitor-streaming"&gt;streaming games&lt;/a&gt;) are compelling enough to sell people on a dedicated portable, and whether Valve will do what it takes to make such a system succeed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TeANXc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;We play with the Steam Machine, Valve's game console of the future&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/4/5063760/we-try-the-steam-machine-valves-video-game-console-of-the-future&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Steam Machines are here: how Alienware is realizing Valve's console dream&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/6/5281824/steam-machines-are-here-how-alienware-is-realizing-valve-console-dream&amp;quot;},{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;Don't buy a Steam Machine&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X7XD6A"&gt;The original Steam Machines &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/5/8733139/valve-steam-machine-half-baked"&gt;failed for a wide variety of reasons&lt;/a&gt;, including a lack of exclusive titles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5295632/valve-steam-machines-at-ces-2014"&gt;a lack of control over partners&lt;/a&gt; that were allowed to build boxes that didn’t make sense, but Valve’s own hardware game was pretty strong: I poured one out for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;the Steam Controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/11/19/18103672/valve-discontinues-steam-link-streaming-set-top-box"&gt;Steam Link&lt;/a&gt; respectively a few years back, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;the Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; is still considered the top-tier PC VR headset for a variety of reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CiqruJ"&gt;If Valve builds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976012/half-life-alyx-valve-series-future"&gt;more of its own games&lt;/a&gt; and takes an active role in optimizing for such a system, I’d definitely be interested. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The affordable Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a great support policy </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-oi9I7P-KVhAD_xvug49ZfCuhVc=/0x0:3242x2161/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340974/nokia_G10_DTC_DESIGN_desktop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10 offers big battery life and two years of Android OS platform updates.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BvUpmj"&gt;HMD’s Nokia G10 is coming to the US with a big battery, a low $149 price, and a surprisingly good security support schedule. &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/nokia-g10-price-release-date-availability-us_id132341"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the G10 — &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-Android-Unlocked-Smartphone-6-52-Inch/dp/B093QPTSK7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; now at Amazon — will go on sale directly through Nokia’s website later this week. The G10 was first announced in Europe last month alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22371937/hmd-nokia-x20-x10-g20-g10-c20-c10-android-phones-release-date-news-features"&gt;five other midrange devices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuST1"&gt;Low-cost Android phones aren’t typically known for great software support. It’s common for manufacturers to offer only two years of security updates on an infrequent schedule and typically just one (or no) OS platform updates. HMD is breaking with that norm by offering two years of OS platform updates — Android 12 and 13 in this case — and three years of security updates, a policy that should see the G10 through a few years of use. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bR8p2017Y-BtAPtfc8-gQQNjAqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539021/nokia_G10_emotional_range.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G10 is offered in the “dusk” color pictured here as well as a dark blue “night” flavor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jElELM"&gt;The Nokia G10’s other specs include a 6.5-inch 720p display, huge 5,050mAh battery, MediaTek G25 chipset with 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and a 13-megapixel rear camera accompanied by 2-megapixel macro and depth sensors. It’s expected to go on sale Thursday, May 27th at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nokia.com%2Fphones%2Fen_int%2Fnokia-g-10&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453332%2Fhmd-nokia-g10-price-availability-security-updates" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A courtroom artist’s view of the Epic v. Apple trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lE7uk8cn9Jacg8XaD-oZq211HyA=/0x220:3557x2591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340850/IMG_2803.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Eight of the artist’s favorite sketches from the three-week court proceeding&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nMUQgm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;On Monday, lawyers &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gave final statements in the &lt;/em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;em&gt; case&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, finishing up just over three weeks of in-court proceedings that gave an unprecedented look at how Apple manages the iOS App Store. Both images and audio from the proceedings were tightly controlled (as is often the case in federal courtrooms), so the only images came from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://courtroomartist.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;courtroom artist Vicki Behringer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, who saw much of the trial from an assigned seat to the right of the jury box. We invited Behringer to share eight of her favorite sketches from the trial, showing off both her skill as an artist and her unique perspective on the case. -Russell Brandom, policy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Katherine Forrest gives opening remarks at the Epic v. Apple trial" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uZ6LAdpYyhSupMzmAg25GAvxIrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539000/image0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJW8Rx"&gt;This shows opening statements by Epic Games attorney Katherine Forrest. It was my first day at the trial and my first sketch. There were plexiglass barriers all around the courtroom as a COVID precaution, and the attorneys wore plastic shields covering their faces. When I saw this graphic, showing a wall being built around the iPhone, I started to understand what was at stake in this trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Epic CEO Tim Sweeney on the stand, protected by a plexiglass shield." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_abZ_CrHLf6xCQdDHVwojlzuvoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539007/IMG_2808.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L0NiV3"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney is the one that started this whole case, so I knew his testimony was going to be interesting. I just loved listening to how he started the company and what the game &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is all about. I had no idea. Once again, I realize there is another entire world that I know nothing about. The programming, creativity, and talent it takes to create these games absolutely amazes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5YOvO"&gt;I try to finish all my sketches within one to one and a half hours. Some take longer. I have to budget my time while I am sketching in the courtroom. I have very strict deadlines and since the news is now a 24-hour cycle with the internet, my media clients need their sketches as soon as possible to go with their stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PuXpZsG6K41WmVeMzP_ZwhV2Bi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539001/IMG_2802.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cKUMEo"&gt;I’ve sketched Phil Schiller two or three times now in the &lt;em&gt;Apple v. Samsung&lt;/em&gt; trials, so his face feels like an old friend. I always love hearing him talk about the history of Apple. I took my time here and decided to sketch the entire courtroom. Obviously it is not to scale. The number of people allowed in the courtroom was severely reduced, but there were still many, many attorneys to sketch, and every time a witness changed, they would play musical chairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple executive Mike Schmid appears before the court." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3M03qMJ_AbAmmpOuWKIxL7TnCqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539005/IMG_2797.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UE5PQ5"&gt;This is Mike Schmid, the head of Apple’s gaming department, questioned by Apple attorney Jay Srinivasan. Seeing as I am not a gamer, all of the wonderful artwork that goes into the games is quite delightful for me, but I had to move so fast that there wasn’t time to sketch it. Schmid was grilled pretty hard on the cross-examination by Epic’s attorney, but at the break they both relaxed and seemed to be happy to see each other. Maybe they were just happy to have gotten through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Craig Federighi addresses the court" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vQz-0e9feCmSqvXeGXrFLgO4Cow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539006/IMG_2801.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rylrYo"&gt;Craig Federighi was a wonderful subject with his perfect white hair and dark eyebrows. People with subtle features are far more difficult, but Craig was a joy. He discussed the precautions that Apple takes to prevent its users from malware, viruses, and the like. I make a mental note to always update my software!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tim Cook gestures evocatively towards Judge Yvonne Gonzales Rogers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHtS8KG32XOlDZ9ntO10mjf0C2g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539009/IMG_2803.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image Courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgvbQi"&gt;I like this sketch because not only did I get a different angle on Tim Cook’s face (which is fantastic), but it was an important moment in his testimony. Judge Gonzalez Rogers was asking some really interesting questions of him which didn’t sound very favorable toward Apple. His confidence seemed to waver just a bit, but he answered the questions clearly and did his best to justify Apple‘s position. It felt like a pivotal point in the trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erO46K"&gt;I wanted to put in a gesture with the judge’s hand, but didn’t feel I had enough time. Sometimes hands can take as long as drawing the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An expert witness addresses the court, and a pie chart detailing malware infection data is displayed in the lower left-hand corner of the drawing." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qpeGL-4KRad1JwdY6NRdBdKkUN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539010/IMG_2799.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image courtesy of Vicki Behringer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjjq7R"&gt;The second week was mostly expert witnesses. I like the sketch because this professor had some interesting things to say about how safe Apple devices were. I know he is an Apple witness, but if his statistics are correct, it’s quite amazing! In the sketch, I added a couple of other people in the courtroom that I usually don’t have time to include. The court reporter and the judge’s deputy. When I am doing an actual trial, I try to make sure I get a sketch of everyone in the courtroom at some point. Everyone is important, even if they are not one of the main attorneys or witnesses.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PxUJ9p"&gt;This is when Tim Cook first took the stand, being questioned on direct by Apple attorney Veronica Moyé. I was so nervous while sketching him because I knew it had to look exactly like him; everyone knows what Tim Cook looks like. I had studied some photographs of him and thought I was ready. Unfortunately, when he took the stand there was a huge reflection on his face shield. I could not see some of the important details. I kept peering through my binoculars waiting for him to turn his head. Finally he did and I was able to get a good view of his face. That was such a relief!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ytbVfv"&gt;I had heard this was his first time taking the stand, but I would never know it. He was quite calm, confident, and charismatic. He said so many positive things about Apple it was easy to like him. Later, I had the opportunity while finishing a sketch of him in the hallway to meet him. He seems to be a very nice man. I was shocked to see he has beautiful blue eyes. I did not realize that while sketching him — between the shadow from the light above, the reflection of his visor, and his glasses, his eyes were obscured. Something tells me I will be sketching him again since there could be more Apple trials in my future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees are going public about workplace issues — and there’s no going back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of the Apple logo in the middle of being unpeeled over a teal background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL9J39LHuK-1iR3yAFIs9RCSW1E=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340817/4599_Apple_Leaks_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Employees say the recent leaks might have changed the tech giant forever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hdqgIN"&gt;Even to the workers who wrote the letter, the leaks came as a shock. Apple employees rarely speak to the media, particularly about the company culture. In Silicon Valley, Apple operates with an unprecedented level of secrecy, managing personnel issues and product launches with complete authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWSzRq"&gt;The culture has benefits for employees. People work at Apple because they are design fanatics. The elegant hardware products are seen by many as unmatched in the tech industry. Fewer leaks mean fewer distractions and more time to focus on the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpoIWU"&gt;The company also has an aura of prestige. Working at Apple is widely seen as the pinnacle of success in the tech industry, even more than the company’s biggest rivals. If Google is a sprawl of creativity and ideas, Apple represents a workplace of organization and vision. People don’t go there for a few months or a year; they stay for decades. The tenure makes employees loyal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcSQsd"&gt;So it was surprising, to some, when the company hired Antonio García Martínez, a former product manager at Facebook who’d written a tell-all book about Silicon Valley. García Martínez’s tone in the book was brash and misogynistic — it didn’t match with Apple’s carefully managed public image and commitment to diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXCzDg"&gt;After he arrived, multiple female Apple employees went public about their concerns on Twitter — a rarity at a company where employees are discouraged from sharing their opinions about work. “I have been gutted, as many other folks at Apple were, with the hiring of Antonio García Martínez,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1392618677644767238"&gt;wrote Apple engineer Cher Scarlett&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe in the strength of community we have at Apple, &amp;amp; that the culture we’ve built can weather this. I also believe in leadership to do the right thing, whatever that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wSWOAJ"&gt;Then, a group of workers wrote a letter calling for an investigation. “Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying,” they said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAfjZf"&gt;Within hours, the letter had well over 1,000 signatures. It was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That evening, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433437/apple-hire-antonio-garcia-martinez-out-petition-investigation"&gt;García Martínez was fired&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="23NoeK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qAV2X6"&gt;The events stunned even the letter writers. They’d expected the note to cause a stir inside Apple, but they hadn’t intended for it to become public. “The leak was very shocking to everybody who was vocal and involved in writing the letter,” says one worker who asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional retaliation. “Either somebody is a very good actor or there’s someone else who felt like the letter was going to disappear unless it became public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWpPLf"&gt;A week after &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; published the García Martínez letter, a group of Muslim employees at Apple penned a note calling for the company to release a statement in support of Palestine. When Tim Cook didn’t respond, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446059/apple-employees-palestinians-support-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;the letter was leaked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btgiYM"&gt;The two letters, and their leaks, are signs of a slow cultural shift at Apple. Employees, once tight-lipped about internal problems, are now joining a wave of public dissent that’s roiling Silicon Valley. Employees say this is partly because Apple’s typical avenues for reporting don’t work for big cultural issues. They also note the company rolled out Slack in 2019, allowing workers to find and organize with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDwuVf"&gt;Now, some are beginning to feel that the company culture has harmed diversity and inclusion efforts. “Apple’s secrecy works great for protecting our customers and our products, but it hinders inclusion and diversity,” says an anonymous employee. “There’s a lack of education around what is confidential versus what is your protected speech and you should speak up about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BYeP"&gt;Public organizing, particularly on social media, has been enormously successful in Silicon Valley, allowing workers to wrestle power away from management. At Google, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;it’s led the company to end forced arbitration for all full-time employees&lt;/a&gt;. At Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;it’s spawned massive unionizing campaigns&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems to be Apple’s turn. “Suddenly at Apple, as everywhere else, managers can only stand back and watch as workers reshape the bounds of what will be permitted at work,” &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-hire-that-roiled-apple?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo0MzY0NzEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM2MzgyMjIwLCJfIjoieUhrVDgiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjE4Nzk1NTcsImV4cCI6MTYyMTg4MzE1NywiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.OrzoB0_ydpKdfXH27yXSKixg4BC4YNvkEg0aRslStko"&gt;wrote Casey Newton, founder and editor of &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dkfvxs"&gt;There’s no sign the leaks will extend to Apple’s product launches. This is the part of the business that Apple cares about most — and it has gone to great lengths to dissuade employees from leaking. In 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;sent out a note threatening to fire and even sue workers who shared product information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAbGT3"&gt;The company also has a structure in place to prevent employees from sharing — or even finding out about — product information before it’s public. Employees sign project-specific NDAs and are dissuaded from telling their spouses about their work. Their badges only open certain doors at the company’s Cupertino, California headquarters. Prior to the pandemic, most engineers were barred from taking products in development home from the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwufxD"&gt;The culture of secrecy has bled over into many aspects of Apple’s culture. But employees say it is enforced more through norms than through rules. “The habit of secrecy is self-enforcing once established,” an anonymous employee says. Most of the time, problems are escalated internally and quietly resolved without the public ever finding out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CdElUJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JERiFA"&gt;That didn’t happen when García Martínez was hired at Apple. Female employees weren’t sure who would care about their concerns. “For women, it was especially sensitive because the things that were being highlighted [from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys] &lt;/em&gt;were all very misogynistic, so it felt very personal, but at the same time, who do you report it to?” asked an anonymous worker. “How do you report someone who has done something, but hasn’t done something to you specifically?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjuKx4"&gt;Apple employees are quick to point out that they’ve been organizing internally for years. In 2020, they pushed the company to move away from using the terms “master” and “slave” in engineering contexts where one process controlled another, part of an &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tech-confronts-use-labels-master-slave/"&gt;industry-wide shift away from the labels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8h1YG"&gt;They also called for Election Day and Juneteenth to become paid company holidays in a letter last year. “Apple is one of the most influential companies in the world,” they wrote. “While there is undeniable momentum behind the Black Lives Matter civil rights movement, we can and should be setting a better standard for other companies to follow. We believe we have an opportunity with Election Days to be a leader that forges ahead of the rest.” The push was largely successful. On July 24th, 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-24/apple-to-give-employees-paid-time-off-to-vote-in-u-s-election?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; the company was giving workers four hours off to vote on Election Day. Employees in the United States get Juneteenth off this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NVAHl"&gt;Apple management might not love what is happening — it’s not very Apple-y, after all — but if employees maintain their secrecy surrounding its products, the firm might not care enough to crack down. Workers can tweet about Apple, just not Apple products. And they likely will: as one anonymous employee told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in the wake of the García Martínez letter, “I think this has forever changed the culture of Apple.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1U7ks"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Knockout City’s virtual dodgeball is even more chaotic than the real thing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y93kAWQn4-0xenv35RTr3JBerhc=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340785/koc_screenshot_16x9_5.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Knockout City. | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hIWFL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; took me back to childhood games of dodgeball with a single sound: “whumphf!” That one noise, which you’ll hear a lot as dodgeballs bounce every which way, represents just how well the game’s virtual version of dodgeball mimics the real thing — including all of the chaos you might remember from games on the playground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSMFn9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is made by EA and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit&lt;/em&gt; developer Velan Studios, and its primary mode involves three-on-three matches against online opponents. In each match, you’ll scoop up dodgeballs littered around the city-themed maps and launch them at your unsuspecting targets. When you charge up a throw, the game automatically locks onto a target, meaning you don’t have to worry about precise aim. &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; is more about timing your shots to try to catch your opponent off-guard, which the game encourages by letting you do things like curve or feint a shot to mix up your tactics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrY0Cg0qt15oG7YdBi0DDR4wSm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538721/koc_screenshot_16x9_1.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somebody catching a ball in Knockout City.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wUsmR4"&gt;Like in real dodgeball, though, a key part of &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just throwing the ball, but also catching it, which you can do with a well-timed press of a trigger. And if you do catch a thrown ball, it will fly a little faster when you next throw it. I love trying to time catches. It adds &lt;em&gt;Paper Mario&lt;/em&gt;-like timing to battles (though at a much faster pace) and forces you to think more about your positioning not just for offense, but for defense as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvK2Qu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; also offers some fantastical elements that you won’t find in real-life dodgeball. Each match has a special type of dodgeball with unique powers, like a bomb ball that explodes on impact. My favorite was the multiball, which gives you three dodgeballs right at your fingertips, kind of like the triple shell item in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l2kHN"&gt;And at any time, you can turn &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; into a ball so your teammates can scoop you up and toss you at an opponent for a quick knockout. Balling up for a teammate is almost like handing them a present — one they can launch at an unsuspecting person at high velocity — and it’s a great tool to assist your teammates whenever you want, without any communication required. Be warned, though, your enemies can also pick you up when you’re in ball form, meaning they might just throw you off the map for an easy point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ymh8dw"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DJVyyojmY1E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ybluW9"&gt;Like real games of in-person dodgeball, there’s often a lot going on in &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;. That can make it easy to lose track of things and get knocked out by a shot you didn’t see coming. And occasionally, matches can have long lulls where you’re running around the map by yourself, dodgeball in hand, hunting for an opponent. Sometimes I wish the maps were just a bit smaller to force more confrontations. But at their best, &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; matches are fun and chaotic. Dodgeballs flying left and right will keep you, your teammates, and your opponents in a thrilling dance of dodging, catching, throwing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkF5CN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just about outsmarting your opponents in dodgeball, though; the game also gives you lots of ways to customize your character, including the clothes they’re wearing and even your victory pose. You can earn more cosmetics from completing in-game challenges, leveling up your “street rank” (which is like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Battle Pass), or by buying them from the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-like in-game store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFazOyhPf813w4kvlmrSYM7MjR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538729/koc_launch_crew_screenshot_16x9.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s all sorts of ways to customize your character.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D3C7tG"&gt;If you want to check out &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt;, EA is offering the full version of the game for free until May 30th on every platform where it’s available, which includes PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; supports both crossplay and cross-progression, so you can play with your friends no matter what platform they’re on and bring your progress over to other platforms. After the trial ends, the game will cost $19.99 — though if you have an EA Play or an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, you’ll have access to the game with one of those, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZPi59"&gt;While it’s free, I highly recommend giving &lt;em&gt;Knockout City&lt;/em&gt; a chance. I think it really captures the feeling of playing dodgeball in video game form — and it feels so good when you nail a game-winning shot with a satisfying “whumphf.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0f5RAP"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Knockout City &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available now on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7gfaa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric vehicle startups hit speed bumps after raising tons of cash</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYr1cLpiD36BJO1-dsWkbVs05Hg=/0x2:1926x1286/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69340719/PQBU5ZZ2RBFZDJCY3QZKFRLHA4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lordstown Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8d1vKO"&gt;Electric vehicle startups have raised an absurd amount of money in the last year by merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;, or SPACs. That money — billions of dollars, collectively — was supposed to be enough to help each of them start fighting for space in a market dominated by Tesla. But many of these startups are still having trouble getting rolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OConG1"&gt;EV startup struggles are not new. Most of the ones focused on passenger vehicles that are still around spent years grappling with the inherent, unavoidable difficulties of automotive manufacturing. Now, though, the bruises of that fight are developing in broad daylight — all while they try to beat deep-pocketed legacy automakers to the punch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="41S2B5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Startups going public makes it much easier to see where the problems are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vc2GTr"&gt;Ohio-based Lordstown Motors raised nearly $700 million when it went public late last year and has backing from America’s largest automaker, General Motors. But it’s spending faster than expected — it lost $125 million in the first quarter — and on Tuesday, the company said it needs more cash in order to hit its goal of making its first 2,200 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;electric pickup trucks&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Kajx"&gt;California-based Canoo went public in December and has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;replaced its leadership team&lt;/a&gt;. The new one has upended the startup’s business model and largely thrown out the projections that were used to raise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;around $600 million during last year’s merger with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWiuTn"&gt;Startups that have announced SPAC mergers but have yet to complete them have run into some trouble, too. Lucid Motors again delayed the release of its luxury electric sedan, the Air, in order to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/lucid-motors-ceo-rawlinson-confronts-havoc-in-supply-chain"&gt;address quality assurance issues raised by its investors&lt;/a&gt;. When it does go public, the California startup is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;looking to add $4.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; to the sizable war chest it started building when Saudi Arabia pledged some $1.3 billion in exchange for majority control in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivwOb0"&gt;Another California EV startup working on a luxury electric vehicle, Faraday Future, is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;raise $1 billion when its own SPAC merger is complete&lt;/a&gt;. But this week, Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805521/000121390021028758/ea141550-8k_property.htm"&gt;told investors&lt;/a&gt; that it needs to recalculate basically all of the financial projections it made so far in order to follow new guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other startups have had to make similar adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iME4JD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic has only made things harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EB8zrV"&gt;Some of these problems are the result of bad timing. These companies are trying to debut vehicles at a time when the pandemic has put a ton of stress on the automotive supply chain. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson told &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-25/lucid-motors-ceo-rawlinson-confronts-havoc-in-supply-chain"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday that “COVID has wrecked havoc with our process.” On Tuesday, Lordstown Motors &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-first-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the pandemic has created “significantly higher than expected expenditures for parts/equipment, expedited shipping costs, and expenses associated with third-party engineering resources.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="krArAu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JTue46"&gt;But these startups also rushed to become public companies so they could take advantage of the deluge of money during the SPAC merger boom. That has left them scrambling to cope with the demands of being listed on a major stock exchange. On Canoo’s first earnings call as a publicly traded company, for example, an analyst called out the startup’s head of investor relations for not returning emails. In response, CEO Tony Aquila admitted to the team being “overwhelmed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs6HZC"&gt;Not all of the side effects of this rush to market have been so frivolous, though. Nearly all of these startups have disclosed so-called “material weaknesses” in their internal financial practices in filings with the SEC. Faraday Future &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001805521/000121390021020004/fs42021_propertysolutions.htm"&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; that, among other things, it “did not design and maintain effective controls for communicating and sharing information between the legal and accounting and finance departments,” and that it was not able to “address the identification of and accounting for certain non-routine, unusual or complex transactions” — which is notable considering the startup’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;well-documented history&lt;/a&gt; with unusual and complex financial transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99y3gx"&gt;Fisker Inc., which raised $1 billion in its own merger last year, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001720990/000119312520313931/d92481d424b3.htm"&gt;admitted to weaknesses&lt;/a&gt; in its	“risk assessment process, including as it relates to fraud risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="33zVJJ"&gt;What’s more, multiple electric vehicle startups are now under government investigation. The SEC is probing Lordstown Motors over claims that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;misrepresented the number of preorders for its trucks&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;investigating Canoo’s SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the recent executive departures. Both the SEC and the Department of Justice have opened investigations into hydrogen trucking startup Nikola, which was one of the earliest electric vehicle companies to go public in a SPAC merger. And if that weren’t enough, all of these startups have been hit with multiple securities fraud lawsuits from shareholders alleging they were misled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jbt8U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More money, more problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JqSUZf"&gt;Only Lordstown Motors and Lucid Motors remain committed to starting production by the end of 2021, which means most of these startups are still a long way away from generating revenue, let alone turning a profit. The only exception so far is Fisker Inc., which sold $22,000 worth of merchandise in the first quarter — though the cost of those sales was $17,000, meaning the company netted just $5,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L32lCA"&gt;Without any near-term revenue, these EV startups are now in a sort of race to get into production before their massive piles of cash run out. And some are already looking for more help, buoyed by the fact that many of them were able to use funds from the SPAC mergers to wipe out any existing debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nohMTU"&gt;Fisker Inc. founder Henrik Fisker has already said he is &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-25/fisker-says-ocean-suv-production-is-on-schedule-for-late-2022"&gt;open to borrowing money&lt;/a&gt; to make sure his company meets a late 2022 production target. Lordstown Motors said Tuesday that it is looking to borrow against some of its assets (which include a former GM factory and equipment). It’s also talking to strategic investors and is in the running for a loan from the Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program, from which Tesla once borrowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itsmtM"&gt;If the startup isn’t able to raise more money, Lordstown Motors CEO Steve Burns said it will have to cut its production target to around 1,000 trucks this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="GfLgwF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoQ7zf"&gt;“We wanted to make sure everybody knew the worst, worst case is we are still making pickup trucks this year,” Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiEstR"&gt;Lordstown Motors is especially under pressure, as the startup is focused on making and selling its electric pickup, the Endurance, exclusively to commercial customers. But Ford not only just revealed an all-electric version of its bestselling truck, the F-150, it also showed off a fleet-focused version with a cheaper base price than the Endurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5APYcO"&gt;Burns, without mentioning the Detroit automaker or its new truck by name, said this week the F-150 Lightning launch helped prove that electric pickups are now a “mainstream” idea. He remained confident that Lordstown Motors could beat Ford to market, as the Lightning is not supposed to go on sale until the first half of 2022. But, he said, it “would be crushing to have the lead, have a first market mover, and not be able to fulfill [that goal].” &lt;/p&gt;
