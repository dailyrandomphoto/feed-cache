    <title>Smash Ultimate’s final update is a love story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXET5aG2UuQkoW7_f2LDfDVavBA=/1x0:2047x1364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016732/EqqrzukXYAEjTBz.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AJAOTr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is delighted to announce the long-awaited nuptials between Mr. Doom Slayer Ripandtearington III and Ms. Isabelle née Shizue. The wedding ceremony took place during &lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;’s final content update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkEUr5"&gt;Mr. Doom Slayer and Ms. Isabelle are a match made in &lt;a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Final_Destination_(SSBU)"&gt;Final Destination&lt;/a&gt;. The two met back in March 2020 when their respective games &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/24/21150803/animal-crossing-isabelle-doomguy-doom-eternal-new-horizons"&gt;launched on the same day&lt;/a&gt;. With the vast differences between their two lines of work, the pairing was regarded as little more than an accidental meeting of polar opposites. But what started as a joke quickly became serious &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/doomguy-and-isabelle"&gt;as memes of the two&lt;/a&gt; spread throughout the internet sparking rumors that there was more to this unlikely couple — rumors the couple themselves were more than happy to contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nfwvb0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;happy new horizons &lt;a href="https://t.co/BwjwtJkpLh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BwjwtJkpLh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1345076347882893316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="K4nmyM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;will Isabelle be there&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1229892342452191238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LgihGB"&gt;Since then, the two have been engaged in a whirlwind romance unfortunately made long distance due to the covid-19 pandemic and whisperings that a match with a man who makes his living &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"&gt;slaughtering the malcontents of hell&lt;/a&gt; would damage Isabelle’s political career. Today the lovely couple final smashes those rumors with their union in &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IircSn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;together at last &lt;a href="https://t.co/aa1ZOX5PUa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aa1ZOX5PUa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— DOOM (@DOOM) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DOOM/status/1450494190945714178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cLhK3h"&gt;The joyous event also heralds the release of Challenger Pack 11 that features several Mii fighter costume additions as well as the arrival of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;final DLC fighter, Sora of &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; fame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02M7Mk"&gt;The ceremony was an intimate gathering attended by Sephiroth, Joker, the Belmont Family, most of the Mushroom Kingdom, Solid Snake, and too damn many sword characters while officiated by the Master Hand itself. We wish Mr. Doomguy and Ms. Isabelle an abundance of turnips, demon slaughter, and love.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sundar Pichai (left) and Rick Osterloh (right)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c65JOyfAhCAmjQ_LXU5BrePJ0f8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016608/dbohn_211015_4802_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘We acknowledge we’re a challenger’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xcZLfv"&gt;When did Google decide it would need to make its own custom processor for phones? “I think I started April 16th and it was around the 17th, in 2016,” says Rick Osterloh, Google’s head of hardware. He says he sat down with Google CEO Sundar Pichai and the two agreed that custom silicon was in their future, but its exact form wasn’t yet clear. This year, as Google prepared to launch the latest Pixel that uses Google’s custom silicon, the Tensor SoC, I sat down with Osterloh and Pichai to talk about the phone, the chip, and the Android ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XPbBV"&gt;Osterloh is &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11586518/google-hardware-division-rick-osterloh"&gt;five years in&lt;/a&gt; to his tenure as the head of Google’s hardware division. In those years, Google has acquired both HTC and Fitbit, pushed the idea of computational photography to new heights, and almost completely failed to pick up meaningful smartphone market share. Although the Pixel has been influential, the top-tier Pixels haven’t sold in big numbers — and the less expensive versions have fared only a little better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pceM6"&gt;“Part of the reason that I think the team has been more modest in their approach with Pixel over the past 18 months or so is because they’ve been waiting for Tensor,” Pichai says. Google has gone all out this year with a marketing blitz that began well ahead of today’s launch and continues with an NBA deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr2rrA"&gt;So now, with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, Osterloh hopes that the culmination of that chip decision paired with what his team has called Google’s “first real flagship” will make this year’s Pixel something different from all the phones that came before: something that will sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="albpbE"&gt;To get there, Google will need more than just a marketing blitz — it will need to have made a great phone. Answering that question will have to wait for our review, but there’s no question that Google’s &lt;em&gt;ambition&lt;/em&gt; is to make a phone that can stand toe-to-toe with the best from Apple and Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNqGeH"&gt;For this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Pichai, Osterloh, and I got into all that as well as some of the antitrust issues facing Android. Listen in to hear, and stick around after the interview for some first-hand impressions of the phone from myself and Nilay Patel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wl03rc"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/76UvWOsfHhNNUVsbd25zAo" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ut7whS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZEEgf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDxWDH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar Pichai, Rick Osterloh, thanks for coming on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I have asked both of you a version of this question at least a half a dozen times. Because the Pixel 6 is now announced and out, and you have your own chip, I’m going to ask it one more time. I’ll start with you, Sundar; why is it important that Google is in the hardware business?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g8sth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar Pichai:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a good question. I have answered it before, but I think it’s worth saying. If you’re committed to driving computing forward, I do think you need to think at the intersection of software services [and] hardware, to evolve it. I think we have a unique expression of it. We have always invested in certain deep technology to build helpful experiences with AI, we see a chance to express it in a unique way. So I think we will bring newer insights, newer experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WLFcIl"&gt;Second, it helps us drive the ecosystem forward. In my experience, every time we have done something well in a category, that category as a whole benefits in Android. Be it the Nexus phone or Nexus 7 as a tablet, and so on. And third, to do this well, you have to build a sustainable business. We are committed to it, we are building a business we want to grow and do well, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkFYqY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine that third answer is where I’m going to turn to you, Rick. How is that going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03mM3R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rick Osterloh:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re still very early in this. I think the [hardware] organization was started about five years ago. And especially in such a mature market, that matters so much to users, it takes a long time to build the right capabilities to be leading. And we feel like finally, at this moment, we’ve gotten to the place where we feel really good about the innovation we’ve been able to build, the organization and capabilities we have in that towards building great phones. We think Pixel 6 is a big step change, and a nod to where we’re going in the future, which is really focused around AI innovation, really focused around building a portfolio that tries to address big parts of the market. We want to give our users the best of Google. So, that’s what we’re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcH4Vy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me why you think the Pixel 6 is categorically different than other smartphones that are currently on the market. Or do you think that’s true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewlBqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there are significant differences. The number one thing is that it really is a clear representation of Google’s brand. What we’re trying to deliver is the very best possible Google experience. We do that by bringing all of our services that many people use, pulling them together in a cohesive user experience on Android 12 and beautiful new material UI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="35ZHlx"&gt;We also have been bringing a lot of our AI innovation. We’ve been working in tight coupling with our AI research teams. We’ve been building silicon together, and we put all that together in Pixel 6 so we can build the best possible experience. You see that in the work around speech. There are really exciting new improvements in that arena, we’ve always been strong in computational photography but we’re taking that a lot further with Pixel 6 and Tensor, and we’ve got a big jump in our video capabilities too. We’re just really excited about this being a moment where we pull it all together in its best possible form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7A0AK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think it’s fair to say you’re intending to go toe to toe with the best that Apple or Samsung have to offer in terms of their flagships?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIyYps"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; That is our intention, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOsG8b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you intending to take market share from either of those companies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLpi6T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly we want to grow. First of all, we acknowledge we’re a challenger. The market has been pretty ossified, there have been a couple of key leaders for a long time. We think we’re taking a different approach with AI-led innovation, and we think our time is now to be able to grow, and that we’ve taken a big step change in so many parts of the overall experience that it’s a good time for us to be investing a lot in distribution, in marketing, and of course, in the product and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hxb11B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m bringing up the ecosystem because it’s Rick’s job to sell a bunch of phones. Sundar, it’s part of your job to make sure that the Android ecosystem is growing and secure and that all your partners are happy with it. When you’re sitting down with Samsung to talk about Android, are you talking about the Pixel line? How do those conversations go?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOOGw3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; They are our most important partner on Android. I think Samsung is a big partner for our devices and services team as well. There are many components [in this phone] from Samsung to make all of this work as well, so they’re a big partner there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y176tY"&gt;From an Android standpoint, we are very focused for example, on the work we are doing with Samsung on foldables, working hard to make that leap and make it successful; the partnership more recently on the watch, which we have done together with them. So I see Android as one of the more customizable and flexible OSes out there. It gives Samsung and other OEMs the chance to really innovate. And we have Google also doing that. I think some part of it will grow the pie overall. And I think it’s good as a consumer. It’s good we want to put out something unique in the market, and it’s more choice. So I think it’s healthy that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbeIXf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m actually wondering what both of you think about the market specifically with Android. You called it ossified. You are coming in as a challenger. You say you want to grow the pie, but I can’t imagine there’s a lot of new smartphone customers to get. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6VBrz8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m wondering, going forward, what you think you need to do to be successful. You mentioned marketing, I’m wondering what else you might need to focus on to shake up the market like you seem to want to?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAsjCu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think first off is innovation. Our main focus as a company, and especially in our phone products with Pixel, is to try to offer as much help as we can to users across a lot of different arenas. People are very familiar with what Google does with search and Gmail and so many other categories. But we also think we can help people even further with AI as applied to photography, or videos, or speech, or natural language processing, or translation, and on and on. And we can put that together in the best way on Pixel. We also feel like there’s an opportunity to give people great value with a combination of these things. Our Pixel A-series has done a really good job with that to date, I believe, and we intend to continue forward with that. So there are both innovation and value-for-money opportunities in the market, and we hope to offer that for users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DJSbFr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9222414"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XIYv5q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar, any thoughts on what you think the Android market needs these days?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvomev"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I take a slightly longer-term view, and if you look at computing as a whole, there are phones, you have seen hints of people doing stuff beyond their phones as well. There are watches, we’ve done Google TV with Chromecast, Google Home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DudAsk"&gt;To me, this is as much about building a deep capability to innovate in computing for the very long run. Taking that 10, 20-year view. The day-to-day of the current position in high-end phones, I think that’s one snapshot in time, but if I zoom out, that’s what I meant by growing the pie and taking that long-term view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCuB2U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; And if I could add one thing, it would be that we believe that we have a unique portfolio and that it covers a lot of the activity in the home. We recently acquired Fitbit, so we have a nice, robust capability on wearables now that we intend to grow and knit together. Then, of course, the phone is the most important part of people’s computing day-to-day usage. So we believe this unique set of things is the right portfolio to best express where Google can go in the future. We’ve been calling our computing vision for the future ambient computing, and that’s the way we think about it. We want to have people be able to use these devices wherever they are, whatever situation they’re in, whenever they need it, [and] be able to naturally interface with them. Google Assistant is a common interface across all these services. And we think it’s the leading assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1u08OA"&gt;This combination is the right set of technologies for the future of where we feel computing needs to go for users. That is going to be our unique element in this, is the strength in the home, in mobile, and wearables. And we’re excited to start on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mb1qCJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; And hopefully [we] do it in an open way. Hopefully all this computing doesn’t mean you have to be locked into one brand or one OEM. I think some of what Android brings is the ability to have many people plug in and participate. So I’m excited about that as well. And us doing all this also really pushes us hard to make sure different phones can work with different watches, etc., in a way that it doesn’t add complexity for the user and things can be seamless. I think that’s important as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZIXZ9y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I definitely want to talk about Tensor, but you mentioned Fitbit. How’s that going? I know they’re still releasing new products that are on the Fitbit platform. I’m waiting to see if they’re going to be doing hardware on your watch platform. The software story seems a little bit confusing. There’s some Fitbit stuff, but Google Health is still sitting around. So what’s going on with this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na8maq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, they joined our company six or seven months ago now. So it’s pretty early in the integration. James [Park, Fitbit CEO] and team are part of my organization and we’re working really closely together. We’ve consolidated a lot of our health work into the Fitbit organization so that we can really have a focused consumer health approach for wearables and mobile. We announced at Google I/O that we’ll be working on Wear OS in our Fitbit team. So we’re really excited about where that’ll go. No doubt you’ll see them build wearables on Wear OS in the future. So we’re hard at work at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21ZQvU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I asked too soon. We’ll check in on it next year, maybe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpUcWk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. Next year. Let’s talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNnfq7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about Tensor. When did this project start? When did you decide, we’re making our own system on a chip?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lf9rU7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think I started April 16th and it was around the 17th, in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSPhlq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So literally the day you started at Google, you walked in Sundar’s office...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVokHI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; When Sundar and I were talking about starting this organization five years ago, this came up. We felt like it was inevitable that we need to start to invest here. Exactly the form wasn’t clear. But Moore’s Law and general computing laws started to break down around that time and a little bit earlier. So it’s pretty clear, if you wanted to be on the cutting edge of AI innovation, it would have to involve real complete system design. About a year in, 2017, we decided we actually really needed to build an SoC, because you couldn’t just build a single co-processor in order to really harness the full capabilities we needed across a diverse set of AI models and approaches. We discussed this a long time ago. I remember talking to Sundar, letting him know this was going to be a pretty big investment and take a long time. And we didn’t have an organization at that point to build it. So it’s been a long journey. But we’re really excited we’re here. I mean, this is why I came back to Google. Why we wanted to work together on this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLrRTv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve always felt like you have to do deeper work. If you look at our services we’ve built on the consumer side, our data centers, we’ve never shied away from the fastest switches you needed for our networking side, subsea cables. So we have all these TPUs (Tensor processing units). On our data center side, we buy a lot and deeply use Nvidia GPUs and so on. But we have also tried to push the boundary with TPUs custom-built for our AI services. I think it’s important, recognizing that to do well here, particularly if you want to do it well from a AI standpoint, we need to evolve silicon with that focus. I think we had good DNA in thinking on the server side too, here. I think it’s a natural part and I appreciate the long-term focus. I clearly remember our conversation. It’s good to see it all come together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ABtUa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cast yourself back to this conversation. Was it obvious that you wanted to do what you’ve ended up doing or was it a little bit fuzzier? Did you say, “We’re going to need to do some AI chip, we’ll figure it out?” Or were you thinking, “Apple’s got their own chips, we’ve got to have our own chips.” What was that conversation decision process like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlbRx5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It wasn’t 100 percent clear what form our system design work would take in the very early days. It was only after really thinking through what the direction of travel in our various AI research teams was that we realized that we really needed to build the whole thing, simply because of how data moves in and out of our models and how, when we’re doing computational photography, we’re using not just an accelerator, but all parts of the chip to achieve what we need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfQvI9"&gt;There were other elements too, like being able to have a very low power set of the system that could do things when the device was otherwise at sleep. So this combination made us realize we actually really need to build a full applications processor that includes a lot of different heterogeneous sub-components. That was evolutionary thinking. That took a while to fully come to that realization. And we had lots of discussions about it along the way. But it wasn’t one flash of one inspirational moment where that came to us. It was an evolution of thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjwik2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s the old history. I need to ask about more recent history. This morning as we were talking, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snapdragon/status/1448317606365179906"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualcomm decided to say that, “If a company’s making their own SoC that’s a red flag,” on Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Wondering if y’all have anything you’d like to reply to Qualcomm with.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3ovrV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Qualcomm has always been great partners of ours. We’re doing this so that we can work closely with our AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDCn7r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Qualcomm plays a really important role in the Android ecosystem and will continue to [do] so. That’s why I gave the server side example as well. We have done Tensor processing units on the server side, but we deeply use Nvidia GPUs across everything we do too. I think the market has done well overall. I think pushing the high end of silicon across all of us is good. But we are doing this for Pixel, and Qualcomm and others will play an important role in supplying the Android ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROykdX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is a problem across all of Google communicating with customers. It’s a specific problem now with Tensor on the Pixel, of explaining the value of your AI systems, of getting people to understand what they can do, why it’s helpful, and have it be more than just, “it does this specific feature where you can erase something in the background.” I feel like a lot of the time when we talk about AI, it ends up just ending on jazz hands. And it’s supposed to be better. So I’m wondering how you’re thinking about communicating the capabilities that you’ve built for this phone to customers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c667JF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s really difficult to reduce AI to a benchmark or any sort of simplified measure. The way we intend to try to communicate the value to users is through specific experiences that they’re likely to really get excited about. It does make things possible that weren’t possible before. For instance, on Tensor and Pixel 6, the speech recognizer is out of this world. We took a lot of engineering efforts to move our data center quality models, make them run on-device using the TPU. It wasn’t possible before Tensor. And what you get out of it is something that can recognize words at 200 words a minute. I mean, it can go faster than I can think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLbaJq"&gt;And I think it’ll totally change how I use the phone, and I think people will see the same thing. It works across the whole device. That’s an example of how AI will affect everyone’s day-to-day usage of devices. We’ve been doing it for years in other areas, like with screening calls that might be unwanted or in computational photography areas. And we get to apply that more and more to harder problems. So we’ll show users these specific problems that we solve with it and hopefully they’ll find it helpful. Hopefully, they’ll see the benefits of AI overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgjiUm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you’re thinking about what features to launch next, how much are you thinking about potential backlash? I think that with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112807/google-duplex-robot-calls-restaurants-businesses-transparency"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duplex in particular, there was a very strong reaction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; and it took a while for you all to figure out the best way to talk about it and how to get that out into the world. When you’re thinking about new features for the phone or even for Google search or something, how are you thinking about the rollout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdOv8A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; Well, it’s a good question. We now have the experience of many features across our products people use and rely [on]. And they actually walked with their feet. Think about smart compose in Gmail. That’s a new thing to get used to. You have, effectively, AI suggesting phrases to you and stuff. Really, it resonates with users, right? People understand it. I would give a lot of credit to the people using our products. They understand, they are adapting, and they let us know if we get something wrong. I’ve seen [this] across search, across maps. When we do these features well, I think the bar doesn’t change. If it’s an AI feature or not, the bar is still the same; doing something which users find magical and useful. And if so, I think they will adopt it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8HsdY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; A wonderful attribute of Tensor is it enables us to do a lot of these capabilities closer and closer to the user. It keeps them in control. We took great pains to move our data center quality speech model to the phone. It’s running locally on-device. The information stays on the device. A lot of our computational capabilities are done there with our photography experience. And this is a direction of travel for us. We want to strike a great balance between making sure that we’ve got great capability for users and also making sure they’re comfortable with how data is being handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouy8cQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are you balancing adding capabilities to the Pixel specifically? Maybe you’ve got a Pixel feature and then it goes into Android a year later or something? I could imagine a bunch of Android manufacturers would love to have your speech model on their phones. How are you thinking about the stuff that you do? Does it get put into the rest of Android in some way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVkc8T"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a balance that we work on with our platforms and ecosystems team and Hiroshi [Lockheimer]’s organization. But a lot of times Pixel is basically the vanguard of our innovation across the company. We can get it to market through that quickly. And then a lot of it does flow into our ecosystem. Some of it is harder for that to happen, in that a lot of the Pixel 6 innovation, for instance, is driven by new hardware capabilities that haven’t been possible so far. So those might take a while, if ever, to move over to the ecosystem. But in general, we want a lot of this capability available to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XixFLE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Be it Google Assistant or Gboard, the Google keyboard, etc. There are many ways to do it. Over time also, and this is not directly answering your question, but I would say we are taking our speech APIs, computer vision APIs through GCP [Google Cloud Platform], through cloud, and providing to companies as well. So we’re giving it through APIs as well. But it’s a good question. I do think OEMs are interested in accomplishing an experience. I think we work hard to make it possible. So I’ve never seen that be the gating factor. If people have really wanted to make the camera better on their phones and they engage with us, I would say our teams work super hard to make their cameras better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3Vl7y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since we’re talking about Google services on Android, I do need to ask, South Korea recently ruled you need to allow third-party payment systems in Google Play. It seems like you’re going to go along with that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9YdOs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously I think our Google Play team is assessing it and understanding it. I think they are in dialogue with it and we’ll find the right way to comply and make sure we support the ecosystem well. It’s an important ecosystem for us. I do think it’s important to understand Android is different from others. We invest thousands of engineers, build the operating system, which we provide for free. We don’t take a share of the device sales, not a share of the carrier revenues. So in some way we have to sustain our ecosystem. We have a different model. Google Play is an important way. In fact, it’s the main source of revenue. It supports Android as a whole. I think we’ll make that viewpoint clear, but we’ll engage in conversations. I’ll leave it to the team to figure out the right next steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bc7bxC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly, there is also a ruling that your contracts have often not allowed manufacturers to make forks of Android if they want Google services on their Android phones. Do you know what your reaction to that ruling is going to be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hfkwk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;I literally spent so many years in computing. I’ve never seen anything as open as Android. I buy a Peloton, and I discover it’s built on Android. No one from Peloton, I’m sure, ever talked, I don’t know whether they talk[ed] to people at Google. Amazon ships on Android. Obviously, one of the areas where Android gets criticized is at an end user level; the fragmentation as a cost, right? Developers complain of complexity. So, we are constantly striving to create that balance. And as part of that, sometimes there may be feedback from regulators, and I’ve taken the approach that we will understand it. I haven’t seen this as a major issue, but to the extent it is, I think we will address it, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpUyAI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I guess I don’t know what addressing it means.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrDgkU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;It depends on what the specific thing is. I’m just basically pointing out many different ways people work on Android and ship Android. And in fact, there are like, literally, I think if you [count] tablet, all the form factors, all the versions, there are forked versions of Android we ship all the time. So, I do think we are trying to make sure at the end of the day we feel responsible for delivering a user experience on top. There are going to be areas where we are going to have viewpoints. I understand there’s a balance, and we’ll have to figure that out on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pi3aG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To end, let’s talk about one more fun thing. Spending a ton of money, which you all have been doing on Pixel marketing. I have seen billboards. There are TV ads. The thing hasn’t even officially launched yet. You’ve got ads before we know the price. This is a blitz. Is it going to get bigger to try and sell this phone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0iDq19"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, we’re excited about the product and we want to make sure people know about it. We started our marketing early this year, which is a bit unusual. And the reason we did that was it’s a really big change. So we started that effort a couple of months ago and have been building it. You’ll continue to see it build throughout the year. We’re doing a terrific partnership we’re going to announce with the NBA, so we’re very excited about that. That’s just one of many things we’re doing, but you’ll see Pixel is the official phone of the NBA. And we’re very excited about that because I’m a huge basketball fan, so this is a fun topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t58FUC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sundar, did you know this NBA deal happened? I saw you do a double-take.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymip2H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;No, I realized the real thing that drives Rick to work hard on Pixel is so that he gets some courtside seats somewhere for NBA games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvNjV5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about carrier deals? Even with the iPhone, I think that a bunch of the recent success has been coming from getting huge discounts on trade-ins and huge discounts on — they’re not called subsidies anymore, but they might as well be, especially here in the US, where I think you’re really targeting — phone sales are driven by carrier, deals and subsidies. How is your thinking around that going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5e5kN4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; We’re going to be working very closely with carriers. You should expect to see Pixel on all major carriers going forward. In the past, we’ve had distribution with them, but not always the whole portfolio and not across all of them. That’s going to change going forward, and we’ve been talking to all the carriers in the US, and we expect to see that for Pixel 6 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqj2P2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think you’re going to be able to make enough of them to meet demand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDBT9k"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; I hope so. I mean, we’re making a lot more than we have in the past. There is a minor supply chain issue happening in the world. We feel good about where we are right now for this year’s supply. And hopefully that will continue throughout next year, but we’ll see. I mean, we’re small right now, so it’s hard to know if you’ve gotten enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9v9NEB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; There are many areas which we are a small player trying to do better. So we face the same challenges. We are competing against others who have economies of scale, better supply power and so on. And so I think the team has to work extra hard, be it on the go-to-market side, getting carrier deals and making sure people can see the product, or on the other side, making sure we can get supply. And I think those are all the challenges which make it even more exciting, but uncomfortably exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfxREt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a cognitive dissonance when it comes to thinking about Google as a small player. You’re Google, but you’re a very small player in the actual phone market. I think it was four years ago, I asked you when you think the business will be big enough to start breaking it out in your financial results. And you told me five years, so you got a year left. Do you think you’re going to get there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCu8ZZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP:&lt;/strong&gt; I don’t want to make any forward statements from a financial standpoint, but broadly, I want to be clear. We want to build a sustainable business and there are other areas where we are a challenger, right? I think when we try to compete for enterprise contracts, we go up against big Microsoft bundle contracts all the time, trying to convince CIOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCqR5H"&gt;I think there are several aspects of business which have that characteristic and just like we have done with cloud or YouTube, I think to do well in technology, you have to build a sustainable business and they go hand-in-hand, otherwise you can’t. For someone like us, who believes in deep R&amp;amp;D investment, it is even more important to do it well. We are committed, and I take a very long-term view and you’re right, it’s year four or five, but I thought of this in a 10- to 20-year timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFCqRn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was the plan to have this be the hockey stick moment for Pixel? It seems like you’ve been building up to this, and this is the moment when instead of having a little bit of success, you really want this phone to be the thing that launches it as a real competitor with Samsung and Apple?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zkPp9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RO:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s definitely a step change moment for us. We see this as truly the starting line for Pixel, in that we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space. But consumer electronics in general doesn’t usually [grow] like hockey sticks like you would in a web services business. It’s a steady build. And that’s how we’re approaching the next several years, a real steady build. And we’re excited about where it’s headed because what we’re building with Tensor, and with Pixel 6, is how we see the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbvdGu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SP: &lt;/strong&gt;Tensor was a big part of it, so I think a common question I would ask Rick is about Tensor timelines and not where the status of the project is. Part of the reason that I think the team has been more modest in their approach with Pixel over the past 18 months or so is because they’ve been waiting for Tensor to time our investments this way.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYT4Y2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; is Google’s first phone with a custom-designed SoC, and the appeal of the Tensor chip isn’t in raw power, it’s what the combination of hardware and software can do. Speech and image processing that happens on device are great for Google Assistant or improving photographs, but a feature many owners will appreciate at launch is &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/phone-app-updates/"&gt;an improved Phone app that’s built to manage annoying calls to customer service lines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gNLDId5wrMsjhGLKvfOZCCUXlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939435/Dialer_P6_Marketing_Wait_Times.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jdw4RD"&gt;According to Google, the app can tell you the current hold time for a business’s 1-800 number before you even dial, as well as the projected wait times for later in the day or week. These projections are “inferred from call length data that is not linked to user identifier.” Google didn’t get more specific, but it sounds similar to Google Maps monitoring traffic flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HuOtOq"&gt;Direct My Call is a feature built for anyone who has ever forgotten the list of choices by the time an automated message is reading off the third one. It presents the options and their associated numbers right on the screen, so that you don’t have to listen to the entire spiel again just because you were distracted for a moment. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yovcCJ"&gt;Meanwhile, the Google Duplex-powered Hold for Me feature is expanding to Pixel owners in Australia, Canada, and Japan soon. Google will also prompt users to share information about businesses that call using numbers not already in its directory, with the intent to eventually share that information to other people who receive calls from those businesses. That could add some information to businesses that simply use multiple numbers... or give you a heads-up that a bill collector is on the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeLJO9"&gt;It’s not clear whether these features will always be Pixel-exclusive, or if they’ll be available on older Pixel models.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Pixel Stand supports up to 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jO_jzzIrG-FNLvO9ldwBzDr5CW0=/181x0:1260x719/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016546/screenshot.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Pixel Stand wireless charger.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzztjI"&gt;Google revealed a new second-generation Pixel Stand wireless charger on Tuesday. The new charger offers charging speeds of up to 23W with “compatible Pixel phones” and up to 15W with other Qi-certified devices. To keep the stand cool while it’s charging at those higher speeds, the new Pixel Stand has a “nearly silent built-in fan,” which could be similar to the fans inside recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;chargers&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t used the stand ourselves, though, so we’ll have to wait and see if the fan is as quiet as Google claims it will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03ia0t"&gt;Like Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;first Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the second-generation version is designed to let your phone sit in portrait mode. That could make it easier to keep up with texts and notifications as they come in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPPvhL"&gt;The new Pixel Stand will cost $79, though the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;charger’s Google Store page&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t give a specific release date. You can’t order it yet, though Google says it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJ03U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22497573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="lkwHn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are officially here&lt;/a&gt;, and with them, the debut of Google’s new Tensor chip. Google has finally revealed more information on what the new SoC can actually do, for the fastest Pixel phones ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tFw24"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;initial reveal&lt;/a&gt; of the Pixel 6 and the Tensor chip was largely centered on its AI-focused TPU (Tensor processing unit) and how the custom hardware would help Google differentiate itself from competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjpSJ9"&gt;That’s still the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/"&gt;big focus of Google’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; today: the company calls Tensor a “milestone for machine learning” that was co-designed alongside Google Research to allow it to easily translate AI and machine learning advances into actual consumer products. For example, Google says that the Tensor chip will have “the most accurate Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)” that it’s offered, for both quick Google Assistant queries and longer audio tasks like live captions or the Recorder app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ry5Dmf"&gt;Tensor also enables new Pixel 6 features like Motion Mode, more accurate face detection, and live translations that can convert text to a different language as quickly as you can type it. Google also says that the Tensor chip will handle dedicated machine learning tasks with far more power efficiency than previous Pixel phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpvg7L"&gt;But there’s a lot more to a smartphone chip than its AI chops, and with the reveal of the Pixel 6, we finally have more details on the &lt;em&gt;rest &lt;/em&gt;of the chip, including the CPU, GPU, modem, and the major components that make Tensor tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lTFKze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPA2FORP_FDIJPtCcyA4M3rZw44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939258/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.10.47_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Joi0va"&gt;As rumored, the Tensor chip uses a unique combination of CPU cores. There’s the custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI, two high-power Cortex-X1 cores, two midrange (rumored to be older Cortex-A76 cores), and then four low power efficiency cores (likely Arm’s usual Cortex-55 designs). Graphics are offered by a 20-core GPU, in addition to a context hub that powers ambient experiences like the always-on display, a private computer core, and a new Titan M2 chip for security. There’s also a dedicated image processing core to help with the Pixel’s hallmark photography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rIv2O"&gt;It’s not entirely clear why Google would choose to use the Cortex-A76 cores instead of the more modern Cortex-A78 (which are both more powerful and more power efficient). But it is worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://nanoreview.net/en/soc/qualcomm-snapdragon-765g"&gt;Pixel 5’s Snapdragon 765G&lt;/a&gt; also used two Cortex-A76 cores for its main CPU cores, so it’s possible Google is sticking with what it knows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r6VEpDSX5ZyjsCkTpKEst72BmF8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939331/Screen_Shot_2021_10_19_at_1.25.43_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S6Ce3G"&gt;The new phones should still be the fastest Pixel phones yet, with Google promising 80 percent faster CPU performance compared to the Pixel 5, and 370 percent faster GPU performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2I9uV"&gt;The real question, though, is how the Pixel 6 and its Tensor chip hold up compared to other traditional Android flagships. Google’s CPU configuration is a unique one, compared to the more traditional four high-performance and four efficiency cores used by major Qualcomm and Samsung chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nHipu"&gt;In theory, Google is offering double the number of X1 performance cores — the most powerful Arm design — than the Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100, which both use a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1, three Cortex-A78, and four Cortex-A55&lt;/a&gt; cores. But Google is also swapping out the two high-end cores with midrange ones, which may help battery life and performance... or may just result in a weaker overall device. We’ll find out soon once we’ve had the chance to put the Pixel 6 and Tensor through their paces. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 is now available for Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google Pixel running Android 12" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rAlVt-rNjyvS47ulzWJjSnahSbQ=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016203/android12hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEtPXJ"&gt;The final version of Android 12 has been available to developers and eager fans for a few weeks on AOSP, but today, it officially launched for people who want to easily pick up the update over the air. It’s available to install right now on Pixel 3 and up, including the Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, the Pixel 5, and the Pixel 5A. It’ll launch on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, as well. Android 12 will be coming later this year to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKAdZA"&gt;The most noticeable feature in Android 12 is the new Material You design, which lets you go a little deeper to tweak the look of the homescreen to your liking. It’s more expressive than previous versions of Android, with tools to let you coordinate colors that can extend across app icons, pull-down menus, widgets, and more. Speaking of widgets, many of those have been updated to match the new look, and Google shared today that by the end of October, it plans to have over a dozen new or refreshed widgets available for its first-party apps.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 running on Pixel 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RJxL1Hdpwnwi6X74iXuiib8rr_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938464/pixelandroid12.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at some of the new widgets made for Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uk9I0L"&gt;There are plenty of other features in Android 12, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;you can read more about them in my review of the software&lt;/a&gt;. Google also &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/android-12/"&gt;published a blog&lt;/a&gt; that goes deep on the features you’ll be able to experience. But if you’re mainly interested in Material You, you should know that Google says it’s a “Pixel-first” feature, though it will be coming to “more device makers and phones soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EghAY"&gt;It’s likely that Pixel phones will receive several more “Pixel-first” features in the future with Android 12. For the past couple of years, Google has released feature drops that make it a little sweeter to be a Pixel user. Some of the features only work on newer Pixel phones, though, so that’s all the more reason to consider picking up the new Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro. Google shared during its hardware event that these phones will get a minimum of five years of support, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRFxm0"&gt;To get the update, head to your Pixel phone’s settings app, click “System,” then find “System update” and click into it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro finally bring new camera hardware in addition to software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VtgRIH-mWfqkyKBFGA8viHnuWSQ=/0x1364:4500x4364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70016201/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear bar of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro house new cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cpOfKf"&gt;Today at its Pixel Fall Launch event, after many pre-announcements and leaks, Google finally announced all the details of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Some of the biggest changes to these new flagship phones from Google are updated camera modules. Pixel phones were long the champions of smartphone photography, but Google has been resting on its laurels for a while, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;using the same 12.2-megapixel Sony IMX363 sensor&lt;/a&gt; from Pixel 3 through Pixels 5 and 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sb47Nq"&gt;Now, the main cameras of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro house a 50-megapixel sensor that is larger than its predecessors and bins the images down to a 12.5-megapixel output. Google claims it can capture 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5. Following the iPhone playbook, both Pixels feature ultrawide lenses with 12-megapixel sensors while the 6 Pro adds a third, telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom coupled to 48 megapixels of resolution. On the front, the Pixel 6’s selfie cam is 8 megapixels with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro is 11.1 megapixels and 94 degrees for easier group selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzfLbX"&gt;The rear camera setup is quite the departure from prior Pixels, where the commodity hardware of Pixel cameras allowed Google to focus squarely on software optimization. Some Pixel iterations added or removed an extra lens or two, but each relied mostly on computational features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYtdsp"&gt;Those software developments have brought new features to the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro as well. Google claims its reengineered Portrait Mode can better render different skin tones of wider, more diverse groups of people, naming the feature Real Tone. Google coordinated with photographers and cinematographers of color to build more diverse portraits into the image dataset of its camera models. Google says it went to the lengths of even correcting some aberrations that affect the image rendering of those with darker skin more harshly, such as implementing a new algorithm to decrease stray light, which washes out dark skin. Google says it is dedicated to building a more equitable experience across its camera and imaging products, which will hopefully be a welcome departure from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/12/16882408/google-racist-gorillas-photo-recognition-algorithm-ai"&gt;past omissions in its algorithms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SyOyMzbsWgYYPVZ7tZaTmOFe4Ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22939444/34_real_tone_improvements.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Real Tone improvements to its Pixel cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xDB55D"&gt;What Google calls Face Unblur promises to use the multiple images recorded with each shutter press to keep faces sharp, even when photographing movement. It begins this process before a picture is taken, by preparing the second camera to shoot with a faster shutter speed once it sees a blurry face in the frame. It then matches the pixels and combines the images for sharper faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwP0XR"&gt;Motion Mode is designed for capturing action shots and long exposures, for aesthetics like streaking car lights across a nightscape or panning with a moving subject to blur the background and give a sense of speed. Google is using machine learning to detect the content of the frame and blur a background behind a subject in motion as they move, or to keep everything sharp as you hold still and just key elements will blur. It is once again using multiple shutter speeds from the different camera modules and combining the images. Google showed off examples of a waterfall blurring into silky wisps and a subway train blurring behind a static person on the platform. All of these are shots that conventionally require a tripod or other specialized photographic equipment, though Google is promising you can do this handheld with the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VR8CgFsIs7CEXGf7-1i2o5yuFX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22938901/Magic_Eraser.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Eraser can automatically remove unwanted subjects from backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hVmodH"&gt;Lastly, Magic Eraser will attempt to remove distracting objects and photo bombers in Google Photos. After a picture is taken, Google Photos may make suggestions to automatically remove undesirable subjects from the image. Also, users can review the shot and select distracting objects in the frame to be removed. Aside from photobombers, other examples given by Google were location scouting and removing obtrusive content from a background or foreground for a cleaned look. Since it is baked into Google Photos for the Pixel, Google says the eraser tool can be used on photos taken now or photos from years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKOQZz"&gt;Magic Eraser sounds a bit like the long-abandoned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/17/15654476/google-photos-object-removal-feature-demo"&gt;chain-link fence concept&lt;/a&gt;, now resurrected in a more achievable form. Google showed off automatic object removal at Google I/O 2017, six months before the Pixel 2 came out, but it never made it to a device. It was seemingly forgotten and quietly left behind by Google. Though it has since been a case study for Google’s software-first mentality, it looks like a version of it is alive now in the Pixel 6 and Google Photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HV4UY"&gt;Google also partnered with Snap to create Quick Tap to Snap in the Pixel 6. Double-tap the back of the phone to go directly into Snapchat’s camera app. Google will get exclusive AR filters and transitions from Snap. This partnership with may indicate a stronger attention to Android from SnapChat, which has historically had a subpar experience for non-iOS users. Now Snap will get native support of the Google camera app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrZ97Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22497573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pixel 6 event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel Pass bundles Google’s phone and services into one monthly subscription  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="diXM3S"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/?_ga=2.14465783.1972768495.1634663243-1405963905.1634663243"&gt;Pixel Pass&lt;/a&gt; is a new subscription bundle designed to let US customers pay for a Pixel phone in monthly installments while also getting access to Google’s premium subscription services like 200GB of Google One cloud storage, YouTube Premium, YouTube Music Premium, and Google Play Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43CY8A"&gt;Prices start at $45 a month for Pixel 6 or $55 for a Pixel 6 Pro, and Google says they’re available unlocked and should work with all major carriers. Pixel Pass subscribers are eligible for an upgrade after two years, Google says, and the subscription also includes an extra year of warranty coverage over the standard one-year manufacturer warranty (aka &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518?hl=en-GB"&gt;Preferred Care&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ESzROO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting at $45 a month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="19uNXU"&gt;Pixel Pass, which is being announced today alongside the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22495075"&gt;new Pixel 6 phones&lt;/a&gt;, appears to combine elements of Apple’s iPhone Upgrade Program (which lets customers pay for an iPhone via monthly payments and offers an extended warranty), as well as its separate Apple One services bundle. Apple One currently includes subscriptions to Apple Music, Apple TV Plus, Apple Arcade, Apple News Plus, Apple Fitness Plus, and iCloud. However, a key difference is that Pixel Pass only offers an upgrade after two years, while Apple offers an upgrade after just one to users on its upgrade program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuPmHu"&gt;Google says if subscribers cancel before the two years are up, they’ll have to pay off the remaining value of the Pixel device early at its regular “non-discounted price” and will also lose access to the bundled services. Upgrading your device at the end of the two-year period may change the price you’re paying, the company cautions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ3P31"&gt;Google says its Pixel Pass subscription is available via Google Fi, as well as the Google Store. Google Fi subscribers can save an additional $5 off their monthly Fi plan with a Pixel Pass subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are freshly announced, and they’re already up for preorder. The new Pixels promise to offer the latest from Google, including new designs, new cameras, a new and uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two flavors: the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro. The base Pixel 6 with 128GB of storage starts at a price of $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google has already kicked off its preorders on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers and carriers are coming online shortly. We will update this post as more options become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have big screens, big ambitions, and small prices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google claims to finally be ready to take on Apple and Samsung&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TCOahY"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;many leaks&lt;/a&gt;, official teases, and months of waiting, Google has finally given its latest Pixel phones a formal launch. The new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are the latest high-end phones from the company that hasn’t traditionally been able to make much of a dent in the high-end phone market. Both are available for preorder starting today, October 19th, and will begin shipping on October 28th. Google says all the major US carriers, plus retailers such as the Google Store, Best Buy, Amazon, Walmart, Costco, and others, will be selling the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIFGEC"&gt;There are a lot of things to cover with the new Pixels, but the most important place to start is this: $599 and $899. Those are the starting prices for the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, respectively. That pricing is aggressive compared to similar iPhones, Samsungs, or even OnePlus phones, especially when you consider that Google is providing 128GB of storage in both base models. (The 6 can be equipped with up to 256GB, the 6 Pro has options up to 512GB.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpTmvm"&gt;Aggressive pricing has long been a Pixel &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;, and though the new Pixel 6 and 6 Pro represent a new push from Google to make phones that are competitive with the best from Apple and Samsung, these prices are just lower than the competition. A big draw for a lot of people might be that, at the end of the day, the Pixels just cost less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUbJxf38TEYXXa1KB0-HKkD7i6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934843/cwelch_211015_4802_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the Pixel 6 Pro (left) and the Pixel 6 are large phones — Google isn’t offering small and large options this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UfOfNy"&gt;The other big thing to note with the Pixels is their new processor, a custom-designed ARM SoC (System on a Chip) that Google is calling Tensor. Google says it’s competitive with the Snapdragon 888 from Qualcomm, which is what you find in basically every other high-end Android phone available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHplBf"&gt;There’s a lot going on with this processor. The most important piece is that there’s a custom TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for AI built right into the chip and many main processing pipelines. In addition, there are two high-power application cores, two mid-range cores, four low-power cores, a dedicated coprocessor for security, a private compute core, and an image processing core. The Pixel 6 pairs the new chip with 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro has 12GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vjG5Ci"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a lot going on with Google’s new Tensor processor&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cXG8bQ"&gt;Visually, the new phones are a departure from prior Pixel phones. Though they share a common design language, that language doesn’t really connect back to the Pixel 5 or the Pixel 4 that came before. Instead, these are flashier, shinier phones, with polished metal frames (on the 6 Pro) and glossy glass backs (on both). Google is offering each phone in three different colors, but the 6 Pro’s are decidedly more “professional” (read: boring), while the regular Pixel 6 colors are clearly more fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5bLu7"&gt;I haven’t really been able to put a finger on how I feel about the new designs, but there’s something undeniably generic about them. Take the G logo off the back, and these could be phones from Samsung, TCL, OnePlus, Oppo, or any one of a number of other Chinese OEMs. Prior Pixel phones often were criticized for having a plain look that bordered on reference designs, but they all had a Google-y aesthetic to them. I’m not sure these new models have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmRQgK"&gt;By the way, Google’s rules for reviewers and influencers dictate that today, we can write about hardware impressions and specs but not provide any details on software, performance, or image quality. It’s meant to provide a sort of hands-on experience — rest assured, we will have much more to say in the full review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z46T4ahUo1sPcJNtmim9zl7Noig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934864/bfarsace_211014_4802_0117.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera module is the most prominent part of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a new standard wide camera and new ultra wide camera in both phones; the Pixel 6 Pro adds a 4x telephoto camera to the mix.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbtPK1"&gt;The most prominent feature on the 6 and 6 Pro is the back camera housing. I call it a ledge; you might call it a shelf; Google seems to refer to it as a “bar,” but it’s an enormous protuberance that spans the entire width of the phone and houses two (Pixel 6) or three (6 Pro) cameras and related sensors in it. The bar is large, but unlike camera housings located in the upper corner, like you get on an iPhone or Samsung, it doesn’t cause the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro to rock when placed down. A case will likely help mitigate the size, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPMn1T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A camera upgrade years in the making&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDafJ"&gt;That back camera housing is so prominent because, as usual with Pixel phones, the camera is one of the most important parts of these new models. Google has finally switched to a new camera sensor after using the prior one for four straight generations. Both phones have a 50-megapixel main sensor that is hard coded to output 12.5-megapixel images. It’s a much larger sensor than Google’s used before — physically larger than even the iPhone 13 Pro’s new camera sensor — comes with 1.2μm pixels, and is behind an f/1.85 aperture optically stabilized lens. Google says it captures 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5’s camera. Next to it is a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera with a 114-degree field of view, f/2.2 lens and similarly large 1.25μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsVTtt"&gt;If you spring for the Pixel 6 Pro, you also get a 4x telephoto camera that’s not available on the standard Pixel 6. This uses folded optics, has 48-megapixels (also binned down to 12-megapixel output), and has an f/3.5 aperture lens. 4x is slightly longer reach than you get with the iPhone 13 Pro’s 3x tele but not nearly as far as the 10x lens that Samsung has been putting on its high-end phones (not to mention the even longer lenses companies like Xiaomi and Huawei have deployed recently).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNnlCY"&gt;The front cameras differ between the models, too, with the Pixel 6 getting an 8-megapixel, 84-degree field of view and the 6 Pro using an 11.1-megapixel, 94-degree camera. That translates into you’ll be able to fit more people in a selfie with the 6 Pro than you can with the 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awL99E"&gt;The new processor enables some new image editing features, like a “magic eraser” tool that gets rid of distracting elements in your images automatically and new long-exposure and motion blur capture modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX8iLW"&gt;For video, both phones can shoot up to 4K 60fps, now complete with Google’s auto HDR image processing, or capture up to 240fps slow-mo video at 1080p. While Google has generally excelled at still image capture, it has long been behind Apple in video capture — we’ll be seeing just how far it’s come and if it’s more competitive now when we review the phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHl6jRq1h1U8Rsi2ktVZD-U71Kc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934844/cwelch_211015_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 has a 90Hz, 1080p, 6.4-inch OLED screen (left); the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch, 120Hz, 1440p OLED with LTPO.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqvN2U"&gt;Turning to the front of the devices, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have large, OLED displays. The 6’s screen measures 6.4 inches diagonally, has 1080p wide resolution, and can refresh at 90Hz for a smoother scrolling experience. It’s a flat panel and has slightly larger bezels all around than the 6 Pro, which utilizes curved sides on its 6.7-inch, 1440p screen to minimize the bezels. The 6 Pro also uses LTPO technology to vary its refresh rate from as low a 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz, depending on what you’re doing on the phone. Both phones’ displays are covered in the latest Gorilla Glass Victus glass and support HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPEjNj"&gt;The screens are bright and look good, though if you turn them off-axis, you can see noticeable color shift, and there’s a visible shadow in the 6 Pro’s curves. Those are things we don’t see in the best screens from Apple and Samsung at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1YAfnl3T0GOFnK8ksZlW-HFD40=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22936585/cwelch_211015_4802_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve on the Pixel 6 Pro produces a noticeable shadow on light backgrounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXcqe"&gt;As you can probably guess from those screen sizes, both of these phones are big. Unlike prior years where Google provided a small and a big option, there’s no real small phone in this lineup. In fact, the Pixel 6 is effectively as big as an iPhone 13 Pro Max; the 6 Pro is even larger, though its curves help mask its large footprint somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCEWce"&gt;Between the two, the 6 Pro certainly feels more “premium.” Its aluminum sides are thinner and polished to a shine; the regular 6 has thicker, matte sides. And there are more rough edges to find: there’s a different radius curve for the camera bar than the rest of the phone and inconsistencies with the clickiness of the buttons in the units we’ve been able to handle so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jsbNa6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There aren’t any major feature omissions this time around — a rarity for Pixel phones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6Wk2c"&gt;Rounding out the hardware features are the things you’d expect to find on a premium phone in late 2021. Both have wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging for accessories), IP68 weather resistance ratings, in-screen optical fingerprint sensors, stereo speakers, and fast charging support. But you won’t get a charger in the box — you’ll have to either buy a 30W brick separately or use something you already have to take advantage of that last feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZfnWZ"&gt;Both phones also support 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity, though only the 6 Pro and a special version of the 6 for Verizon (which costs $100 more) have millimeter wave support. Batteries are large in both models, as well: 4614mAh in the 6 and 5004mAh in the 6 Pro. We won’t know for sure until we’re able to fully review them, but the concerns of Pixel phones coming with underequipped batteries seem to be fully in the past at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m07WNB"&gt;Lastly, the Pixel 6 Pro also has an ultrawideband chip, similar to recent iPhone and Galaxy models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro color options are a bit boring.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBIkzqa8G4XMu3yO_gP0NDAn7qY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934836/bfarsace_211014_4802_0044.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s more fun in the regular Pixel 6 color options (a basic black and grey one is also available).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0L0coA"&gt;As you’d expect from a Pixel, the new models ship with the latest version of Android — in this case, Android 12. We’ve already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;gone in depth on Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro add a few new features that leverage their custom processors, such as faster on-device translation and those new AI-powered image editing features mentioned above. Importantly, Google says the new phones will get a minimum of five years of software support, longer than any other Pixel before and longer than virtually any other Android phone you can buy now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GCCDXt"&gt;Google really wants us to know that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are a turning point for the company. In an interview ahead of the announcement, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said “this is truly the starting line for Pixel, in that, we’ve brought together all the elements that we think we need to be a real player in this space.” We can’t tell yet whether Google will finally be a “real player” in the smartphone world with its Pixel phones, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro do look like its best effort yet. Stay tuned for our full review in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
