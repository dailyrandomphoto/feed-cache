    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Test-launching its astronaut capsule a second time, Boeing needs a success now more than ever&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gDspJf"&gt;Boeing, once a major player in space, has suffered a string of setbacks, failures, and legal challenges in recent years that have chipped away its dominance in the space industry. The company’s space unit has been lapped by Elon Musk’s SpaceX and left to watch on the sidelines as other companies have moved ahead with ambitious programs, from sending astronauts to the International Space Station to returning humans to the surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oynrNe"&gt;On Friday, Boeing will try to mend its reputation during an uncrewed test of its Starliner astronaut capsule to the ISS. This will be the second launch for the capsule, coming a year and a half after its first attempt failed to reach the space station. Eighteen months of grueling technical investigations and a string of leadership shake-ups has brought Boeing back to the launch pad for a $410 million do-over that would put it on track for its first launch with humans aboard later this year. SpaceX, Boeing’s rival in NASA’s Commercial Crew program, is far ahead, with three astronaut missions already under its belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixid9T"&gt;The company has seen its once-close relationship with the space agency dwindle since the beginning of its Starliner program. Focusing more on SpaceX, NASA officials overlooked Boeing’s software problems that led to Starliner’s failure. Two investigations, one related to potential fraud in its Starliner program and a criminal probe into Boeing’s bid on a lunar lander contract, pushed the company’s reputation in deeper trouble, locking Boeing out of the first major contracts in NASA’s Artemis program. For Boeing, another Starliner failure is not an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0vC6RD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s of paramount importance that we have a successful flight”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hss9cy"&gt;“It’s of paramount importance that we have a successful flight,” John Vollmer, Boeing’s Starliner chief, said last week. “This is a serious and unforgiving business, so we take it very seriously... All that we’ve done in the past 18 months, we are very confident that we are going to have a good flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUH4M3"&gt;The CST-100 Starliner capsule, a gumdrop-shaped astronaut pod designed to carry cargo and up to seven passengers, will launch without humans on Friday at 2:53PM ET. It’ll carry out the motions of a routine mission: launch to space, dock to the ISS for ten days, then come home — blazing through Earth’s atmosphere at first, then floating under parachutes the rest of the way down to a desert in New Mexico. The mission, called Orbital Flight Test-2, is one of the last tests Boeing needs to nail before its final test, flying a crew of NASA astronauts. Once Starliner wins its NASA certification like SpaceX’s Crew Dragon did last year, up to six operational missions to the ISS for the agency follow. Both companies developed their capsules under the NASA program, with Boeing’s Starliner contract at $4.5 billion and SpaceX’s at $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fM5a2i"&gt;Starliner’s 2019 failure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Xm7mQd"&gt;Boeing was banking on success ahead of Starliner’s first orbital test in December 2019. At the time, the company was entrenched in its 737 Max crisis. A clean launch would “restore the Boeing brand,” then-Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told senior NASA officials at Kennedy Space Center hours before liftoff, according to people familiar with the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DC1oZo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Starliner success would “restore the Boeing brand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2yCJ6"&gt;But Starliner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;failed&lt;/a&gt;, and Boeing’s board ousted Muilenburg days later. The capsule didn’t reach the ISS and instead returned to New Mexico just two days after launch. Thirty minutes after liftoff, when Starliner was supposed to enter orbit, a series of software failures led the capsule to think it was in a vastly different phase of its mission, causing its suite of onboard thrusters to fire haphazardly, expending crucial amounts of fuel. An unexpected communications blackout prevented mission control from fixing the spacecraft remotely. Once Boeing got Starliner in a shallow orbit, it decided to send the capsule home early. Hours before Starliner was due to reenter, engineers scrambled to patch another software glitch that would have caused the capsule’s service module — the bottom portion that ejects before reentry — to crash into the capsule itself. Once “catastrophic spacecraft failure” was averted — as NASA safety adviser Paul Hill would describe it months later — Starliner landed safely in the New Mexico desert.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boeing’s Starliner capsule landed safely back on Earth after a hectic two-day mission in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aZHsH9"&gt;NASA and Boeing convened an independent team of veteran engineers to investigate the causes of Starliner’s failures, eventually recommending 80 different fixes — 61 to Boeing’s software and 19 to the capsule’s communications system. Boeing and NASA agreed to a test redo since Starliner never demonstrated its ability to dock to the station. “That’s the part of the flight that, to me, is so critical,” NASA’s Commercial Crew Program manager Steve Stich told reporters on Tuesday. The redo and “several performance items” for Starliner cost Boeing at least $410 million, Greg Smith, the company’s then-chief financial officer, said in an earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWJuzM"&gt;Boeing has since overhauled the way it tests and validates its software, both on Starliner and across some of its other NASA programs, like its Space Launch System rocket. Starliner’s communications system was upgraded and Boeing hired a new software VP from SpaceX, Jinnah Hosein. Months before Friday’s mission, the company had simulated a full test mission for the first time, from launch to ISS docking to landing — something it didn’t do prior to Starliner’s first mission. That’s on top of “hundreds of hundreds” of other simulations totaling “literally thousands of hours,” Vollmer told reporters on Tuesday. All 80 corrections recommended by the independent Boeing-NASA team have been made, which involved a “relatively small set” of flight software changes, Vollmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Triua"&gt;Though Starliner is back at its launch site, Boeing’s relationship with NASA has taken lasting hits. NASA has shifted toward leaner, cheaper contracting models intended to make the agency a customer — not an owner — of spacecraft developed by companies mainly with their own funds. Boeing, a publicly traded aerospace giant, is accustomed to the opposite: building hardware that NASA will exclusively own under larger development contracts that come with incentives for the contractor.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ux9zw4"&gt;Boeing’s waning relationship with NASA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lWvU1h"&gt;With the private, fixed-price model of its Starliner contract, Boeing bears more responsibility and risk than it is used to. Its work on such programs has been cited in financial filings as “inherently risky” that “subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues.” With SpaceX’s Crew Dragon far ahead in operations, and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin fiercely competing for more lunar lander funds, Boeing is struggling to adapt to mounting competition from the billionaire-backed space companies. NASA, too, has struggled under this commercial shift. The agency, under political pressure to end its reliance on Russia’s space program for rides to the space station, has also faced pressure from Boeing to bend the rules of its fixed-price Starliner contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FwndUN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$661 million in Boeing deals probed for fraud&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ARWRfg"&gt;In 2019, $661 million worth of Boeing deals with NASA were investigated for fraud by the agency’s inspector general 2019, according to documents obtained from a Freedom of Information Act request. That investigation, previously unreported, focused on two deals that, taken together, raised concerns among auditors of procurement fraud as Boeing was on the verge of canceling its Starliner contract. One involved a $287 million boost to Boeing’s Starliner contract in late 2016, and another involving Boeing’s sale of $374 million worth of Russian Soyuz seats to NASA two months later in 2017. The investigation sheds some light on an early instance where Boeing’s relationship with NASA began to strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5LlRO"&gt;For the Starliner deal in late 2016, Boeing asked NASA to raise the value of its fixed-price Starliner contract after running into months of development delays that Boeing itself caused. As fixed-price contracts typically require the contractor to bear the cost of falling behind, not the agency, several NASA attorneys initially objected to Boeing’s proposal over fears it would violate the contract, according to a partially redacted document NASA refused to release until &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;filed a FOIA appeal. But Boeing, according to four people with first-hand knowledge of the private discussions, threatened to drop out of the Commercial Crew Program if NASA didn’t agree to the contract boost (Boeing denied this in 2019, issuing a &lt;a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-18-Boeing-Statement-Regarding-OIG-Report-on-NASAs-Commercial-Crew-Program"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that said “any implication that we ever wavered in our participation in Commercial Crew is false). NASA ultimately agreed to the $287 million boost, justifying its payment by citing fears that recent rocket failures with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/1/12748752/spacex-launch-site-explosion-cape-canaveral-florida"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13806300/russia-roscosmos-spacecraft-international-space-station-mission"&gt;Russia’s Soyuz rocket&lt;/a&gt; would jeopardize the agency’s ability to send astronauts to the ISS in the next two years. In exchange, Boeing agreed to speed up the time it’d take to build Starliner capsules for crewed missions it said would occur as early as 2019. Boeing has yet to fly humans under the program.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next to two cosmonauts, NASA astronaut Andrew Feustel launches to the ISS in March 2018 in a Russian Soyuz seat that NASA paid Boeing $81 million for, records show, as part of a rare $374 million deal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wrZPrY"&gt;Around the same time, Boeing entered settlement talks in an unrelated lawsuit with Russian rocket firm Energia, where it would obtain the rights to five astronaut seats on Russia’s Soyuz launch vehicle. Boeing offered to sell those seats to NASA for $374 million five days after the agency agreed to the $287 million Starliner boost. NASA ended up buying the seats from Boeing to solve the same schedule issue Boeing’s Starliner commitment was supposed to solve. Highly unusual, it marked the first time NASA bought Russian astronaut seats from a non-Russian entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rmwrk9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Less-than-optimal contract administration”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evzWql"&gt;Two years later, auditors with NASA’s inspector general examined the Starliner and Soyuz deals and referred their findings to the inspector general’s investigative unit for a fraud probe, according to a case memo. Investigators within that unit closed the case, finding that auditors’ concerns about the deals were “valid” but “less-than-optimal contract administration did not equate to fraud.” Boeing and NASA have defended the deals. When it was first reported in a &lt;a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-20-005.pdf"&gt;public audit&lt;/a&gt;, Boeing said it was taking on “significantly more upfront financial risk and is already helping NASA with critical decisions” on the space station, and that without getting the extra $287 million, the original contract structure would have “increased cost and schedule uncertainty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7glqdE"&gt;Boeing ran into more problems in 2020 when it sought to compete for a contract in NASA’s multimillion-dollar lunar lander program. The company was removed from the competition and became &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-boeing-exclusive/exclusive-boeing-to-face-independent-ethics-probe-over-lunar-lander-bid-document-idUSKBN2603F2"&gt;the target of a Justice Department investigation&lt;/a&gt; when its senior vice president for space and launch, Jim Chilton, discussed Boeing’s bid with NASA’s then-human exploration chief Doug Loverro. The conversation occurred while the agency was reviewing company proposals — a strict “blackout” period where agency contact with bidders is highly restricted. Loverro resigned, and Boeing &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-boeing-exclusive/exclusive-boeing-to-face-independent-ethics-probe-over-lunar-lander-bid-document-idUSKBN2603F2"&gt;reached an agreement with NASA&lt;/a&gt; that forced the company to carry out a private review of its ethics culture. Boeing fired an in-house attorney and a few employees.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jim Chilton, Boeing’s senior vice president of space and launch (left), speaks to reporters in December 2019 about problems with Starliner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hCVUDH"&gt;The investigations into Boeing’s Starliner deal and its role in NASA’s lunar lander competition stained the company’s space program. While space might not be a strong source of revenue for Boeing, participating in off-world missions is a source of company pride that boosts its brand and paves a path to future space ventures, including space tourism. “Allowing private citizens to experience the wonder of spaceflight is part of our future plans for Starliner,” Boeing spokesman Josh Barrett said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZloSaP"&gt;A successful Starliner mission would be a heavily needed win for Boeing after years of technical and management struggles. The company, though, still has a lot to learn about the spacecraft, and Friday’s flight is vital for its plans. “There are systems on this vehicle that we need to fully understand how they operate in the environment of space,” Vollmer said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="moEWgm"&gt;“Will there be some learning? There absolutely will be some learning. It’s a test flight.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Valve’s Gabe Newell explain why the Steam Deck exists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJewW7lWAlkAHzIWezvHsPFDeNA=/535x0:2416x1254/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645831/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_10.16.10_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQzIhN"&gt;Valve president Gabe Newell has &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kO6Dj2XNfY"&gt;given a rare interview&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, where he talks about why the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;upcoming Steam Deck handheld&lt;/a&gt; exists and the philosophy the company had when designing it. The interview is worth a watch to see Newell and developer Pierre-Loup Griffais discuss the motivation behind creating an “open” device (with Newell mentioning that you could hook up an Oculus Quest to it if you wanted), along with what discussions inside Valve led to the system’s development. &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; also &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-openness-superpower-closed-platforms-gabe-newell"&gt;has a write-up summarizing the interview&lt;/a&gt; if you’d rather read than watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOXzzh"&gt;Newell also discusses the obvious comparison between the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch, saying Valve has chosen different trade-offs when creating its portable gaming system. The interview covers more topics, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/22/22244057/valve-gabe-newell-half-life-new-zealand-game-development"&gt;the future of work at Valve&lt;/a&gt;, Newell’s interest in medical research, and how the company is trying to avoid &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;the stock problems that have plagued consoles&lt;/a&gt; like the PS5, Xbox Series X, and Switch. Of course, it wouldn’t be an interview with Gabe Newell if he wasn’t asked a question about &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;, which he answers by saying that “[&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;’s ending] feels like the right progression for where we’re going with &lt;em&gt;Half-Life&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ugCx7i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“[Half-Life: Alyx’s ending] feels like the right progression for where we’re going with Half-Life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="srBSOh"&gt;For those interested in Valve and the Steam Deck, this interview is well worth a watch. To paraphrase Newell talking about the Steam Deck: you’ll know if it's for you pretty quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to get rid of that irritating Meet tab in Gmail for Android and iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kElamayrognHUrlrAaydiKbTUWU=/26x0:1190x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67190053/google_meet_poup.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DaSkVR"&gt;I have nothing against Google’s Meet videoconferencing platform — in fact, I’ve used it a few times — but I can’t help being annoyed when the feature is pushed at me via other apps. Specifically, Gmail. Meet first appeared on the desktop Gmail app in the spring of 2020, but it did not take up much space and was reasonably easy to ignore (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598038/how-to-google-meet-gmail-hide"&gt;remove from your screen&lt;/a&gt;, if you so wished).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gUOJcZ"&gt;A few months later, however, Meet made its way onto the mobile Gmail app via two tabs at the bottom of the screen: one labeled “Mail” and one labeled “Meet.” The problem here isn’t only that you’re being pushed to use a particular videoconferencing app while all you want to do is check your email, but it also takes up space, expanding the bottom margin of the app and giving you approximately three fewer lines to work with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail with the new bottom-screen tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-XYtUnsnTj5HuA8a2U5Lfz46PaM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728441/Screenshot_20200811_163146.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail with the new bottom-screen tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gmail without the new bottom-screen tabs." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1em3NLHjIltFZrClTIAuhYPqQXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728442/Screenshot_20200811_163734.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gmail without the new bottom-screen tabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14k2AS"&gt;If you plan to use Meet regularly, you may not mind. But if you don’t and you want to get rid of the excess tabs, here’s how you do it. These instructions apply to the Gmail app on both Android and iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZUu4az"&gt;Select the three-line “hamburger” icon in the upper left corner, scroll down, and tap on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TGx5lA"&gt;Select the Gmail account you want to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jPcxtE"&gt;Scroll down to the “Meet” category and uncheck “Show the Meet tab for video calling.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to your Gmail settings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EslLROXK2WTkcqTv6H3urORTsrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21728454/Screenshot_20200811_163945.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to your Gmail settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile’s new prepaid offer is a direct play for the Boost customers it sold to Dish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZrffFC9Q_1SR134a9mRQi1GNxBw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645783/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile is offering customers who switch from an MVNO a discount on an unlimited Metro plan with 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPbUJx"&gt;T-Mobile is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Fswitch-to-metro-by-t-mobile-get-a-free-5g-phone&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22598163%2Ft-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;introducing a new prepaid promotion&lt;/a&gt; with incentives for customers on other prepaid MVNOs to switch to Metro by T-Mobile, including waiving switching fees, a discount on an unlimited plan with 5G, and a trade-in offer for a new 5G phone. In other words, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"&gt;it’s doing exactly what it told regulators it wouldn’t do&lt;/a&gt; when it acquired Sprint a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883y0L"&gt;The US wireless market is lousy with 5G phone trade-in offers and 5G plan upgrades these days, but this one stands out in its direct pitch to lure Boost Mobile customers to T-Mobile’s prepaid brand — the same customers it was ordered to sell to Dish network with the intention of setting the company up as a fourth wireless carrier to replace Sprint. It’s also what Dish warned might be coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;in a plea to the Federal Communications Commission earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AJZy7t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many Boost customers need a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vdm8eb"&gt;The promotion also appears to specifically appeal to Boost customers on Sprint’s old CDMA network — a network T-Mobile owns and operates and announced it would be shutting down on an unusually aggressive timeline. This leaves many Boost customers in need of a device upgrade by January 1st, 2022, which T-Mobile is happily offering to facilitate if they switch to Metro:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlQkHS"&gt;“Get half off your unlimited line when you switch from Boost or Cricket by bringing your phone number to Metro by T-Mobile and trading in ANY working device for a limited time. Yes, any — even that old flip phone!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NC1pwS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PJpm4H"&gt;The deal provides customers who switch and trade in a phone with a two-year discounted $25-per-month price on an unlimited plan with 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZjE2R"&gt;T-Mobile’s track record of keeping its Sprint merger promises is shaky at best. It has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"&gt;failed to create jobs it said it would&lt;/a&gt;, and while it has technically fulfilled its requirements to Dish Network, like selling Boost and providing wholesale network service, it hasn’t exactly been helpful either. This new promotion is perhaps its most obvious play yet to win back Boost customers — the very customers Dish will need to retain if it’s going to becoming a full-fledged carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google will require employees to be vaccinated before returning to offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QrMIKehNGPibzS95YFWgbhv4r08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645736/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4D5TFx"&gt;Google will require that employees be vaccinated before they’re allowed to return to the company’s offices, CEO Sundar Pichai announced today in a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/28/business/google-return-to-office-masks.html"&gt;letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9Fc6x"&gt;The announcement marks Google as one of the first major technology companies to require that employees be vaccinated before they return to work. The news comes as part of a new wave of vaccination requirements this week, spurred by the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/27/biden-vaccine-mandate-federal-employees/"&gt;reportedly planning to announce a requirement&lt;/a&gt; for federal workers to either be vaccinated or face frequent testing for COVID-19 sometime on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlp7JB"&gt;Google’s vaccination requirement will reportedly apply to workers at US offices “in the coming weeks” and to other regions “in the coming months,” per the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wuddng"&gt;Additionally, Google will be delaying its official return to offices from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175150/google-return-office-september-flexible-work-week-coronavirus-pandemic-sundar-pichai"&gt;sometime in September&lt;/a&gt; to October 18th, as the Delta variant of COVID-19 continues to spike across the United States. It joins Apple, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584761/apple-return-to-office-delayed-covid-delta-variant"&gt;which also postponed&lt;/a&gt; the end of its remote working policy to “October at the earliest” over similar COVID concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine’s protection against severe disease holds steady over six months</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Virus Outbreak Palestine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GrpDD2pIQ1PqWanv6Y_41MvsgSs=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645588/1234236839.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kVihci"&gt;The Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine’s protection against severe cases of the disease holds steady after six months, according to &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.07.28.21261159v1.full.pdf"&gt;new data&lt;/a&gt; released by the companies. But its ability to protect people from developing any symptoms of the disease dropped over time, the analysis showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHWM7e"&gt;The data could add to the debate around if and when people may need booster doses of the vaccines, which the &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/24/politics/biden-team-next-steps-on-covid/index.html"&gt;Biden administration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/07/08/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-vaccine-boosters.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, and other experts have been deliberating on for the past few months. The issue became more pressing when cases of COVID-19 in the United States started to surge as the Delta variant spread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPJqwr"&gt;Overall, the vaccine was 91 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 over six months. It was the most protective in the stretch starting seven days after the second dose and running for two months: in that window, it was 96 percent effective. Its&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;efficacy then dropped around 6 percent every two months — to 90 percent between months two and four after vaccination, and to around 84 percent between months four and six after vaccination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WupUoV"&gt;There wasn’t a similar drop in efficacy against severe cases of COVID-19 — &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/137926/download"&gt;defined&lt;/a&gt; as cases where blood oxygen levels drop below 93 percent and heart and respiratory rate are elevated. The vaccine’s efficacy against those severe cases stayed high at 97 percent for the entire six-month stretch after people got their shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpmZmV"&gt;The data was published as a preprint by Pfizer and has not been reviewed by outside scientists. It was released on the day of the company’s earnings call, where it also released &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/28/health/pfizer-third-dose-data-bn/index.html"&gt;internal data&lt;/a&gt; showing that a third dose of the vaccine could boost levels of antibodies against the Delta variant of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EaAo4"&gt;The findings came from the study that started last summer to test the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;first set of findings&lt;/a&gt; from that study were the results the Food and Drug Administration used to authorize the shot. The companies continued to follow the more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;42,000 participants in that study to check how the vaccine performed over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsFiq6"&gt;The analysis also found no new safety concerns in people who had been vaccinated for six months. The company will continue to follow participants for two years after they received the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5Z3pk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>James Bond’s iconic Aston Martin DB5 is coming to Rocket League for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eUfteDturL_q5QqhmYZFMp0sKl8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645507/aston_martin_db5_rocket_league.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nKrrKe"&gt;Would you pay $10 for the privilege of strapping rocket boosters to James Bond’s iconic Aston Martin DB5 automobile and using it to score spectacular gravity-defying goals with a giant ball? &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; is officially making that possible from Thursday, July 29th through August 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqoLEe"&gt;Epic Games developer Psyonix says it’s signed a multiyear deal with MGM and Aston Martin to bring 007 to the vehicular sporting game — starting, of course, with the ‘60s classic made famous by &lt;em&gt;Goldfinger&lt;/em&gt; but still stealing scenes as recently as &lt;em&gt;Skyfall &lt;/em&gt;and the upcoming &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Y4uUUp"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tTkJQh1_yQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kfeOVc"&gt;Will I buy it, though? Nah — because aside from the teaser atop this post, there doesn’t seem to be much Bond about &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s version other than the DB5’s historic association with the franchise. I wasn’t expecting &lt;em&gt;ejector seats&lt;/em&gt;, but Psyonix candidly tells me it won’t have any of the gadgety animations that might set Bond’s version apart. Turning the snazzy secret auto-rotating license plates into a simple door for the rocket engine? I suppose that’s something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zP0pGv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10673155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvHszi"&gt;I’ll probably save that money toward &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cfLlO7wnwGQ"&gt;Lego’s gadget-filled DB5 model&lt;/a&gt;, while I wax nostalgic over &lt;a href="https://photos.google.com/u/1/share/AF1QipPyNibA6GWN90FKru9hLpkgm841a3yi_tblBLxQMXaKbLnStZfJDwWZ6KunTyPt2A?key=ZEc1ajV6d3lXZmRKT2Jlek04OGxhWjhXczE0cjJR"&gt;these photos I took of real Bond cars&lt;/a&gt; at the London Film Museum. I captioned some of those pics &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/my-afternoon-with-james-bonds-amazing-spy-vehicles-1729067561"&gt;for &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you like, though my post there has &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; a few more embedded ads than the last time I saw it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWNvhi"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; DB5 will cost 1,100 credits, or roughly $10. It will come with “007’s Aston Martin DB5 Paint Finish (which resembles the signature Silver Birch color of the Aston Martin), Aston Martin DB5 Engine Audio, Aston Martin DB5 Wheels, and a Reel Life Decal,” according to a press release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oppo Watch 2 launches in China with a promise of 16 days of battery life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOnWiY7jO6LA755kSxuz0Y6ZyrM=/167x0:1526x906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69645503/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.38.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N0llrH"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oppo.com%2Fcn%2Faccessories%2Foppo-watch-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F28%2F22597727%2Foppo-watch-2-china-announcement-qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oppo Watch 2&lt;/a&gt; has launched in China, featuring the same Apple Watch-style design as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"&gt;original Oppo Watch&lt;/a&gt; but with improved internal hardware. That includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 4100 platform&lt;/a&gt; and a promise of up to 16 days of battery life from a single charge while using a low-power mode (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/28/oppo-watch-2-launches-in-china/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3Zd4lp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Oppo Watch isn’t bad, but it does look like an Apple Watch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267264/oppo-watch-hands-on-preview-smartwatch-china-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CaLCTd"&gt;As was the case for the Chinese model of the original Oppo Watch, the Oppo Watch 2 runs Oppo’s Android-based ColorOS, not Google’s WearOS. Last year’s model was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349246/oppo-watch-global-release-wear-os-india-uk-price-date"&gt;released outside of China&lt;/a&gt; with WearOS and access to the Google Play Store, but Oppo has yet to announce any plans for a broader release at this time. It’s also possible that the company is waiting for Google and Samsung’s upcoming WearOS 3.0 collaboration to arrive later on, seeing as it seems like it’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588440/google-wear-os-3-update-smartwatch-samsung-2022"&gt;difficult to update already released products&lt;/a&gt; to the new operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jrgZlCG05gLl9eOQLnEbFMI9ZYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746021/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.38.04_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l8oK7U"&gt;The Oppo Watch 2 will come in 42mm and 46mm sizes, featuring a curved OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and 326ppi. Both models will also feature an optional eSIM, in addition to heart rate, sleep, and blood oxygen monitoring. And the smaller 42mm size will also offer a Bluetooth-only mode, for those who don’t want or need LTE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wMi1X"&gt;But the most impressive spec on the upcoming smartwatch appears to be the 16-day battery life, although it comes with the caveat of requiring Oppo’s Power Saver mode. In regular use, the Watch 2 can last up to four days on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPU18"&gt;Preorders for the Oppo Watch 2 are already available in China, with shipping set for August 6th. Pricing starts at ¥1,300 (approximately $200) for the entry-level 42mm Bluetooth model,  ¥1,500 (approximately $231) for the LTE-enabled 42mm model, and ¥2,000 (approximately $308) for the 46mm model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard faces lawsuit and employee backlash over sexual harassment</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;California’s suit alleges a toxic culture, discrimination, and retaliation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gmgRi2"&gt;Female employees of Activision Blizzard faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination based on their gender, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;a lawsuit filed against the company&lt;/a&gt; by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;Some of the claims in the suit&lt;/a&gt; are disturbing enough to require a content warning. Activision Blizzard’s initial official response called the state’s descriptions “distorted, and in many cases false,” though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591611/activision-blizzard-brack-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-california"&gt;one of Blizzard’s executives&lt;/a&gt; has called them “extremely troubling” and Activision Blizzard’s CEO later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;called the company’s first response “tone deaf.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMSnVd"&gt;In response to Activision Blizzard’s denials, what’s estimated to be almost a third of the company’s employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;signed an open letter&lt;/a&gt; calling for Activision Blizzard’s leaders to take accountability, with many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;planning a walkout on July 28th&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;pledged to remove “inappropriate references”&lt;/a&gt; from its MMO &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; but hasn’t specified what those references are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaA27m"&gt;The case, along with employee’s response to it, could end up being an important moment for the video game industry, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332534/ubisoft-serge-hascoet-harassment-sexism-racism-metoo"&gt;long struggled&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21307560/gaming-abuse-harassment-systemic-ubisoft-chris-avellone"&gt;mistreatment of female and minority employees&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees say CEO’s letter ‘fails to address’ key concerns</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXvj0e"&gt;In a new letter, Activision Blizzard employees said that CEO Bobby Kotick’s note addressing allegations of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination at the company “fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.” Last week, California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;filed a huge lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt; bringing the allegations to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcPsHU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594882/activision-blizzard-employees-open-letter-management-california-sexual-harrassment-lawsuit"&gt;Staff slammed the company’s initial response to the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, and in Wednesday’s response, the employees said they are pleased to see that they have “convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications.” But employees point out that Kotick’s letter does not address some key areas of concern, including ending forced arbitration for all employees and the need for greater pay transparency. We have published the employees’ full response at the end of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvyjQb"&gt;Employees are set to walk out in response to the company’s handling of the allegations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;at 1PM ET / 10AM PT.&lt;/a&gt; Activision Blizzard leadership informed employees Tuesday that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;they won’t receive repercussions for attending&lt;/a&gt; and will receive paid time off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FgF13Y"&gt;Here is the employees’ response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FB3xuI"&gt;On the evening before our employee walkout, Activision Blizzard leadership released a statement apologizing for their harmful responses to last week’s DFEH lawsuit. While we are pleased to see that our collective voices — including an open letter with thousands of signatures from current employees — have convinced leadership to change the tone of their communications, this response fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Activision Blizzard’s response did not address the following:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The end of forced arbitration for all employees.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worker participation in oversight of hiring and promotion policies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The need for greater pay transparency to ensure equality. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employee selection of a third party to audit HR and other company processes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today’s walkout will demonstrate that this is not a one-time event that our leaders can ignore. We will not return to silence; we will not be placated by the same processes that led us to this point.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the beginning of an enduring movement in favor of better labor conditions for all employees, especially women, in particular women of color and transgender women, nonbinary people, and other marginalized groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We expect a prompt response and a commitment to action from leadership on the points enumerated above, and look forward to maintaining a constructive dialogue on how to build a better Activision Blizzard for all employees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, we stand up for change. Tomorrow and beyond, we will be the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
