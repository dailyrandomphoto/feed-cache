    <title>Go watch this stunning FPV drone short film inside a bustling bowling alley</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3q42_K0HFUttn0bZiZZCx4hGyRM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936907/GIF_Bowling.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sW1NO"&gt;It’s been a while since most of us have been able to go to a bowling alley, but “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgS54fqKxf0"&gt;Right Up Our Alley&lt;/a&gt;” is a new drone video that might just be the next best thing, thanks to an astonishing display of camera work and drone piloting skill, &lt;a href="https://kottke.org/21/03/a-drones-eye-view-of-a-bowling-alley"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Kottke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJoVQW"&gt;The video, from YouTuber jaybyrdfilms, doesn’t provide too many details, other than it was shot at &lt;a href="https://www.bryantlakebowl.com/"&gt;Bryant Lake Bowl&lt;/a&gt; in Minneapolis, and it was filmed with an FPV drone. But the footage speaks for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQRqGC"&gt;At first, it gives off the impression of a standard drone flight, with a bird’s-eye view of the building itself. But things quickly shift as the pilot meticulously swoops the drone &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the open door of the bowling alley, maneuvering past diners and waiting bowlers before swooping down the alley itself alongside a spinning bowling ball. Throughout the short clip, the pilot manages to fly the drone back behind the pin setting machines, down a narrow corridor of tools and parts, behind the bar, and even into the pins for a perfect strike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LMFWf"&gt;Selling the short film is perfectly dubbed dialogue from bowlers, customers, and the ambient noise from the alley itself, which gives the illusion of actually soaring around the alley as snippets of conversation float by. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKB9Ge"&gt;Aspiring pilots might want to just enjoy this one from a distance. Unless you’re an expert drone pilot yourself, though, you might not want to risk a new $1,299 DJI FPV drone to re-create the film in your own local bowling alley. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus surpasses 100 million subscribers </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flT-MzE9aU7iWNz0qfxP0L-Ud3Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936883/wandavision.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AIoj03"&gt;Disney Plus has officially surpassed 100 million subscribers, less than a year and a half after the streaming service launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcJgO2"&gt;Executives announced the milestone during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/disney"&gt;Disney’s&lt;/a&gt; annual shareholders meeting. The last time Disney gave an update on Disney Plus’ subscribers number was in February during its first quarter earnings, when it announced that as of January 2nd, 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;there were just over 94 million&lt;/a&gt;. Although executives didn’t say what pushed Disney Plus over 100 million subscribers, the recent success of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303068/wandavision-episode-8-explainer-recap-scarlet-witch-white-vision-post-credits"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon &lt;/em&gt;likely helped. The next big series for Disney Plus is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;out on March 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM1yMq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;/em&gt;The enormous success of Disney Plus ... has inspired us to be even more ambitious, and to significantly increase our investment in the development of high-quality content,” CEO Bob Chapek said in a press release. “In fact, we set a target of [more than] 100 new titles per year, and this includes Disney Animation, Disney Live Action, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="00mtKI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrAUFg"&gt;Disney’s streaming success has caught the attention of everyone in the industry. Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/21/netflix-ceo-reed-hastings-praises-disney-plus-execution.html"&gt;didn’t think it was possible&lt;/a&gt; that Disney could generate 60 million subscribers for Disney Plus within its first year, and now it has passed 100 million subscribers within 16 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0OaIZ"&gt;Disney executives originally predicted that Disney Plus would amass between 60 and 90 million subscribers by 2024. The company has blown past that goal and is now targeting between 300 and 350 million subscribers across &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-surpasses-137-million-paid-subscriptions-across-its-direct-to-consumer-services-shattering-previous-guidance-increases-paid-subscriptions-target-to-300-350-million-by/"&gt;all of its streaming platforms&lt;/a&gt; (Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus, Star Plus, HotStar) by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sju4z"&gt;To try to continue growing Disney Plus’ subscriber base, Chapek reiterated that Disney’s “direct-to-consumer business is the company’s top priority, and our robust pipeline of content will continue to fuel its growth.” There are currently several series from every major franchise and brand in development, and it seems likely more mid-tier films (movies that aren’t on the same level as Star Wars, Marvel, or &lt;em&gt;Frozen&lt;/em&gt;) will migrate to Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HsNhQd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8t5dvp"&gt;While 100 million subscribers is an accomplishment, analysts will likely have questions about the revenue breakdown. In December, Christine McCarthy, Disney’s chief financial officer, announced that 30 percent of Disney Plus’ subscriber base comes from Disney Plus HotStar, where the average revenue per customer is lower. As Netflix’s vice president of investor relations, Spencer Wang, pointed out in January, the overall revenue is lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvNuf3"&gt;Still, there’s no question that Disney has pulled off an incredible feat with Disney Plus. Other competitors, like WarnerMedia and NBCUniversal, are trying to scale their own streaming services (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, respectively) but are growing at a much slower pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV6ewx"&gt;During the meeting, Disney executive chairman Bob Iger reiterated that he was going to leave the company at the end of the year. This mark’s his final shareholder meeting. Considering he saw the conception and launch of Disney Plus, he’s stayed at the company longer than planned to see it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojgc29"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yakuza’s lead writer on how Like a Dragon reinvents the series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZQeFdP2F1eFpUP71DODGbOGuUs=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936708/ss_08_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A long, spoiler-filled chat&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2LMMT4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is a bold shift for Sega’s long-running series, doing away with beloved protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and shifting to turn-based RPG-style combat. In Kiryu’s place is the wild-haired Ichiban Kasuga, who finds himself homeless in Yokohama after doing 18 years’ hard time for a murder he didn’t commit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukVo4U"&gt;The PlayStation 5 version of &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; was just released last week, a few months after the PS4, Xbox One, PC, and next-gen Xbox versions. Since then, I’ve played several dozens of hours of &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; on the Xbox Series X, and it’s become one of my favorite games in the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEdhGs"&gt;I took the opportunity to ask Masayoshi Yokoyama, Sega’s chief producer and writer on the game, some questions about how the team approached Kasuga as a character and his story from beginning to end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nbkxN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Warning — there are some pretty heavy &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spoilers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; toward the end of this interview.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgMeYD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, I’d like to ask about Kasuga himself. How involved were you with the character creation process? What were the principles for the character you kept in mind when writing for him?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKmYA3"&gt;Basically, I have been in charge of the character settings (such as personalities, speech mannerisms, and the backbone of their action principles) for the main characters that appear in the main story since the first game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0fDt4"&gt;The character, Ichiban Kasuga, was originally born during the development of &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku Online&lt;/em&gt;, which is a mobile app title being serviced in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQMYTI"&gt;At the time, we just finished the development of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt; and were ideating on a new protagonist to take Kiryu’s place. That’s when we decided on taking apart the indestructible hero image and creating a more “real-world hero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="61FM3c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Yakuza: Like a Dragon is a fresh next-gen start for the series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJrvLL"&gt;Kazuma Kiryu’s personality is representative of characters that appear in “Ninkyo” films, which is a genre of Japanese mafia films that have been around from back in the day. He is generally reserved, stoic, and self-sacrificing, but stronger than anybody and prefers to act alone. In a way, his character embodies qualities that Japanese boys and men would look up to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFWbdw"&gt;Kasuga, on the other hand, was created with the intention of being more “relatable” rather than “admired.” I wanted to create a character whose words and actions would emotionally move us, and someone that you’d want to cheer for and fight alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6gCBY"&gt;Since the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku Online&lt;/em&gt; was a card battle game in which players form decks with their friends to fight against enemies, I wanted to depict the strength of a “leader” rather than the strength of an “individual,” which became the origin of my idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rNkfz"&gt;After that, I compiled all of Ichiban Kasuga’s origin and life story into a document and presented to executive director [Toshihiro] Nagoshi and my team members. This led to talks of potentially using this character for the next console game and then eventually became official for &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NWWVd8tmsz0POlfU7CukUqM8T8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356288/Yokoyama_san_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masayoshi Yokoyama of Sega’s Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KDiJ4Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Was there a conscious effort to make him different to Kiryu? What do you think the two characters have in common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJkS0V"&gt;For those that have played both &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, you may have noticed that Kazuma Kiryu and Ichiban Kasuga lead a similar path. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZXwGK"&gt;Both had a difficult childhood without the love of their immediate family, then felt extreme gratitude and admiration for the ones that took care of them. Unable to suppress these emotions, both set out on the path of yakuza. Right when they’re about to become full-fledged yakuza, they both go to prison for a crime neither committed. What awaited them after their long sentence was an unimaginably cruel reality… This general flow is exactly the same for both of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAe1E2"&gt;However, just because the two characters’ personalities differ so much, the same general plotline gives off a totally different feel for both. Upon release from prison, Kiryu goes straight to find his mentor Kazama. While Kasuga also tries to find his mentor, Arakawa, before he sets out to do so, he decides to clean himself a bit first and stops by the hair salon to get a botched perm. Both characters follow the same path, but vastly differ in their portrayal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1FVW0"&gt;I actually haven’t had too much difficulty depicting each of the characters. For &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, I set out to write the story after fleshing out Ichiban Kasuga as a human being, so while writing, I even surprised myself at times how different these characters acted within very similar circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3I73Zg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which came first: the idea to make Kasuga an RPG obsessive, or the decision to shift &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to RPG-style turn-based combat?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ac5e8D"&gt;The decision to shift to RPG came first. The character setting that Kasuga loves RPGs came after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9GGAe"&gt;As previously mentioned above, the concept was “to create a new relatable hero,” so we chose the most optimal game system (a party system) that would make Ichiban Kasuga’s story interesting. We wouldn’t have made the same decision for Kiryu, who fights with only his own power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOfM7l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Where to start with the Yakuza series","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22255880/yakuza-series-xbox-game-pass-where-to-start"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ahJopZ"&gt;One of my beliefs in creating games is to “value the core of play.” This involves deciding what the game is supposed to entertain, and then assigning the various components to the right places accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOldbE"&gt;The story is the core element of the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. This game was made to enjoy the story, and the other elements such as the city used as the setting, music, mini-games, and battle action are all there to elevate the story experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PaXkx"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, the most optimal way for players to experience the story and show the battles of Ichiban Kasuga and his friends that gathered around him was the RPG style. So, upon deciding the RPG genre, there were then a few questions that we had to address, such as: How will we make Kasuga relate to the “hero” job class? What is the logic behind the exchanges during these battles within Kasuga’s mind? One way we addressed these was to make Kasuga an RPG enthusiast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/90zkc62TLDzEzhfu5DX5gM-wgUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356330/ss_04_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="waaAEJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The character’s personalities are often expressed in their combat moves — was there discussion between the writing and gameplay teams on specific abilities that would be funny or appropriate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrcXzV"&gt;Here at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, there isn’t much of a clear distinction between the writing and game design teams. I started out in what we call in Japan as a “planning position” (game designer), and I’m now kind of like the boss of the whole planning team [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. All the other writers on the team are selected from among the current planning staff based on their writing skills and put on different projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rCYD0"&gt;Basically, the game designing and narrative writing are not compartmentalized, so our planning crew meetings always have the mini-game designers, battle action staff, and writers in attendance. Even the voice recording is supervised by the person in charge of each part of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP3K1l"&gt;That’s the overall gist of things, so even for anything minor, we discuss and make decisions as a whole team. Ideas are always flowing, but since we value the energy and momentum over the precision of an idea, so we do end up axing a lot of them [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoQw0n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I don’t know if this is the same for everyone, but &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; took me a lot longer to finish than other games in the series. This is probably because of the slower-paced combat, but did the longer running time affect your approach to story writing and pacing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8A9Pl"&gt;The volume and length of the story is actually not that different from the past games in the series. So, it didn’t affect the story writing and pacing all that much. We look to the general volume of a 10-episode Japanese drama series when creating the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFjygJ"&gt;For this game, I think the reason for the longer playtime was because of the shift to RPG, requiring more time to level up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bo6nc2"&gt;The accelerating the battle tempo was something we worked on until the very end of development. We also continued to make adjustments to the time it takes to level up, but the game is designed so it will become difficult to beat the stronger bosses unless you change jobs and collect materials for better weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IL9dv0"&gt;For those players that are playing this game in the same way you played through the past ones, it might feel a bit longer, but we went with this kind of balancing because we wanted players to discover the fun sights of the city while leveling up their party, instead of simply grinding to level up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g04fmh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; series has a really unique blend of serious and light-hearted subject matter. How do you balance those aspects when writing and make sure everything feels appropriate for the series?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjjgbu"&gt;As touched upon earlier, I think the greatest strength of our team is that the narrative, game design, character design, animation, and sound creation staff all have a deep understanding of what the “core” is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is0hS5"&gt;The reason for this isn’t simply how long we’ve known each other or how well we get along. I think that each and every staff member loves &lt;em&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;) and I think that’s the biggest reason. I personally am in charge of story writing and also am the chief producer and have a hand in ideating and executing on some marketing and PR initiatives, but every decision I make is based on how to reflect the content of the game in any kind of promotion or campaign, and how to make the game itself more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELnG3S"&gt;All staff members that are involved with the game, including those working within the game and outside of the game, such as the sales team, advertising team, and marketing team, are working hard to increase the produce value of the game, so everyone’s accumulated effort is maybe what creates this great balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nbN0K"&gt;In a past game, someone on the advertising team even wrote and implemented an original story scenario for a real company that appeared in Kamurocho that he was the point person for [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;], so as you can kind of see what kind of team Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecbqs5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the first &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game where you’re accompanied by a party of characters for almost the entire running time, and they all have their own motivations. Was that a challenge compared to previous &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games, where the focus tends to be on the current protagonist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o6chM0"&gt;In the past, when creating games like &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, which depicted the past of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, and other remake titles, I would dig deeper into the characters other than the protagonist, so this wasn’t so much of a challenge for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9gNkUOvNnrfrDX_t_JLdfCQqxaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356331/ss_07_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="az507x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think Arakawa is probably the most pivotal character in the game. The intro does a good job of making him a sympathetic character before setting him up as the villain, and then he’s revealed to have been on the Tojo Clan’s side all along, before meeting a tragic end. How early on in the writing process was his role decided, and was he always intended to have an arc that spanned most of the game’s story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tk5T8C"&gt;This was something that was decided at the start of writing the first chapter. When creating the intro scene of the game, my determination was that “I’m going to depict the life of this man, Masumi Arakawa,” so the game started out on that scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx4fNX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Han Joon-gi twist was particularly unexpected for me given how he died in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. What was the thought behind (sort of) bringing him back as Kim Yeonsu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JfdV5D"&gt;This was actually something that was decided around the time I started thinking of Ichiban Kasuga’s story. There wasn’t too much deliberation behind this decision, but my personal thought was that if the Jingweon Mafia were to make an appearance, then Han Joon-gi has to be there, too. In addition, I feel like the Jingweon Mafia would do something like that. Sorry for surprising you [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jlLFBT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Of course, the biggest reveal of the game is the return of Kiryu, although his role is quite minor. Were you planning from the beginning to include him in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, considering how &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; seemingly drew a line under his storyline? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHManE"&gt;This wasn’t decided in the early stages of planning the story. When the main themes of the game were decided to be about the dualities of the front and back — the hypocrisy and justice, the superficiality and the truth of Japanese society — I thought it was impossible not to have him appear in the episode of the underworld, so we decided that he would make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWnjMx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have the same question for Goro Majima, who seems to appear in every &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; game to varying degrees now. In &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he’s a difficult boss fight but doesn’t otherwise have a big role in the story — how did you approach his inclusion?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqiVh2"&gt;The reason why we decided that he’d make an appearance is the same as for Kazuma Kiryu. However, the big difference is that we cut all ties to the past. This game is unwaveringly seen from Ichiban Kasuga’s perspective, so we got rid of any information or connections that Kasuga has no need of knowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmUxm0"&gt;This is the beginning of the tale of Ichiban Kasuga, and not a continuation of the Kazuma Kiryu story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stSJ4z"&gt;We wanted those players that started the series with &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; to have the same amount of knowledge and emotions as Kasuga when interacting with Majima and other characters from the past series, so we didn’t include any unnecessarily deep interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joMqWDqDlV0T2CQRaD9QmANHjs0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356332/ss_02_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nAUzRo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m sure you can’t say anything specific about potential future games, but I thought it was interesting how &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Like A Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; finished on an open-ended note, with Kasuga deciding his friends are what’s most important to him. Is there a direction you’d like to take the character in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kR7qMP"&gt;I think that &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is only the first chapter of Ichiba Kasuga’s life. Since he was in prison for 18 years, he has only just begun his life as an adult man. I’m sure there’s probably many trials and tribulations that await him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez246P"&gt;Even Kazuma Kiryu, who was said to be the strongest, had his life turned upside down with his encounter with a little girl. As Kasuga starts out his new life, he will surely encounter challenges that he cannot solve through violence or brute force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9mtaZj"&gt;I develop each game with the intention of creating a life of a single person. I’m not sure if I’ll continue to write Ichiban Kasuga’s life or not, but I can totally imagine him in deep trouble somewhere on the face of this Earth [&lt;em&gt;laughs&lt;/em&gt;]. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google links Android phones to Chromebooks with new Phone Hub feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtVbpSlFwJvTAKl95CB_OlZBbc0=/0x0:1686x1124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936690/PhoneHub.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Phone Hub feature in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qU9Hs0"&gt;Google is marking 10 years of Chromebooks by unveiling new features for Chrome OS today. The biggest addition is a new Phone Hub feature that connects an Android phone to a Chromebook. It allows Chrome OS users to respond to texts, check a phone’s battery life, enable its Wi-Fi hotspot, and locate a device easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhMf9B"&gt;Phone Hub is packed into a taskbar widget that even expands to show you recent Chrome tabs that you have been browsing on your phone. It looks like it will be a super useful feature for Android and Chromebook owners. Google is also enabling its Wi-Fi Sync feature on more devices, allowing you to connect to Wi-Fi networks you’ve already configured and used on your Android phone and other Chrome OS devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wyd9637fcuhcT5cUNdmwx0GgdRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357091/Nearby_Share.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS gets an AirDrop competitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7gXiT"&gt;Another significant addition to Chrome OS is Nearby Share between Chromebooks and other Android and Chrome OS devices. Much like AirDrop, Nearby Share will let people send and receive files between devices. Google says this will arrive in Chrome OS in the coming months, finally providing its laptop OS with a full AirDrop competitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESABWk"&gt;Elsewhere, Google is also adding in a new Screen Capture tool into the Quick Settings menu in Chrome OS. Like the name implies, this will let you record your screen or take screenshots and access them quickly in a “Tote” space from the Chrome OS Shelf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md0_MxcinOWJhtqD2ZhZVTrsGrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357085/Screen_Capture.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Screen Capture in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bKkI6zBujcHNbONNUEOV-NPhuc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357087/New_updates_for_Desks.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virtual desktops improvements in Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbgfBY"&gt;The Clipboard is also being improved in Chrome OS, allowing you to save five recent items to paste elsewhere without switching windows. The Launcher Key will provide access to this updated clipboard experience. Quick Answers is another new addition, which lets you right-click a word in Chrome OS to get a definition, translation, or unit conversion. It’s very similar to what exists in macOS today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SosV2E"&gt;Google is even improving the virtual desktops feature of Chrome OS — Desks. When you reboot a Chromebook, it will now restore all windows to their correct virtual desktops, and you can also right-click at the top of an open window to send apps to a different virtual desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSqy1RbZdlTuV8JE2T_t7r6bBcI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357088/Clipboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome OS’s clipboard feature is getting a history feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5vgH4n"&gt;Most of these new Chrome OS additions are clearly playing catch-up to what already exists on Windows and macOS, but they’re welcome additions for those relying on Chrome OS every day. Google first launched a range of Chromebooks back in 2011 in a partnership with Samsung and Acer. There are now Chromebooks from every major PC maker, and Google is promising that 50 new Chromebooks will launch during 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s first tweet may fetch $2.5 million, and he’ll donate the NFTy proceeds to charity</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Victor Boyko/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2UWlw"&gt;Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581"&gt;now plans to convert the proceeds&lt;/a&gt; from the NFT auction of his first tweet to bitcoin and donate them to charity. The highest bid for the tweet is currently $2.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q12Fl5"&gt;The auction will end on March 21st, and he plans to donate the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/"&gt;Give Directly&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit that lets donors send money directly to people living in poverty. He’ll be giving the bitcoin to &lt;a href="https://www.givedirectly.org/covid-19/africa/"&gt;Give Directly’s Africa Response fund for COVID-19 relief&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SLJwGI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ending this March 21st&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will immediately convert proceeds to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And send to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GiveDirectly?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GiveDirectly&lt;/a&gt; Africa Response&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1369326373035245581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPKJb"&gt;Dorsey put up his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/20"&gt;famous first tweet&lt;/a&gt; as an NFT (which stands for “non-fungible token”) on Friday evening, and bids quickly poured in, even though Dorsey hadn’t announced when the auction would end or that proceeds would be going to charity. The current highest bid was made Saturday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="S6izmA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIW5lq"&gt;The winner will get a “digital certificate of the tweet,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kBx-HXY8ow_7bElsJZ6Sk3r2V9cQjSRdWFyKCUXZtAs/edit"&gt;according to an FAQ on NFT auction site Valuables&lt;/a&gt;, where Dorsey’s tweet is for sale. However, the tweet will remain viewable on the internet for free, assuming that Twitter or Dorsey himself won’t remove it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch may be adding a ‘brand safety score’ for streamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bws8TspabzjbzxK2XyzL9vHFM7Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68936085/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Cybersecurity researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS"&gt;Daylam Tayari&lt;/a&gt; has found evidence in Twitch’s internal API that the site plans to implement something called a “brand safety score” for its streamers. That score would depend on a number of criteria: the streamer’s age, a rating given by Twitch staff, their ban history, the relationship the streamer has with Twitch, their automod settings, their partnership status, the ESRB rating of the game being played, and whether the stream is set to mature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rCsvgd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitch has added an automatic Brand Safety Score which grades how brand friendly every streamer is based on things like chat behavior, ban history, manual ratings by Twitch staff, games played, age, automod and more (See below).&lt;br&gt;1/5 &lt;a href="https://t.co/VBl4HjGv7t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VBl4HjGv7t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daylam 'tayari' Tayari (@tayariCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS/status/1369230902409097218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xYizKA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitch a couple days ago added to their GQL (internal) API endpoints (keyword to query the API) for a "brandSafetyScore" which is sent to advertisers for ads, sponsors and also probably for bounty purposes.&lt;br&gt;Check this tweet's images for screenshots of the API changes.&lt;br&gt;2/5 &lt;a href="https://t.co/cHUzvnl50s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cHUzvnl50s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daylam 'tayari' Tayari (@tayariCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tayariCS/status/1369230907312279553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J8d4EV"&gt;If Tayari’s research is indeed accurate — and here I should note that I have reached out to Twitch and will update this story if I hear back — this would represent a shift in the way that advertisers interact with streamers on the platform. Presently, one of the main ways that marketers work with streamers on Twitch is the site’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/bounty-board-program-information-and-faq"&gt;bounty board&lt;/a&gt;; select partners and affiliates in the US, UK, Germany, and France can choose from a list of paid opportunities to either play games or watch branded videos with their communities for automatic payouts. It’s a pretty slick system, one that streamlines and automates the (occasionally arduous) process of working with a brand and getting paid for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aedmY"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine that if Twitch does in fact implement a brand safety score for streamers that it would be used to expand the bounty program; it seems like a useful thing for brands to be able to compare streamers on that specific axis, at least. Then again, for streamers, it does mean the site is tracking you on yet another metric that may or may not be available for you to see. I can’t help but think about Uber and Lyft ratings, and how quietly insidious they can be: if your rating gets screwed up for whatever reason, you lose your ability to drive — to make money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter sues Texas attorney general to stop content moderation probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hbFZwk7hXnZlCeJkoC8a8bt5H3A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935929/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EaL1sZ"&gt;Twitter has sued Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton for opening an investigation into its moderation practices, arguing that the probe attempts to “intimidate, harass, and target Twitter” in retaliation for banning former President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtBbI5"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.374770/gov.uscourts.cand.374770.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed the suit yesterday&lt;/a&gt; in California federal court. It’s asking the court to stop Paxton from demanding “volumes of highly confidential documents” on Twitter’s content moderation system. “Twitter sought for weeks to reach an agreement with AG Paxton that would put reasonable limits on the scope of this demand, but to no avail,” its complaint reads. “This retaliatory conduct violates the Constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIKTso"&gt;Paxton &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/news/releases/ag-paxton-issues-civil-investigative-demands-five-leading-tech-companies-regarding-discriminatory"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into Twitter — along with Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon — in January. In his announcement, he cited Trump’s ban from Facebook and Twitter as a “discriminatory” and “unprecedented” action. His office &lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2021/Press/Twitter-Parler%20CID%20011321.pdf"&gt;requested all files&lt;/a&gt;, including emails and other communication, related to content moderation on Twitter. (It also asked for communications related to the smaller social media platform Parler, despite the fact that Twitter hasn’t taken action against Parler’s account.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cLnEKc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter says the demands are meant to “intimidate, harass, and target” it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk7FoE"&gt;Twitter says it was exercising its First Amendment rights by refusing to publish Trump’s speech on the platform. And it says releasing internal moderation data would let bad-faith actors “carefully design their content to evade Twitter’s scrutiny,” drawing on confidential information. “While Twitter strives for as much transparency as possible, it cannot practically make every aspect of its content moderation practices public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73gxCY"&gt;Citing Paxton’s public statements excoriating social networks for banning Trump, Twitter calls the investigation a ploy to pressure private companies into allowing content that breaks their rules, something the First Amendment may prevent government officials from  doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3cjFW"&gt;In addition to Texas’ investigation of tech companies, Governor Greg Abbott recently backed a bill that would broadly &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2317860"&gt;ban large apps and websites&lt;/a&gt; from suspending users or removing content — a move that would also raise significant constitutional questions.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="WVaZV8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends: Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915315/league-of-legends-wild-rift-mobile-console-launch"&gt;spinoff&lt;/a&gt; of the PC game, is heading into open beta in North America on March 29th, developer Riot announced today. The beta will be available for mobile devices on iOS and Android. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="got5Fw"&gt;Riot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20915315/league-of-legends-wild-rift-mobile-console-launch"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; in 2019; it promised a March open beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220354/league-of-legends-wild-rift-open-beta-americas-release-date"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The game isn’t a true port but instead a “built from scratch” version with changed elements like the game’s controls and its maps. North American players will have “full access” to &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; as part of the beta, with room for more players to join. Although &lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt;’s open beta is currently only available to mobile players, the game is also expected to launch on consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4LAcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild Rift&lt;/em&gt; was initially expected to launch last year but was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wildrift/status/1320862775229382656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1320862775229382656%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fdotesports.com%2Fnews%2Friot-executive-producer-explains-wild-rifts-delay-in-north-america-south-america-and-india"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic; a full release date has not yet been announced. The beta is available in other territories. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s new season will kick off with an ‘explosive’ event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1Wc5T"&gt;A new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is almost here, which can only mean one thing: a big in-game event. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/play-the-zero-crisis-finale-in-chapter-2-season-6"&gt;Epic detailed what players can expect&lt;/a&gt; when season 6 of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter kicks off. It sounds pretty ambitious and even includes a story-focused solo experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BTtet"&gt;The event has been dubbed the “Zero Crisis Finale,” and here’s how Epic describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JKkCxC"&gt;Chapter 2 Season 6 launches on March 16th with the explosive conclusion of the events of season 5. When you first launch into the new season, you’ll play through the conclusion of Agent Jones’ mission in the Zero Crisis Finale. The aftermath of this event is sure to shape reality as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaaa9C"&gt;Don’t worry, the Zero Crisis Finale is a solo experience and you can play through it whenever you first log in during the season. Want to watch it online first? We’ll share details soon on how you can watch the global premiere with everyone, beginning with our most ambitious story cinematic yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkJSzP"&gt;These in-game events have long been one of the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; experience. The last, which was the conclusion of the game’s Marvel-themed season, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;featured a towering Galactus wreaking havoc on the island&lt;/a&gt;, before players worked together to take him down. Epic says it was the game’s biggest event to date, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21921491/fortnite-galactus-live-event-player-count"&gt;with more than 15 million concurrent players&lt;/a&gt;, beating out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;Travis Scott’s virtual concert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSMqkK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;Season 5 of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; started back in December&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a period that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;jammed with licensed tie-ins&lt;/a&gt;, from Baby Yoda and the Mandalorian to characters from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;G.I Joe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more. There’s even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;a Batman crossover comic on the way&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia partners with China for lunar space station</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Full Moon In China" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Ad_mA7-ZiId5nJmsPAff89jrBI=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68935768/1304458365.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6Fdmpd"&gt;Russia and China have signed an agreement to build and work on an “International Scientific Lunar Station” orbiting the Moon, the countries’ space agencies announced Tuesday. The space powers had been in talks for months as Russia mulled over whether it would participate in NASA’s Gateway program, a rival lunar space station to be built by a coalition of other countries in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iat536"&gt;The International Scientific Lunar Station that Russia and China will work on is “a complex of experimental research facilities created on the surface and/or in the orbit of the Moon,” Roscosmos said in a statement. It will be designed to support a variety of research experiments “with the possibility of long-term unmanned operation with the prospect of a human presence on the moon,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qca3F"&gt;Like NASA, China has been courting international support for its own plans to put infrastructure on the Moon. It’s also sent several robotic Chang’e missions to the Moon, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;first landing on the Moon’s far side&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178582/china-change-5-lunar-sample-return-mission"&gt;swift sample retrieval mission&lt;/a&gt; in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3ZoMM"&gt;The lunar space station agreement, signed virtually between China’s space chief Zhang Kejian and Russia’s space chief Dmitry Rogozin, marks the latest development in Beijing’s efforts to explore the Moon alongside rivals like NASA, which is barred from working with China under a law passed by Congress in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et2MAe"&gt;Russia, which has maintained a decades-long &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21276881/nasa-spacex-iss-international-space-station-future-commercial"&gt;partnership with NASA on the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, has been reluctant to extend its space alliance with the US to the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXffir"&gt;NASA stepped up its push to return astronauts on the Moon under the Trump administration through its Artemis program. Part of that push involved spearheading a multilateral pact called the Artemis Accords, an effort to set standards of behavior in space. Nine other countries have signed the Artemis Accords so far, but Russia is not among them, after the US sought to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-space-exploration-moon-mining-exclusi/exclusive-trump-administration-drafting-artemis-accords-pact-for-moon-mining-sources-idUSKBN22H2SB"&gt;exclude&lt;/a&gt; Moscow from early talks on the Accords last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mS1EmX"&gt;NASA secured agreements with the European Space Agency, Japan, and Canada for work on its Lunar Gateway, the planned space station orbiting the Moon. NASA did ask Russia to be a part of building that station, but Moscow decided that NASA’s request for Russia to provide an airlock for Gateway was “impractical,” a Roscosmos spokesperson said in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15SlS7"&gt;“NASA presented the Russian-American Memorandum of Understanding to Roscosmos concerning the cooperation within the Gateway project. The MoU suggested that Roscosmos commits to provide a crew airlock module,” the spokesperson said. “After studying the draft document, the participation of the Russian side to the volume suggested by the US partners was deemed impractical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1RQ4H"&gt;Russia soon pivoted its attentions to China’s lunar ambitions. Cooperating with China became one of Russia’s “top priorities” last year, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GxERG"&gt;The Russia-China agreement greenlights joint development of their own lunar space station, which calls for “planning, demonstration, design, development, implementation, and operation of scientific research station projects, including project promotion to the international aerospace community,” a statement from the China National Space Administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LXFQHF"&gt;It was unclear what specific technical contributions would be made by Russia, whose military-civil space agency has been investing in new launch infrastructure despite a domestic climate of budgetary rollbacks. Russia’s space budget &lt;a href="http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=289878940"&gt;ranks&lt;/a&gt; third globally, behind the United States and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Towy1x"&gt;China also held talks with France’s space agency CNES as a “status check of the bilateral space cooperation between the two agencies,” &lt;a href="https://presse.cnes.fr/en/cooperation-spatiale-entre-la-france-et-la-chine-reunion-entre-le-president-du-cnes-et"&gt;CNES said&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Among cooperation on climate science, Beijing’s Kejian and France’s space chief Jean-Yves Le Gall also discussed “other potential areas for cooperation in relation to the Moon and Mars,” the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
