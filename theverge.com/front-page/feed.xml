    <title>Google soon won’t let you sign in on very old Android devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jpgtxTZThD20c-Ja_SCEptRMXC4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664644/wjoel_180413_1777_android_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pz8PS"&gt;If you still have a device running Android 2.3.7 (the final version of Gingerbread) or older, Google won’t let you sign in to your Google account on that device starting September 27th, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/android/thread/118703101/sign-in-on-android-devices-running-android-2-3-7-or-lower-will-not-be-allowed-starting-september-27?hl=en"&gt;according to a support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://liliputing.com/2021/08/google-to-block-sign-ins-for-android-2-3-and-lower.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Liliputing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36lFPe"&gt;“As part of our ongoing efforts to keep our users safe, Google will no longer allow sign-in on Android devices that run Android 2.3.7 or lower starting September 27, 2021,” the company says. “If you sign into your device after September 27, you may get username or password errors when you try to use Google products and services like Gmail, YouTube, and Maps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhHc1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android 2.3.7 was released nearly 10 years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4nlU6"&gt;To give you an idea of just how old a device will be affected by this change, Android 2.3.7 was released nearly 10 years ago. But given that there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440813/android-devices-active-number-smartphones-google-2021"&gt;more than three billion active Android devices in the wild&lt;/a&gt; right now, this change will likely affect more than a few people who might still be holding on to older tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QabksW"&gt;If you’re on Android 2.3.7 or older after that September 27th deadline, you’ll still be able to use some Google services if you’re logged in on your device’s browser, according to Google. But devices on Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) will continue to be able to log in to Google accounts, the company says, so if your older device can be updated, you might want to do that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square to buy Afterpay, which offers a ‘buy now, pay later’ service, for $29 billion in stock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9v_3sKk5afS1qxDsWV1FZBDf55g=/0x130:3360x2370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664506/sq_online_store_phone.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somebody using a Square product on their phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Square&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHL0ar"&gt;Square plans to acquire Australian company &lt;a href="https://www.afterpay.com/en-US"&gt;Afterpay&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a “buy now, pay later” service that lets you pay for purchases in installments interest-free, for $29 billion in stock, &lt;a href="http://squareinc2020ir.q4web.com/news/news-details/2021/Square-Inc.-Announces-Plans-to-Acquire-Afterpay-Strengthening-and-Enabling-Further-Integration-Between-its-Seller-and-Cash-App-Ecosystems/default.aspx"&gt;the two companies announced Sunday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the latest big move for Square, which has also announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22579359/jack-dorsey-tbd-open-source-defi-crypto-square-bitcoin"&gt;a Bitcoin business unit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;that it bought a majority stake in the Tidal streaming service&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GerhZq"&gt;“Buy now, pay later” services like those offered by Afterpay, Affirm, and Klarna have become increasingly prevalent across the web. And Square may not be the only payments giant jumping into the ring, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575852/apple-pay-later-report-affirm-paypal-klarna-monthly-installments"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a similar service of its own&lt;/a&gt; that’s internally called “Apple Pay Later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G1YAoz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7QKE6F"&gt;Afterpay already serves more than 16 million customers and nearly 100,000 merchants across the world, according to a press release. Square and Afterpay expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2022. Once the acquisition is completed, Square will appoint an Afterpay director to join Square’s board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayhgZQ"&gt;“Square and Afterpay have a shared purpose. We built our business to make the financial system more fair, accessible, and inclusive, and Afterpay has built a trusted brand aligned with those principles,” Square co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey said in a statement. “Together, we can better connect our Cash App and Seller ecosystems to deliver even more compelling products and services for merchants and consumers, putting the power back in their hands.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Galaxy Watch photos show Samsung and Google’s new smartwatch OS on an actual device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-jmP1e0d2Ik3E5OnZNZcrhQWIo0=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69664249/samsung_galaxy_watch_4_featured_watermarked.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photos of the rumored Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-design-revealed-live-images/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3lb6vO"&gt;We’re a little over a week away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585256/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-watch-unpacked-event-august"&gt;from Samsung’s next Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-design-revealed-live-images/"&gt;new photos from &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; may have revealed our first in-person look at two things we could see at the show: the rumored Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and the new smartwatch OS from Samsung and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qwk8h0"&gt;The two photos from &lt;em&gt;91moblies&lt;/em&gt; show off black and silver watches with rounded bezels, matching a design seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;leaked renders from &lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572858/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2021-leak-evan-blass-galaxy-z-fold-flip-3-s21-fe-watch-4-buds-2-date"&gt;detailed GIFs posted by noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt; in July. Perhaps more significantly, the photos show the new smartwatch OS (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;currently referred to as Wear&lt;/a&gt;) on actual devices for the first time. But disappointingly, there isn’t much to see — just an initial setup screen and a screen asking the user to set the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQliy8"&gt;Google and Samsung announced they would be essentially merging Wear OS and Tizen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;at Google I/O in May&lt;/a&gt;, promising improvements to battery life, faster app loading times, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443809/google-samsung-wear-os-tizen-things-we-know"&gt;and other more&lt;/a&gt;. And in May, Samsung gave us an idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;of what the new OS will look like on its devices&lt;/a&gt; (and it looks great in what the company showed, if you ask me). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaYM_axvOnfGnf-_7FrVk8DI7Z4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22754816/One_UI_Watch_App_Ecosystem_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hz4AXe"&gt;While Samsung’s teases for August 11th’s Unpacked &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hint strongly toward new foldables&lt;/a&gt;, the company has revealed new smartwatches at previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;Unpacked&lt;/a&gt; events, so it’s possible we could see a new smartwatch next week. And based on other recent leaks, Samsung may announce &lt;em&gt;another&lt;/em&gt; smartwatch as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;the Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ariana Grande is headlining Fortnite’s next concert series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xwyvkRrEXYcbClHY6Zai8Ndyv-k=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663897/Ariana_x_Fortnite_Key_Art_3.15.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LpUwK6"&gt;Last week, Epic Games teased that a “record-breaking superstar” would be performing in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599908/fortnite-rift-tour-concert-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; upcoming Rift Tour concert series&lt;/a&gt;, and now we know that the mystery performer is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1421894007697952775"&gt;none other than Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22YDkD"&gt;The five-show concert series kicks off August 6th at 6PM ET, and shows will run through August 8th. (&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-rift-tour-featuring-ariana-grande"&gt;You can find the full schedule here&lt;/a&gt;.) Epic recommends being ready in-game 60 minutes before any of the performances so that you can jump into the Rift Tour playlist when it goes live 30 minutes ahead of showtime. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; events have filled up in the past — I personally missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “The Device” event&lt;/a&gt; in-game because I signed on too late — so I’d recommend showing up early to the Rift Tour shows just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eLfyLw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="et" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rifttour?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rifttour&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;august 6-8&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FortniteGame&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO"&gt;https://t.co/Mlf5Xpl9HO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/pTgLJ7e67O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pTgLJ7e67O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/1421893658689814531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I5e5Mw"&gt;As for what you can expect from the shows? “Building on and incorporating other celebrated &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments, the Rift Tour will begin with experiences that pair popular tracks with moments based on elements from the game,” &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/ariana-grande-steps-into-the-metaverse-as-the-headliner-for-fortnites-rift-tour"&gt;according to Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. “Players will be able to travel side by side with their friends on a journey to magical new realities where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and Ariana collide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orBgKT"&gt;Epic will also be selling a skin based on Grande as part of its Icon Series, which features real-world celebrities like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date"&gt;LeBron James&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt;. Grande’s skin will go on sale August 4th at 8PM ET, meaning you can show up to Grande’s concert dressed as Grande, and you can get a preview of the skin and a backpack based on her &lt;a href="https://arianagrande.fandom.com/wiki/Piggy_Smallz"&gt;actual pet pig, Piggy Smallz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YBjRi_UNY8o"&gt;in this teaser video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFDrYb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YBjRi_UNY8o?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rB6Wvs"&gt;If you attend the concert, you’ll also get a special umbrella glider. Players who subscribe to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612524/fortnite-crew-subscription-chapter-2-season-5-price-release-date"&gt;monthly &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Crew subscription&lt;/a&gt; will get some exclusive bonuses for attending, including a rainbow variant of the concert umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ptdx3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; past concerts have been massively successful — more than 10 million people watched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello’s in-game concert in February 2019&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;more than 12 million people attended&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s surreal &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; performance in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;. It seems likely that Epic will be aiming to up the spectacle with this latest concert, and we’ll have to wait and see what the combination Grande’s performance inside of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;currently alien-themed world&lt;/a&gt; could bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Eqeo"&gt;Grande’s performance &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-20-huge-fortnite-leak-points-to-upcoming-ariana-grande-concert"&gt;was rumored in July&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-04-fortnite-planned-metroid-crossover-ariana-and-lady-gaga-concerts"&gt;documents unearthed as part of Epic’s case against Apple&lt;/a&gt; also revealed that Epic was planning a concert with the megastar. The event seems to have been in the works for quite some time — according to a June 2020 document from the case, a Grande concert was in the works for that October. At the time, a J Balvin concert was set for that September, which ended up happening a month later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21525028/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-jbalvin-concert"&gt;as part of the game’s Halloween event&lt;/a&gt;, while a still-unannounced Lady Gaga concert was planned for that December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RryrLs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 1st, 2:48PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added description from Epic Games about the performances.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jungle Cruise earned a third of its opening revenues from Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKc9Mf8X5WLbVP1oPCIrfKCp9PM=/103x0:1198x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69663835/g_junglecruise_18970_1_bb702394.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in Disney’s &lt;/em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="crska5"&gt;Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; debuted in theaters and as a Disney Plus Premier Access title this weekend, and early revenue totals from the entertainment giant show that streaming accounted for a third of the film’s revenues, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jungle-cruise-box-office-disney-green-knight-1234991247/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sunday’s &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt; numbers mark the second time Disney has released figures for a movie offered as part of the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers pay $30 to stream certain films the same day they hit theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4NTGZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million is half of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;$60 million &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; earned on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; over the same period following its early July debut, but &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; Disney Plus revenue represented a bigger slice of the total revenue pie than streaming did for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise’s&lt;/em&gt; $30 million was about 33 percent of its $91.8 million total, while &lt;em&gt;Black Widow’s&lt;/em&gt; $60 million was about 27 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/black-widow-disney-revenue-game-changer-1234980611/"&gt;its $218.8 million total&lt;/a&gt;. Premier Access was also an option for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315306/disney-raya-and-the-last-dragon-southeast-asian-media"&gt;March’s &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22400212/cruella-review-disney-plus-emma-stone-101-dalmatians"&gt;May’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but Disney hasn’t shared figures for those movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wBo7cH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The numbers arrive just days after Scarlett Johansson’s lawsuit over Black Widow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HP63Kw"&gt;The new numbers also arrive just days after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Scarlett Johansson’s major lawsuit against Disney&lt;/a&gt;, which alleged that Disney reneged on a promise to release &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; exclusively in theaters. The lawsuit is perhaps the biggest pushback yet against the direct-to-streaming model — &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168881/denis-villeneuve-christopher-nolan-anger-hbo-max-streaming-att"&gt;Denis Villeneuve blasted WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; in December after the studio announced it would release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;all of its 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;theaters weren’t a fan of that move, either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbPEC3"&gt;While WarnerMedia has already announced plans to release 10 Warner Bros. films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;day-and-date in theaters and on streaming services in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, Disney hasn’t announced any Premier Access titles that may follow &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elite students are debating hot-button issues on an invite-only TikTok clone</title>

  &lt;p&gt;To combat online polarization, Polemix aims to make young people ‘listen to the outside’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PPaNzb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10669616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap c-end-para" id="V0DW5A"&gt;At a glance, the video looks like a TikTok. But toward the bottom, where a TikTok’s caption would be, are two large buttons. One reads “Respect But Disagree.” The other reads “Convinced By You.” Across the top is a question, written in white: “Should Dems pack the Court?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmeBE2"&gt;“Hell no,” declares a young woman, whom the app labels “Naomi, Political Science” onscreen. “If Republicans are elected in the future, they’re now going to be more likely to stack the court as well.” Swipe up and “Brian, Founder, Oxford Political Review” appears to express an opposing viewpoint. “As much as I believe Democrats ought uphold norms of civility or neutrality and all that, in theory, look: The reality is it’s dirty, and it’s time we fight back,” Brian declares. Brian’s video is the top-voted video on court-packing, having earned a combined 17 “Respect But Disagree” and “Convinced By You” votes since its posting. Naomi’s video is in fourth place, with four.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Naomi says, “Hell no.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t8U4h9"&gt;This is Polemix, a new, exclusive app aimed at promoting free discourse among young people. As the world’s biggest social networks continuously battle misinformation and draw controversial lines between dangerous and appropriate speech, the founders of Polemix believe they’ve found a better solution: a free market of ideas, with selective admission. So far, the app has attracted a young community that’s eloquent, outspoken, and passionate about the app’s stated philosophy. But it has also served as a microcosmic experiment with online debate culture in concentrated form, and a real-world demonstration of the caveats required to bring such a lofty ideal to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="S5b17g"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLcKAP"&gt;“Naomi” is Naomi Panovka, a rising third-year student at McGill. “Brian” is Brian Wong, a Rhodes scholar studying politics at Oxford. The two were selected earlier this year as part of a group that Polemix’s founders refer to as “Leaders” — 40 elite young people who were tasked with building the app’s community while driving its early dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT39al"&gt;“It was people who are quite passionate about public speaking in general, who cared about discourse,” Panovka says. “People who they thought would be good representatives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twdC2K"&gt;There was no formal application to become a Leader — the founders hand-picked the group through their networks. Per Polemix’s website, the cadre includes “some of the world’s top thinkers.” The founders describe them as “very carefully selected university leaders.” In practice, the vast majority of the &lt;a href="https://polemix.co/leaders"&gt;listed group&lt;/a&gt; are decorated high school and college debaters. Panovka competed for Canada’s national team in high school and has reached the finals of over 10 university-level competitions; Wong was a semifinalist at the 2020 world championships. The group is diverse when it comes to race, gender, and nationality, but famous universities are heavily represented. Cambridge, Oxford, LSE, and Yale all make several appearances on the list and can claim a majority of the listed Leaders as students or alumni.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDdOLg"&gt;College debate was formative for Polemix founder and CEO Ian Sielecki. He competed during his time as a student at Cambridge and has organized public debates for the Athens Democracy Forum. Sielecki has long felt that social media could learn from the college debate scene; he sees Polemix as a tool to combat online echo chambers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxHItX"&gt;“Social networks, by the way they operate through their algorithms, they only give you content that you already agree with, which means they radicalize you,” says Sielecki. The idea behind Polemix, he says, “was to create, inspired from the magic of debating, a conceptual landscape in which people would hear, listen to the outside by design.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Explore tab on Polemix. Three questions are listed: Should human gene editing be legal, did COVID leak from a Wuhan lab, and is Facebook killing people?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X2cNbZ53TmaULCYXcEnahz4W7zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733730/213278797_253097286306085_4313126787021908776_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Polemix’s “Explore” tab, you can scroll through various questions that have been debated in the past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Start Debate tab on Polemix. The user is prompted to “Write a question here.” Below is a notice that reads, “Only leaders are able to start debates,” and a Next button that isn’t functional because the criteria hasn’t been met." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZFASeGMO730upZ_NsqHJs9Tq8GY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733731/215567958_161507885951476_8632556073972102321_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you aren’t a Leader, you can’t create new questions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oNDGaG"&gt;Early on, Sielecki and his team identified young people as their target audience. Specifically, “young people passionate about something,” according to Ismaël Emelien, Sielecki’s co-founder. Emelien isn’t a college debater, but rather a cofounder of France’s En Marche political party and a former adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron. But he feels that Sielecki’s frustrations map to the global political landscape. “People just ... can’t listen to the other side anymore,” Emelien says. “This is the first thing we need to fix in real life. The way to do that is to target young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vEtJ3g"&gt;Polemix’s interface borrows a lot from TikTok — swipe down for a new video, everything capped at 30 seconds — but the content couldn’t be more different. Every Polemix video features a person making an argument for or against a preset list of questions, from “Will Federer win Wimbledon?” and “Is Canada superior to America?” to “Does Instagram objectify women?” and “Is physician-assisted suicide unethical?” As a user scrolls, they’re shown videos for each question in groups of up to four: a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No,” a “Hell Yes,” a “Hell No.” They can vote, or scroll, accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMlY79"&gt;The algorithm takes both “Convinced By You” and “Respect But Disagree” votes into account when prioritizing the videos you see. As Sielecki notes, “The Respect But Disagree is quite important for your video to be popular.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="bcUEKv"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nbw2Bo"&gt;Every social media platform grapples with harassment and outright hate speech, but Polemix walks a particularly difficult line because its explicit goal is to celebrate differences of opinion. The app does have an explicit rule against hate speech: “Hate is for losers” is its slogan, one that Sielecki emphasizes in pitching the app, and one that was attractive to some of the initial members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O3Yogs"&gt;“The idea is to welcome people from every side of every controversial question. We will have people from the Trump administration, from QAnon making videos,” Emelien says. “That’s not a problem for us, as long as it is expressed in respect for the rules of Polemix, meaning it’s not hateful.” He emphasizes that “the people watching this video will be exposed, by design, to the other side arguing against those videos ... That’s our remedy.” (Of course, that also means a user won’t necessarily see a representative sample of opinions. “Has #MeToo gone too far?” has 10 “Hell No” responses and just four “Hell Yes” responses, but a scrolling user will still see two of each — arguably giving more contrarian views an easier path to exposure.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the statistics for a question on Polemix: “Do public figures have a right to privacy?” A graph labeled “Convinced votes” shows 64 percent Yes and 36 percent No. A graph labeled “People showing Respect” shows 43 percent Yes. Shane Tully is credited as having started the debate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/56LQZMqNbF1q9d_R5PmZDpJuNNw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733738/217651517_582662702724997_6678203213305705519_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For each question, you can view the percent of viewers who were convinced, and the percent who selected “Respect But Disagree.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Polemix’s list of debatable questions. Each leader is credited for their question. Questions include: Is it cruel to have a baby today (by Samuel Hvitse), Is Jagger greater than Lennon (by Judith Goldenthale), Should the US be more socialist (by Matt Caito), Should we abolish prisons (by Sharon Chau), Are the Tokyo Olympics a dangerous idea (by Roshan Melwani), and Should NCAA athletes be paid?" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p4KxN7_eptmdO-WA1DewxFJK48I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733739/217511736_600116368043527_1559460927487504693_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When creating a new video, you’re prompted to select a question from a preset list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdiQu"&gt;The other tool reining in the discourse is the questions users are asked to respond to, which set the tone for the conversations that follow. For Polemix’s first few months, only Leaders have been able to create new questions, a major privilege that sets them apart from the rest of the community. Many of the Leaders are acquainted through the debate community and discuss new questions behind the scenes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CcvE6"&gt;Sielecki and Emelien agree that some questions are so conducive to bigotry as to be off-limits; debates about “race science,” no matter how respectful, would be a no-go. Asked how the team goes about drawing that line, Sielecki replied, “It’s relatively clear what racism is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKQKjM"&gt;But the app has touched on just about every controversial issue you might think of, and some questions that have gotten the green light would likely be in a gray area, if not over the line, for progressive circles on and off the internet. “Should Cosby be left in peace?”, “Is Pride Day still necessary?”, “Should IQ tests be mandatory?”, “Is JK Rowling transphobic?”, “Has political correctness gone too far?”, “Is America racist?”, “Did COVID leak from a Wuhan lab?”, and “Did religion get homosexuality wrong?” have all been debated on Polemix since the app’s founding. Even with safeguards in place, founders who endorse these questions are drawing an ideological line, however unconsciously — one that puts a high degree of trust in their community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website showing four people beneath the heading “Leaders of all opinions and generations.” Below the pictures appears a question: “Are you afraid to listen to the other side?”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7jYjLlQ_Q3Ht4Akk5JrNemUShM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733742/p6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Polemix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaders and their accomplishments are advertised on Polemix’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iLg4Kx"&gt;So far, Polemix has mostly avoided the right-wing lurch many might expect from a platform focused on quick-twitch debating. As of this writing, a “Hell yes” is winning “Should we tax to eliminate billionaires?” and “Should we have a universal basic income?”; a “Hell No” is winning “More restriction on immigration?” and “MLB too woke?” A “Hell Yes” is winning “Should we abolish prisons?” and “Should we abolish the police?” by a significant margin. None of the users I spoke to seem to have remotely right-wing political beliefs. Wong describes themself as “a hardcore progressive.” And the users I spoke to universally love Polemix’s environment and find the community supportive and engaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3RmZG"&gt;“It’s Reddit meets Twitter, but instead of Twitter trolls and Reddit downvoters who swarm you, you’ve just got high-quality or relatively high-quality discourse,” says Wong, who spends one to two hours on Polemix every day. “I’ve very rarely, if at all, seen any content that’s reminiscent of hate speech.” Sielecki and Emelien say they’ve had very few issues with trolls so far. “One out of every thousand is a hater,” Sielecki estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxGK2Q"&gt;Amanda Timerman, who’s not a leader (she learned about Polemix at a party), says the app’s intellectual community is “therapeutic” for her. “Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, everything there, it’s like the minute you say something ... you’re going to be immediately judged,” Timerman says. Polemix, she feels, is “really and truly a safe space ... It really makes me feel good, and it makes me feel really self-confident to have an opinion on things that normally I wouldn’t discuss.” She added, “It’s like my own personal talk show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSiH14"&gt;The prospect of young people hosting their own talk shows online isn’t always a recipe for enlightened discourse, as the swamp of online debate challenges demonstrates. The spectacle of those challenges has proven to be a good way for influencers to build hype and attract new audiences on platforms like YouTube and Twitch, but the debates themselves often take a back seat to clout-chasing. As popular Twitch commentator Hasan Piker put it in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22556239/hasan-piker-twitch-gore-vidal-steven-crowder-sam-seder-h3-podcast-ethan-klein"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“[I]t’s just pseudo-intellectual wrestling. It’s sport, and it’s not productive ... People just want to beat their opponent, so they’re not necessarily ideologically shifting anyone. Instead, the 20 percent of the audience that is maybe malleable gravitates toward whoever the top-dog debater is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbCK8k"&gt;For Polemix, the challenge is to succeed where YouTube and Twitch have mostly failed: essentially, to build a platform where trolls don’t win. Polemix’s founders are confident in their algorithm, and so are the users I spoke to. “A lot of the social media debates that you see online — vitriolic, bitter, vicious, surly. It’s just not polite,” Wong says. But on Polemix, “It’s just people talking. And people talking humanely.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJxrnP"&gt;But Polemix is still invite-only, with only 2,500 users (and a waitlist of “a couple of thousand,” per Sielecki), and it’s not clear how well the platform will fare if the reins are loosened. The founders are in the process of rolling out question-setting privileges to more users, and new Leaders will need to meet a minimum threshold of video views and votes. Emelien and Sielecki also plan to start adding more users soon — they recently offered invitations to all participants in the 2021 university world championships. They don’t, however, know if or when they’ll be letting the masses in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot from Polemix’s website.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Polemix brings together the world’s brightest youth.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5iUww7"&gt;“We ensure that we have quality every step of the way,” Sielecki says. “We’re not going to grow massively just to grow, without taking care of the safety that the ecosystem offers to users and the quality of the content that is being created.” In other words: there’s no timeline yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hwFawg"&gt;Among Leaders and members, there are some doubts about whether Polemix will be able to court non-debaters as it grows. Some members are nervous about changing the community’s character. “Right now, it kind of feels like I’m in a little cocoon,” Timerman says, though she’s aware that “the only way to grow is to eventually open it up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="n7n1JL"&gt;But Wong is confident enough in the community’s passion and values that they’re not worried about trolls. For them, the floodgates can’t open soon enough. “I’m very excited,” they say. “I can’t wait until we have unleashed the kraken.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Latest IDC numbers reiterate Apple’s dominance of tablet market</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air has the same design and shape as the 11-inch iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hM3dNfax2EBfkBmyopTGAlbm7YM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661644/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U4Zfn1"&gt;Earlier this week during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;Apple’s earnings&lt;/a&gt; call, CEO Tim Cook said that the iPad had experienced its most successful June quarter in nearly a decade. And now &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48120621"&gt;IDC is out with its latest worldwide shipment figures&lt;/a&gt; that underline Apple’s commanding lead over the tablet competition. After refreshing the iPad Air in 2020 and launching an upgraded iPad Pro earlier this year, Apple is next expected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573423/ipad-mini-2021-release-date-news-features-bezels"&gt;update the iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycfd5d"&gt;IDC estimates that Apple shipped 12.9 million iPads in the second quarter. Its nearest competition is Samsung, which hit 8 million shipments. Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21444688/samsung-galaxy-tab-s7-plus-review"&gt;Galaxy Tab S7 tablets&lt;/a&gt; offer fantastic hardware and punchy OLED screens, but they remain hamstrung by Android’s less-than-stellar selection of tablet apps. Lenovo, which continues to release well-received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Chrome OS tablets&lt;/a&gt;, took third with 4.7M units shipped, and Amazon came in fourth with 4.3 million Fire tablet shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqYqGq"&gt;Both PC and tablet shipments have surged over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as people have adapted to working from home and remote education. IDC’s figures reveal that Chromebook shipments have grown 68.6 percent year over year and reached 12.3 million units shipped in the second quarter. “While this wasn’t a record quarter for Chromebooks, it wasn’t far off the prior two quarters, which shattered previous highs,” IDC wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67AyqS"&gt;But IDC does point to a possible slowdown in sales for Chromebooks and tablets due to ongoing chip shortages and an easing of consumer demand as more people return to the workplace or classroom. Apple has said that supply constraints could be detrimental to iPad sales in the coming months, and the iPhone might be affected as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google pairs Stadia Controller and Chromecast as $100 ‘play and watch’ bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ul9QntN82eMgI0V1MIcBvANVgDg=/39x0:1821x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661331/Screen_Shot_2021_07_31_at_12.43.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xywYVd"&gt;Google has recently been selling a combo-package of the Stadia Controller and 2020 Chromecast as a limited-time promotion. But &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/30/stadia-controller-chromecast-google-tv-package/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has now made the pair a permanent bundle that it’s calling the “play and watch” package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvIth5"&gt;For $99.99, you get both the controller and streaming dongle. That’s a savings of $19 compared to buying both products separately. Google is also promoting the Chromecast ethernet adapter as a recommended accessory; if you want the absolute best Stadia experience, it’s probably a smart buy — and it’s a mere $9.99 ($10 off) when purchased alongside the bundle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7PknS"&gt;In an effort to clear out inventory of the old, puck-shaped Chromecast Ultra, Google is discounting its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;Stadia Premiere Edition bundle&lt;/a&gt; yet again to $79.99. I’d definitely recommend the newer Chromecast with Google TV over the older one. The streaming experience is much richer and more comprehensive on the newer device. But if you’re strictly using it as a gateway to Stadia, the $79.99 deal might be worth hopping on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEiWcO"&gt;Remember that Google’s game streaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522416/google-stadia-chromecast-tv-nvidia-shield-android-devices-list-date"&gt;now supports select Android TV&lt;/a&gt; products as well. So if you’ve got a TV running that software, all you really need to get going is Google’s controller or a compatible third-party Bluetooth gamepad. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanks to the Rickroll, ‘Never Gonna Give You Up’ hits 1 billion YouTube plays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of Rick ASTLEY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tAylZJ29DTAFX3fXTtrB1vRRx0=/0x0:2661x1774/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69661138/85355127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Bernd Muller/Redferns&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0sSB6w"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"&gt;official video&lt;/a&gt; for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit “Never Gonna Give You Up” has surpassed 1 billion plays on YouTube. The song became a lasting part of internet culture thanks to the Rickroll meme and reached the impressive milestone a couple days ago. Astley took to the video’s comments to share his gratitude, saying “amazing, crazy, wonderful!” In a video posted to Instagram, he added “the world is a wonderful and beautiful place, and I am very lucky.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE9AtU"&gt;With some songs having crossed &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJQP7kiw5Fk"&gt;as many as 7 billion views&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, the 1 billion club isn’t quite as prestigious as it once was. But the achievement goes to show the staying power of the Rickroll prank. The video hit daily views of 2.3 million on April Fools Day, according to &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/9607871/rick-astley-never-gonna-give-you-up-video-billion-views/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just in the past couple years, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21138550/fortnite-rickroll-new-emote-never-gonna-give-you-up-rick-astley"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; emotes&lt;/a&gt; and fan-made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22289657/never-gonna-give-you-up-4k"&gt;4K remasters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vctDWy"&gt;Back in 2008, the man himself &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wL-hNMJvcyI"&gt;Rickrolled the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade&lt;/a&gt;. The meme was also put to excellent use when the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDs7KkGcQ6M"&gt;San Diego Padres trolled the Boston Red Sox&lt;/a&gt; just as fans thought they were about to belt out the chorus to “Sweet Caroline.” If you’ve got other prime examples, the comments section awaits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joVsmq"&gt;I’m curious what the average watch time is for “Never Gonna Give You Up.” After being duped, how many people have closed out the window in aggravation within seconds of hearing the drum intro and synths coming in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="874YsE"&gt;Astley celebrated joining the billion plays club by releasing a limited, &lt;a href="https://rickastley.tmstor.es/?lf=f8891a33f848b3f0690358b04f4f6543"&gt;already-sold-out&lt;/a&gt; run of 7-inch blue vinyl pressings of the quintessential ‘80s jam. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A starter pack of Nanoleaf’s stunning canvas panels is $50 off at Costco today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KRU0SgGVT1IzFaLp41a3jV_Y3A=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69660862/Nanoleaf_Canvas_Light_Panel_Lifestyle_Image__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nanoleaf’s canvas light panels are easy to set up and can display more than 16 million colors. | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqYYzg"&gt;If you like your lighting to be on the adventurous side, rest assured that Nanoleaf’s canvas light panels aren’t made to be subtle. The touch-sensitive squares are flashy and versatile, with the ability to display more than 16 million colors and a modular design that lets you place them in a variety of patterns. The bright LED panels also work with all the major smart home platforms, and can cycle through a number of preset colors or respond to sound when in “Rhythm Mode,” a feature that’s just as suited for the ambient noise outside your bedroom as your favorite record. Right now, Costco members can purchase &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/nanoleaf-canvas-light-panels---smarter-kit.product.100743148.html"&gt;Nanoleaf’s Canvas Light Panel smarter pack&lt;/a&gt; with nine panels and everything needed to get started for $150, one of the better prices we’ve seen on the intuitive lighting system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0O0A5M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The jet-black wireless gaming headset features an adjustable headband, a sturdy build, and support for both PC and PlayStation consoles, with THX Spatial Audio simulated surround sound available on the former. Normally $100, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13140756?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Frazer-nari-essential-gaming-headset-21" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Woot for $55&lt;/a&gt;, more than 45 percent off its typical list price. If Razer’s budget-friendly Nari Essential doesn’t offer what you’re looking for, however, we’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;best gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; overall, including multiplatform models and both wired and wireless alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LbANK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10677664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8qexkJ"&gt;Good noise-cancellation can be hard to come by for $100 — just look at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;Nothing Ear 1s&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, there’s the second-gen Amazon Echo Buds, a pair of true wireless earbuds that churn out satisfying sound while benefitting from improved comfort and noise cancellation over their first-gen counterpart. Amazon’s mid-range earbuds, which are now &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747338177907879421#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for a limited time at Best Buy for $80&lt;/a&gt;, also feature IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and allow for hands-free voice commands via Alexa, meaning Amazon’s virtual assistant is always available at the tip of your tongue. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
