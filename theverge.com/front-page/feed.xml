    <title>Elden Ring debuts 15 minutes of new gameplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2q712_Eyq3uR7K2TuPwF33CBYH8=/124x0:1539x943/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093879/eldenring.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mPXEyw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22732651/from-software-elden-ring-release-date-delayed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the newest &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; game from FromSoftware, was featured in a livestream event showing off 15 minutes of new footage — the biggest chunk of gameplay we’ve seen yet. The preview debuted some exciting, never-before-seen features like item crafting and a very detailed world map while also giving us a glimpse of what’s sure to be a crowd favorite — the spirit horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CxHl8l"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JldMvQMO_5U?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qkpzy8"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; footage was from a PC build, showing off impressive visuals from the world known as the Lands Between. Instead of bonfires or lanterns, sites of grace are now where Tarnished can rest and replenish their health. Occasionally, touching a site of grace will spawn a beacon that can guide players to their next objective, which will definitely come in handy for such a seemingly large and expansive world.  To help travel through the world, you’re given a spirit horse, which was my favorite part of the demo. I hope we’ll have the opportunity to bond with our spirit horse ala Roach from &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;. It is unknown if you can pet the spirit horsey, but I understand you can feed it, fight on it, and use it to vault off spirit springs and fly through the air to reach elevated areas.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3DAMmQqah9Cx9z3RUcU7p5syxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985824/ezgif.com_gif_maker__1_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Bandai Namco&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PQ0t7V"&gt;Epona, eat your heart out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUDSup"&gt;The demo previewed the co-op system, calling in a fierce-looking barbarian lady to assist with a boss. For those who wish to play offline to avoid a potential invasion, you can summon spirits for a short time to help you take down a pack of enemies. According to the video, there are different types of spirits, allowing you to mix and match your spirit parties to find one that best suits your playstyle. For those of us (me, I mean me) who have a hard time with some of the more difficult elements of &lt;em&gt;Souls&lt;/em&gt; games, this spirit helper system is sure to come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBdN3q"&gt;The preview didn’t go too in-depth about what kind of story &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; tells, although we did meet a woman with a tattooed eye named Melina who apparently wants to offer us an accord. We also saw one of the game’s bosses, Godric the Golden, who, as the self-styled king of all things golden with a prancing lion on his axe, could be a long-lost &lt;a href="https://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/House_Lannister"&gt;Lannister&lt;/a&gt; and a whiff of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22643950/elden-ring-preview-fromsoftware-george-rr-martin"&gt;George R. R. Martin’s influence&lt;/a&gt; on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1UrwF"&gt;The preview ended with a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LBKJKl195C0"&gt;brand new trailer&lt;/a&gt; and the reveal of the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/puUJhaBJdF8"&gt;Collector’s and Premium Collector’s edition&lt;/a&gt; of the game (which was spoiled earlier in the day by commercials on Twitch). Pre-orders are available now, with Premium edition buyers getting a sweet-ass 1:1 replica of the winged helmet Malenia, Blade of Miquella, wears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DXekqU"&gt;

    <title>The best iPhone gaming controller now works with Android phones — but you’ll need a cable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BackBone One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFs2R-z4LZgDMsyD2XzPePSTR2A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093769/cfaulkner_201016_4242_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaILkA"&gt;Last year, a small company called Backbone Labs released arguably the best iPhone gaming controller on the market right now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;the Backbone One&lt;/a&gt;. Starting Thursday, you’ll be able to use that controller with many more devices — including Android phones — though it won’t work exactly as you might expect &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; requires a new Backbone Plus subscription to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6FqOo"&gt;Here’s how using the controller with other devices works. The Backbone One is designed to let you slot in an iPhone in landscape mode to a Lightning port on the right side of the controller. To use the Backbone One with a non-iPhone device, you can’t plop it into the controller since it requires plugging into that Lightning port. Instead, you have to pick what type of device you want to connect it to in the Backbone app settings menu and then hook up the device to the controller with a Lightning-to-USB cable. (The Backbone One has a Lightning port to plug the cable into.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cD5hov"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Playing Crossy Road Castle on my MacBook Air worked great&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5LsZG"&gt;I tested the feature out by connecting the Backbone One to my M1 MacBook Air to play &lt;em&gt;Crossy Road Castle. &lt;/em&gt;It worked great, and I had no trouble traversing dangerous platforms as a tiny voxel chicken. I wasn’t able to test the Backbone One with an Android device, but if it works as well as it did with my Mac, it should be a perfectly capable gaming controller. If you unsubscribe from Backbone Plus, your Backbone One controller will still work with your iPhone and the last non-iPhone device you had it configured for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJBP9Q"&gt;The Backbone Plus subscription comes with a lot more benefits than just letting you use the controller with other devices. One impressive feature is that you’ll be able to stream to Twitch right from the Backbone app. That means you’ll be able to easily stream yourself playing your favorite mobile game or even a PlayStation or Xbox game over console streaming. In a test I did, the video on my Twitch stream was pretty laggy, but that might just be due to my network, and I didn’t see any performance issues with my iPhone 12 Mini while the broadcast was going.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHfLIqnbMtM1wIk58ncHhyFJ4s0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984103/TwitchStreaming.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Backbone Labs&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Backbone One’s orange button is surrounded by a purple ring while you’re streaming on Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ItjjfI"&gt;Backbone is also adding some new video recording features in its subscription. You’ll be able to record at 1080p and 60fps on iOS 15 devices, up from 30fps, and there’s a new Smart Record option that lets you hold down the capture button to record the last 15 seconds of your game. The app’s useful catalog of games, videos, highlights, and more also now shows information from many different gaming services instead of just native iOS games, and search has been improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Cy2dZ"&gt;With Backbone Plus, you’ll be able to use all of the app’s software features. New Backbone users will be given a free year of the service, and if you opt to renew, it’ll cost $49 per year. If you choose not to subscribe, you’ll still be able to use the Backbone One as an iPhone gaming controller, and the app will still install software updates to the controller, but you won’t be able to take advantage of the other software features offered with the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8O5BrL"&gt;And current Backbone players are in luck. Every Backbone user who has made an account before Thursday will be given a free lifetime membership to Backbone Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKyS7M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Backbone One is a stunning controller that turns your iPhone into a more capable gaming device","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Merry Cringemas, here is a bad trailer for a worse movie about Nintendo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w_axpXq8uuam5PjuFZvUA5vXQjo=/0x0:711x474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093698/msedge_B54BE3Bbsp.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: HBO Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5zYsC"&gt;Warner Bros. may be putting a solid contender in the annual competition for the worst Christmas movie if the official trailer for &lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt; is anything to go by. Picture the kid from &lt;em&gt;Jingle All The Way &lt;/em&gt;having to embark upon a wacky adventure to find &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; the perfect toy for Christmas, told through a &lt;em&gt;How I Met Your Mother&lt;/em&gt;-style framing device, and you’re pretty much there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBUtjb"&gt;The trailer sees Neil Patrick Harris narrating a story from one of his childhood winters, in which he and a group of friends compete to win an original NES for Christmas. After all, what could be more festive than a brand-new video game console? And no global chip shortages in sight! Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fLOJMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No global chip shortages in sight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R5bOqG"&gt;As far as I’m concerned, outside of a small handful of bonafide classics like &lt;em&gt;It’s a Wonderful Life&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Elf&lt;/em&gt; (and no, I will not be engaging with the “is &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt; a Christmas movie?” discourse), films focused on Christmas are uniformly terrible. But isn’t that the point? I don’t think anyone is looking for a cinematic masterpiece when December 25th rolls around. They’re looking for the vaguest of background noise to draw their attention away from the gnawing sensation that they &lt;em&gt;just might &lt;/em&gt;have overdone it on the food. Or maybe that’s just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1lqVq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;8-Bit Christmas&lt;/em&gt; is streaming on HBO Max starting November 24th. If you’d like to get into the festive spirit early, please enjoy this short clip of a child &lt;em&gt;loosing his goddamn mind &lt;/em&gt;opening a Nintendo 64.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xhGXVt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFlcqWQVVuU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Google is working on a more user-friendly way to find files in Drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YDI14ueZShyo9kG_sFgJ33nLa8g=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093358/Screenshot_2021_11_04_144152.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSa9YZ"&gt;Google is preparing to beta test new search filters in Google Drive, which will hopefully make it easier to find the exact file you’re looking for. Dubbed “search chips,” the feature adds a line of filters to the top of the Drive interface, letting you limit your search by things like file type, last modification date, or which other users are associated with a specific file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hC5Iv"&gt;Google Drive already has some search filtering options, but they’re relatively basic and hidden in a sub-menu in the search bar. In contrast, the new search chips are presented front and center, and they look set to offer a wider range of filtering options. A similar feature was introduced in Gmail &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2020/02/gmail-search-chips-ga.html"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3ApmP"&gt;If you’d like to try out the new Drive search chips beta, Google is directing interested users toward &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdAt17W4xOOtCQesdFcCv301YAUBGirv1dkafdXucYeJUgR8A/viewform"&gt;this sign-up form&lt;/a&gt;. Search chips will eventually be available to all Google Workspace users, including G Suite Basic and Business customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FDA’s crackdown on unproven stem cell therapies isn’t working</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="human stem cell - Ryddragyn (wikimedia commons)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KCiImcfgHj7dxPpWGBtxEpQ5ac=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093354/1024px-Humanstemcell.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A human stem cell.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ePkPlg"&gt;In 2019, the Food and Drug Administration won &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/health/stem-cells-fda.html"&gt;a major victory&lt;/a&gt; when a judge shut down a clinic in Florida claiming to treat everything from back problems to heart diseases with stem cells. The decision was additional juice for the FDA to regulate the growing industry, which sells risky, unproven stem cell procedures as cure-alls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxwuXW"&gt;But despite the high-profile success in Florida, the problem has gotten worse. There are more than four times as many businesses in the United States advertising unproven stem cell therapies now than there were four years ago, according to &lt;a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stem.2021.10.008"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Cell Stem Cell &lt;/em&gt;that used online searches and Google Maps to find clinics. That’s despite a common perception that there’s been an FDA crackdown on the clinics offering these procedures, says study author Leigh Turner, a professor of health, society and behavior at the University of California, Irvine. As Turner sees it, with nearly 1,500 businesses operating 2,754 stem cell treatment clinics&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;in the US in March 2021,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;whatever warnings regulators have issued to try and rein in the industry aren’t working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8lITk"&gt;“It kind of raises the question, is there really meaningful regulatory oversight at all?” Turner says. “There is on the books, but in reality, does it exist?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbC0CQ"&gt;Stem cell therapy, a broad term covering any treatments that use specialized cells that can morph into any cell type, has some real, evidence-based applications. Stem cells are used to treat some blood cancers, for example. There are efforts to develop stem cell-based treatments for conditions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12059618/als-spinal-cord-stem-cell-injection-surgery-trial"&gt;amyotrophic lateral sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;, and stem cells from patients in need of an organ transplant have been used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4286776/hannah-warren-first-child-bioengineered-windpipe-transplant"&gt;bioengineer one&lt;/a&gt;, lowering the risk of rejection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFyO0A"&gt;But most of the other ways people try to use stem cells are unproven, experimental, and risky. Medical practitioners selling these treatments claim the cells, which are usually taken from patients’ own fat or from donated umbilical cords, can treat everything from joint pain to degenerative eye conditions. There isn’t evidence to back up those claims, and the supposed treatments aren’t FDA-approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anu2Av"&gt;And the products have a dubious safety record. People have &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/miracle-cures-or-modern-quackery-stem-cell-clinics-multiply-with-heartbreaking-results-for-some-patients/2018/04/29/80cbcee8-26e1-11e8-874b-d517e912f125_story.html"&gt;gone blind&lt;/a&gt; after receiving unregulated stem cell treatments. Non-FDA-approved treatments have also been linked to &lt;a href="https://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/21/7/1218.long"&gt;kidney failure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/wr/mm6750a5.htm?s_cid=mm6750a5_w#T1_down"&gt;bacterial infections&lt;/a&gt;. Unproven and potentially dangerous therapies have become so prevalent that in 2019, Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20853185/google-stop-ads-unproven-experimental-medical-techniques-stem-cell-therapy-moderation"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would ban ads for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfFyVD"&gt;Many of the clinics promoting stem cell therapies argue that repurposing someone’s own cells does not qualify as a new drug product, meaning they don’t need FDA approval. But the FDA says the cells are processed and manipulated enough that they become a biological drug product that the agency has to oversee — an interpretation that was affirmed by the 2019 case in Florida. In addition to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/health/stem-cells-fda.html"&gt;winning the case&lt;/a&gt; to shut down the Florida clinic, over the last few years, the agency has &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/enforcement-actions-cber/bimoteam-biologicsinternet-surveillanceother"&gt;sent letters&lt;/a&gt; to dozens of businesses warning them that the stem cells they use need approval before they’re marketed. The Federal Trade Commission and states attorneys general have also &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/182-3125/stem-cell-institute-america-llc"&gt;sued clinics&lt;/a&gt; over deceptive advertisements for claiming they can treat diseases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFMprs"&gt;These high-profile actions haven’t stopped the clinics from proliferating. There were only 351 businesses selling unproven stem cell therapies in the US in 2016 when Turner first investigated the matter. Now, according to his updated analysis, there are around 700 claiming to treat orthopedic injuries alone. Nearly 100 businesses say they can use stem cells to treat erectile dysfunction, and 23 say they use stem cells for autism spectrum disorder — and that they administer them to children. Most clinics included in the analysis didn’t list prices, but of those that did, the average cost was $5,118. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdcIAe"&gt;Turner thinks the spike in businesses offering stem cell therapies might be because the practice became normalized over the past few years, even as federal agencies tried to crack down. In addition to stem cell clinics, the businesses advertising stem cell therapies included chiropractors’ offices, sports medicine clinics, and other medical or quasi-medical practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Feps"&gt;“There seems to be a kind of move that’s taking place where it’s not just a kind of a couple of rogue clinicians who are way over the edge,” he says. “It’s much more run-of-the-mill: podiatrists, chiropractors, and naturopaths have moved into this space.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBAa3W"&gt;Stem cell treatments are profitable. The barriers to entry are low, and there’s a steady supply of people who are suffering from conditions that standard medicine doesn’t have good answers for. People with spinal cord injuries or chronic pain can be targets for businesses claiming they can cure these problems. And the rise in the number of businesses offering the treatments even in the face of FDA action shows that the odds of someone facing consequences are, on the whole, fairly low. It’s a risk many businesses appear willing to take. “I think some people see this as it’s an opportunity to make a lot of money,” Turner says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhPgJX"&gt;That could continue as long as the regulatory landscape stays the same. Experts have been waiting for the other shoe to drop for years, Turner says. But instead, things have gone in the opposite direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baQLWE"&gt;The FDA did not respond to a request for comment by publication. It’s not clear whether the agency will respond more decisively in the next five years or if the market for these products will continue to spiral, Turner says. “I do find myself wondering — when you have a marketplace this large that isn’t well regulated, can you ever get it under control?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Astronomers call for a massive new space telescope to find the next Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Laying the groundwork for the next few decades of astrophysics&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DMVe82"&gt;American astronomers are calling for the development of a whole new suite of grandiose space telescopes that will be able to peer into the atmospheres of planets beyond our Solar System, listen to black holes ringing as they form throughout the Universe, and look back in time to when galaxies first emerged. It’s all part of an ambitious long-term strategy to create the next generation of tools to study the most distant reaches of space, with the hopes of launching these spacecraft throughout the 2030s and the 2040s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BDTVG"&gt;Astronomers laid out their vision for this future in a report known as the Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics, released today by the National Academies of Sciences. Compiled every 10 years after extensive meetings and debate, the survey is essentially a wishlist, detailing the highest priority missions astronomers would like NASA to build in the coming decade. Decadal surveys of the past have led to the formation of some of NASA’s most enterprising missions, such as the Hubble Space Telescope currently in orbit around the Earth, and the James Webb Space Telescope, or JWST, which is set to launch into deep space before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5YzIca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Decadal team rose to the challenge.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOwq7s"&gt;Typically in their report, astronomers will provide a list of missions they’d most like to see move forward, ranked in order of priority. This year, the recommendations are a little different. Similar to past surveys, the new survey recommends building one big “flagship” space telescope—a behemoth that can see infrared, optical, and ultraviolet light in the atmospheres of planets that are 10 billion times fainter than the stars they orbit, searching for signs of life. But the report also recommends developing two smaller telescopes—one that sees X-rays and one that sees in far-infrared—almost simultaneously while investing in various ground-based telescopes and space missions already in development. They’re calling this pipeline the “&lt;a href="https://www.greatobservatories.org/"&gt;Great Observatories&lt;/a&gt; Mission and Technology Maturation Program,” and it would result in multiple spacecraft being built together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YtxTc"&gt;That way, in several decades’ time, astronomers will have an entire fleet of new space telescopes providing the most comprehensive picture ever of the distance Universe. Many in the science community are thrilled about that idea. “The Decadal team rose to the challenge,” Heidi Hammel, the vice president for science at Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, a consortium of academic institutions that operate major telescopes, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. “They laid out the awesome science, and they made bold choices, both for ground-based and space-based facilities. I am so happy right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jIhvsX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Search for Another Earth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UMlCko"&gt;The biggest goal laid out in the Decadal Survey — and the priority of its flagship space telescope — is finding and cataloging worlds beyond our Solar System. The first of these distant planets, known as exoplanets, were only discovered in the early 1990s. Since then, astronomers have cataloged thousands more, completely transforming our understanding of the cosmos. Now that we know exoplanets are common, scientists are on the hunt for one — or more — that might be home to alien life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8XZUn"&gt;The problem is that studying exoplanets is unbelievably difficult. These worlds are extremely far away, typically orbiting very bright stars that overwhelm them in light and wash them out. That prevents astronomers from seeing exoplanets directly. Instead, scientists must &lt;em&gt;infer&lt;/em&gt; their presence, either by staring at a distant star and waiting for it to dim ever so slightly — a sign that a tiny world is passing in front of it, blocking its light — or measuring how distant stars wobble due to the gravitational pull of a nearby planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tHNmgf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to discover Earths. We want to discover habitable worlds.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p6r03x"&gt;But just knowing an exoplanet exists is not enough to answer the ultimate question: are we alone? Astronomers are desperate to peer into the atmospheres of these distant worlds to see if they might resemble our own. The pinnacle of exoplanet discovery would be to find an exoplanet with just the right gases in its atmosphere, parked in a Sun-like star’s habitable zone — a spot where it’s not too hot and not too cold, allowing water to pool on the planet’s surface. But we’ll never find that if we’re stuck watching stars as they dim and shake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r7fmI2"&gt;With a giant space telescope that sports a 20-foot (6-meter) dish that can see in bright types of light, astronomers believe they’ll be able to finally see an abundance of exoplanets directly, including the ones that are just too faint to look at now. That way, we might be able to find Earth’s twin and perhaps even confirm the existence of life on it. “We focus our specifics around the scientific achievements that we want to see happen,” Keivan Stassun, a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt and one of the committee members who wrote the new Decadal Survey, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to discover Earths. We want to discover habitable worlds. That is a specific scientific priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kSMDTYKdtl8lwz_do8a8cttjmiI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985303/Starshade_Artist_s_Concept_2_PIA20911.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of what the HabEx telescope could look like&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8l3Gt"&gt;To design this new giant telescope, engineers will likely draw from two proposed observatory ideas that have already been sketched out in detail. Before completing the decadal survey, four teams of scientists came up with four different proposals for space telescopes, providing a framework for what future flagship missions could look like. Two of the four teams, LUVOIR and HabEx, proposed telescopes that could search for habitable worlds. HabEx called for a bold plan to build a starshade, which would fly in front of the telescope and block out light from distant stars, making their exoplanets easier to see. LUVOIR called for a monster space telescope that looked a bit like NASA’s upcoming JWST spacecraft, upgraded to the extreme. HabEx’s proposed budget hovered between $8 and $10.5 billion, according to the new survey, while LUVOIR’s was a whopping $17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BoUV8l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is the best possible outcome I could have hoped for”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNEQiu"&gt;The decadal survey doesn’t recommend building either HabEx or LUVOIR specifically. The report notes that HABEx wasn’t quite ambitious enough in scope and that LUVOIR was a bit over the top in terms of budget. Instead, the report simply lays out what the astronomy community wants these telescopes to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;, which should help inform their final design. The researchers who worked on these projects are pretty happy about the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZNDiX"&gt;“It’s absolutely amazing,” Scott Gaudi, a professor of astronomy at Ohio State University and co-community chair for the HabEx study, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It is the best possible outcome I could have hoped for, not just for me, but also for all the people that worked on these large mission concepts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZSfpGk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than One Great Observatory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1H7IWI"&gt;Searching for habitable worlds isn’t the astronomy community’s only goal for the next 10 years. It also wants to learn more about the densest objects in our Universe, like black holes and neutron stars, and the cataclysmic events that give rise to them. Astronomers also want to be able to peer inside distant galaxies right as they’re forming to learn more about how they evolve and birth millions of new stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-hLefnI2r6RrYIPcW_JzXPluK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985307/PIA16695_orig.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of a black hole, surrounded by a swirling disc of hot gas and plasma&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RjQNzM"&gt;It’s a lot to accomplish, which is why the decadal survey calls for more than just one new spacecraft. The authors say that the addition of an X-ray telescope and a far-infrared telescope will be the best way to achieve all of these tasks. In order to get everything they want, the report’s authors propose that mission planners get started on development of the big exoplanet-hunting telescope right away, sketching out the exact technologies they’ll need to start building the spacecraft. If that process goes well over the next five years, then it’ll be time to begin designing the X-ray telescope and the far-infrared telescope. All of these vehicles can then be developed and built around the same time. The two smaller telescopes would cost between $3 and $5 billion and launch in the 2030s, while the larger telescope would cost roughly $11 billion and launch in the mid-2040s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1NbN9"&gt;It feels like a bold plan, especially since space telescopes typically go over budget. NASA’s next big space telescope, the JWST, was originally supposed to launch as early as 2007 and cost less than $1 billion. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17627560/james-webb-space-telescope-cost-estimate-nasa-northrop-grumman"&gt;Now, it’s set to launch this December, and its overall budget has ballooned to $9.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Another space observatory that NASA is currently working on, the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly called WFIRST), also struggled with rising costs, so much so that the Trump administration tried to cancel the project. Both of these telescopes were considered the highest priority missions in previous decadal surveys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YgNM7E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When things take a long time, they are expensive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DY3VHR"&gt;The committee that penned the decadal report claims it’s making these recommendations with those lessons learned. For one, it argues that many of the technologies that were needed for JWST to work simply did not exist when the telescope was envisioned. “Doing that invention and technological maturation and testing and engineering — that just took a long time,” Stassun says. “And when things take a long time, they are expensive.” He’s hopeful that by getting started on the large telescope’s blueprints now, astronomers won’t be as blindsided by the technologies they’ll need to create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxfDtI"&gt;Stassun also argues that the staggered development approach will allow mission planners to do check-ins from time to time to see how things are progressing. If one mission is ballooning out of control, then it can be paused or tweaked while the others stay in development. That way, there isn’t one mission that sucks up all the energy — and money — in the room the way that JWST did. Most of NASA’s astrophysics budget was dedicated to JWST during its most crucial development years, making it harder for small projects to get significant funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhYOQk9QAweEwXW5ck1URTK0aRQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985309/right.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA’s JWST spacecraft, ahead of its launch this December&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DFQMZl"&gt;It might be a hard sell to Congress, which ultimately determines NASA’s budget and has been critical of JWST’s ballooning costs. But scientists are optimistic. NASA’s science budget &lt;em&gt;has &lt;/em&gt;increased over the last few decades&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Gaudi thinks people will be inspired by what these future telescopes could tell us. “We have come to Congress and the American people saying, ‘Look, this is fantastic science that can answer the huge questions that are going to inspire generations to come,’” Gaudi says. “And it requires a modest increase in astrophysics development budget. I think we can make that case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oUHyl"&gt;“NASA looks forward to reviewing the recommendations in detail and appreciates the steering committee and panels for their dedicated work to deliver this report,” the space agency wrote in a statement following the report’s release. “The survey will inform a compelling new chapter in astrophysics science.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qsMaSa"&gt;The decadal survey calls for more than just &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt; telescopes. The authors want to ensure that the people who are working on these projects are being protected. The report calls for a diversity and inclusion strategy for these missions, one that would make harassment and discrimination a form of scientific misconduct — a potentially career-ending move. And they also want the mission teams to be more mindful of how their work impacts indigenous communities and the environment. For instance, the authors suggest astronomers embrace remote conferencing long-term to decrease their carbon emissions from flying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbaXH5"&gt;There’s a long road ahead to turn these dreams into reality. But for now, astronomers are excited for what looks like a&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;bright future. “We stand at the threshold of a new golden era of discovery, both on the ground and in space: might we actually find evidence for life on another planet?” Hammel says. “This report — true to its name — lays out robust pathways to answer this question, and we can be the generation that answers it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5Yfo0o"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 11:30AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with quote from NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Autonomous vehicle company Aurora is now a publicly traded company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMwYOmbbnV1DVTAW4NEZGZstf_o=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70093237/_Aurora____Family_Photo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvnlNU"&gt;Aurora, the startup that was founded by the former head of Google’s self-driving car project, has officially begun trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “AUR.” It’s a significant milestone for the AV industry, which has struggled with overinflated expectations, missed deadlines, shuttered businesses, and a host of technological challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88RFrU"&gt;Last summer, Aurora announced that it would go public through a reverse merger with a special acquisition company, or SPAC, called Reinvent Technology Partners Y. Upon closing this deal, Aurora said it has $1.8 billion in “gross proceeds and cash in hand,” which will help its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMH9wg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a thrilling moment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Myc8xK"&gt;“This is a thrilling moment,” said Chris Urmson, co-founder and CEO of Aurora, at an event celebrating the company’s public listing. “It’s such an exciting milestone for Aurora for our partners, our customers, our investors, and the entire industry. We’re working to launch an incredible product in trucking. We’re building an incredible following product for passenger vehicles. And we’ll continue to build a long line of products as a broad grows over the coming decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DptlyAidZBgCuQ8Kp6EIlEFUlrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985464/Aurora___Pacifica_Texas.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SvEdGv"&gt;Despite a rush of SPAC deals among companies that intersect transportation and technology in the past year, Aurora is the first autonomous vehicle to go public by merging with a so-called “blank check” company. But it probably won’t be the last, with fellow AV startup &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/ford-backed-argo-said-to-choose-citigroup-jpmorgan-to-go-public?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Argo AI reportedly in talks to go public in a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxwTF2"&gt;Still, it’s a move that carries a lot of risk for Aurora and its founders. The company says it expects to lose money until 2027, with the next few years incurring the heaviest losses as it prepares to launch of its self-driving truck and ride-hailing businesses at scale. Aurora has said it wants to sell its hardware and software stack to other companies, rather than operate vehicle fleets itself.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="murIno"&gt;Founded in 2017, Aurora’s executives have deep and diverse experience with autonomous vehicles. Urmson, who led Google’s self-driving car project before it was spun off as Waymo, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/12/10/13905292/google-car-chris-urmson-new-company"&gt;started plotting Aurora in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gk95vw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company says it expects to lose money until 2027&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgf69p"&gt;He eventually recruited Sterling Anderson, who was the head of Tesla’s Autopilot team until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-push-to-build-a-self-driving-car-sparks-dissent-among-its-engineers-1503593742"&gt;he reportedly resigned over disagreements&lt;/a&gt; about Elon Musk’s push to advertise that the company’s cars would be capable of “full self-driving.” Urmson also tapped Drew Bagnell, a self-driving engineer at Uber after the tech company poached him from Carnegie Mellon (as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached"&gt;much larger raiding of the university’s vaunted robotics division&lt;/a&gt;), as a third co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBiVSZ"&gt;Since then, Aurora has been developing the hardware and software required to allow vehicles to drive themselves — a package of technologies that it calls the Aurora Driver. The startup already has deals in place with companies like Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358005/volvo-aurora-autonomous-truck-partnership"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; to use the Aurora Driver. Aurora also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;bought Uber’s entire self-driving division at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgl6Yt"&gt;Aurora expects its business to proceed on two tracks: self-driving trucks, available in 2023; and autonomous passenger vehicles in 2024. Both products will be available to customers via a subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4kcNw"&gt;Aurora lost $214 million across 2020 (with $179 million of that going to research and development), and that cash burn has only accelerated since, as the startup lost $189 million in the first quarter of 2021 alone (with $159 million spent on R&amp;amp;D in the quarter). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNBwfq"&gt;A number of electric vehicle startups, like Faraday Future and Lucid Motors, have also gone public via SPAC, as well as a handful of air taxi companies. (The founders of Reinvent, Aurora’s SPAC partner, also have a deal to merge with Joby Aviation, a California air taxi startup.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PglWQQ"&gt;Not all SPAC deals have gone well. Companies like Lordstown Motors, Canoo, Nikola, Velodyne, and others have faced federal investigations, company upheaval, and internecine battles after going public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqbqkN"&gt;But Aurora seems well positioned to weather the storm, thanks to a deep bench of talent and experience. The company has pitched itself to investors that putting money into a technology this expensive is worth it, though, because the startup believes the autonomous vehicle industry will be dominated by very few players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7WC58"&gt;“We will lean into our experience, our mission, and our values to deliver a technology that will save lives that will make transportation more dependable,” Urmson said, “and we will put Aurora’s mark on the world’s roads.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s 12th Gen Core i9 doesn’t need Windows 11 for AMD beating boosts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60xUCgvsWK0suYcVzmNdg5qPOKA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092872/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Intel’s latest chips fight back against AMD&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="vrz1DY"&gt;Intel’s had a hard time competing with AMD lately. AMD’s Ryzen Zen 3 CPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21552336/amd-zen-3-ryzen-review-roundup-5950x-intel-comparison"&gt;took the performance crown&lt;/a&gt; from Intel in gaming a year ago, and Intel’s response with its 11th Gen Core i9-11900K earlier this year was lackluster, to say the least. While it bumped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357949/intel-core-i9-11900k-review"&gt;some game performance&lt;/a&gt;, overall, it wasn’t enough to close the gap with AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X in both performance and power consumption. Some reviewers even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxiuvQPL_qs"&gt;labeled it “pathetic”&lt;/a&gt; and a “waste of sand.” Ouch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuSq4n"&gt;Intel’s 12th Gen arrives today and with it the flagship Core i9-12900K. It’s a new era of x86 processors that are designed similar to Apple’s ARM silicon in offering both performance and efficiency cores. This allows Windows to offload background tasks and keep the performance cores for the more demanding workloads. Intel is promising the usual “world’s best gaming processor” and a 19 percent performance improvement over its widely panned 11th Gen chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVnkE5"&gt;This new generation of Alder Lake chips also relies heavily on Windows 11. Microsoft has optimized its new OS for Intel’s Thread Director, supposedly allowing it to better manage tasks across these new CPU cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSgcFF"&gt;Intel promises better performance with Windows 11, but what does that actually mean in reality? Not much. I’ve spent the past week with the Core i9-12900K running on both Windows 10 and Windows 11, and there’s barely a difference between the two for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-HcvMrkDNlKb7rPlYumwt42LfQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957887/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Intel’s i9-12900K is slightly bigger than its predecessor. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="38116X"&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-12900K has a total of 16 cores, but they’re not the cores you’re used to. Intel has split them into eight performance P-cores and eight efficient E-cores. These performance cores are similar to Intel’s Core-class processors, with the efficiency ones more like its Atom-class cores. Clock speeds can reach up to 5.2GHz using Intel’s Turbo Max 3.0 technology, and there are 24 threads in total based on two threads per P-core and one thread for each E-core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RA7TQY"&gt;Intel is also offering DDR5 memory support for the first time and PCIe 5.0 support. This means you’ll need a new motherboard for Intel’s 12th Gen chips, as the company has moved to its new LGA 1700 socket and Z690 chipset here. You may even need a new cooler, or updated standoffs, as the 12900K is slightly larger than the 11900K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gJelu2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10845366" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQFd9n"&gt;DDR5 will usher in an era of performance and power gains and even a new generation of overclocking with XMP 3.0. Intel’s Alder Lake CPUs also include Dynamic Memory Boost, which enables desktop PCs to automatically switch between faster XMP settings and a slower mode with less power consumption. It’s still enabled at a BIOS level, but you don’t even need DDR5 for this new memory boost feature. That’s good news, as DDR5 modules are likely to be expensive for some time yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PUV9H"&gt;While you can buy DDR5 memory right now, some Z690 motherboards will also support existing DDR4 modules to ease the transition. The introduction of PCIe 5.0 is mostly future-proofing right now, as you can’t buy a GPU that supports this standard, and we’re still waiting on the first PCIe 5.0 SSDs to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="6zBZ3d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10845374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5oBYQa"&gt;Still, you’re going to find a lot of Z690 motherboards with multiple M.2 slots. I’ve been testing MSI’s MAG Z690 Carbon Wi-Fi, which has five M.2 slots in total, with four at PCIe 4.0 speeds and one at PCIe 3.0. We’re now at the stage where just using M.2 for your storage needs is viable, even if it’s still not very affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oksbts"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t review processors in the traditional sense, so we don’t own dedicated hardware testing rigs or multiple CPUs and systems to offer all of the benchmarks and comparisons you’d typically find in CPU reviews. For those, we’re going to recommend you visit the excellent folks at &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/intels-alder-lake-big-little-cpu-design-tested-its-a-barn-burner/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.kitguru.net/components/leo-waldock/intel-core-i9-12900k-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;KitGuru&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer’s Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dK4WDQ"&gt;Yet, I’ve been testing Intel’s Core i9-12900K paired with 64GB of SK Hynix DDR5 4800 RAM and Nvidia’s RTX 3080 Ti. I’ve been holding off on the Windows 11 upgrade on my main gaming PC, so I wanted to see if it was really worthwhile for Intel’s latest Alder Lake chips. Spoiler: it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SX5cwV"&gt;I’ve tested a variety of workloads, synthetic benchmarks, and games across both Windows 10 and Windows 11, and the results are very similar. Performance improved slightly in some multithreaded tasks, but gaming was practically the same. Windows 11 does seem to favor Adobe Photoshop and Premiere Pro workloads, though. I was able to shave off mere seconds in 4K renders in general, and Puget Labs benchmarks are slightly higher on Windows 11 overall. We run a standard video export test at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which exports a 5-minute 4K video using Adobe Premiere Pro. This completed in 3 minutes and 14 seconds on Windows 11, which was 8 seconds faster than when I exported using Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q3vE63"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10845364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80SQtt"&gt;In gaming, frame rates are mostly unchanged between Windows 10 and Windows 11. I tested &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt; all at 1080p with ultra or high settings. Performance was practically identical across all these titles, apart from &lt;em&gt;Gears 5,&lt;/em&gt; where it dipped slightly on Windows 11. A benchmark for 3DMark Time Spy CPU also dipped slightly on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEzpcw"&gt;There are bound to be improvements with Intel’s Thread Director on Windows 11 that are more noticeable when you’re running a lot of background tasks or just in regular day-to-day usage, but I wasn’t able to notice them during my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99DANU"&gt;I also tested a variety of PCIe 4.0 drives with the 12900K, just to see how capable it is at delivering the speeds you’d expect to see with the latest M.2 SSDs. Western Digital’s SN850 (1TB) is rated at 7,000MB/s sequential read speeds and 5,000MB/s write speeds. I recorded read speeds of 6,925MB/s and write speeds of 5,362MB/s. That’s only slightly better (less than 2 percent) than what I saw with Intel’s previous Core i9-11900K. Samsung’s 980 Pro also managed to hit read speeds of 6,706MB/s and write speeds of 4,977MB/s, all using CrystalDiskMark.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GATiEbwzWOqjUaLgDvXO5g7fZh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985227/HsBrxHu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Western Digital’s SN850 performs well with the 12900K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GVviRe"&gt;These types of speeds don’t mean much on paper, but in reality, I was able to do tasks like transfer 100GB of data between two PCIe 4.0 drives, all while exporting a 4K video without my PC bottlenecking or breaking a sweat. I use my PC for gaming and work, so it’s great to be able to leave a data transfer running in the background while I instantly load a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1Awo5"&gt;The Core i9-12900K also delivers big improvements on multi-core performance for benchmarks like Geekbench 5 and Cinebench R23. Intel’s previous 11900K dropped its core count to eight, compared to the 10900K’s 10 cores, and it suffered in multi-core performance as a result. In Geekbench 5, the 12900K was nearly 12 percent better than the 11900K in single-thread performance and a massive 137 percent improvement in multi-core performance. I also noticed Geekbench 5 performing worse on Windows 11 here. Likewise, the Cinebench R23 scores are a big improvement over the 11900K and even push past what you’d find from AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_xCcCodcpDa8ZoE6uWXm3qUfEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957888/tomwarren_corei9_12900K_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel is using a new Z690 chipset with its 12th Gen chips.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YTaAtp"&gt;In terms of the AMD competition, Intel is finally delivering performance that can outperform AMD’s Ryzen 9 5950X. The 12900K is a big improvement over the 11th Gen 11900K, in both productivity workloads and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vg4LQl"&gt;The 12900K beats AMD’s 5950X in practically all of &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-intel-core-i9-12900k-i5-12600k-review"&gt;Eurogamer’s tests&lt;/a&gt; and nearly all of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhI9tLOg-6I"&gt;Gamer Nexus’ comprehensive benchmarks&lt;/a&gt;. CPU reviewers have found that this performance comes at an additional price beyond the sticker, though. At full loads for certain tasks, the 12900K can draw more than 240 watts of power, compared to AMD’s stock 120W for the 5950X, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/fhI9tLOg-6I"&gt;according to Gamers Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkbsfZ"&gt;It has taken a year for Intel to respond, with a $589 processor that can match AMD’s $799 Ryzen 9 5950X. Whether you’ll actually be able to find it for $589 is another question, though. Pricing at various retailers in the US ranges from $620 all the way up to $649 right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDH3bT"&gt;Just how long Intel can maintain its performance advantage remains to be seen. AMD is rumored to be launching its Ryzen 6000 processors early next year, and they could be a stop-gap until the company is ready with its next Zen 4 architecture. For now, Intel is back and ready to usher in the DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 era.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House vaccine and testing mandate doesn’t start until after the holidays</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;The Biden administration on Thursday &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/04/fact-sheet-biden-administration-announces-details-of-two-major-vaccination-policies/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a rule that requires private businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested for COVID-19 on at least a weekly basis. This new push to bump vaccination rates comes after the White House set a rule requiring &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/federal-contractors-will-have-broad-flexibility-to-enforce-covid-vaccine-rules.html"&gt;federal contractors&lt;/a&gt; to establish plans ensuring their employees are vaccinated against COVID-19.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlHQLW"&gt;The new rule (&lt;a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23643.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) was drafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, a &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/workers/"&gt;government subagency&lt;/a&gt; under the US Department of Labor that covers about 84 million private-sector employers and workers. It requires that employers provide paid time for employees to go get vaccinated and ensure all unvaccinated workers wear a face mask at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ApcYu9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two thirds of all US workers will be covered by vaccination rules&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KXoJn"&gt;A second policy announced today by the Centers for Medicare &amp;amp; Medicaid Services adds a requirement for full vaccination of health care workers at facilities participating in Medicare and Medicaid, affecting some 17 million workers at more than 76,000 facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aM123K"&gt;There’s one deadline set for the federal contractor, OSHA, and CMS policies when it comes to vaccination: January 4th, 2022. Other requirements for employers, like providing paid time off for vaccination and masking for unvaccinated employees, take effect starting December 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpjAHl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22600423/vaccine-mandates-federal-state-google-facebook"&gt;Many private businesses&lt;/a&gt; — including Google, Meta (formerly Facebook), and hospitals across the country — have already required their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19 prior to the new rule. Some &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-workers-face-layoffs-us-covid-19-vaccine-mandates-kick-2021-10-19/"&gt;laid off&lt;/a&gt; small numbers of employees who refused the rules, creating additional issues for those struggling with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/10/16/hospital-covid-vaccine-mandate/"&gt;supposed&lt;/a&gt; labor &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/nyregion/nyc-police-vaccine-mandate.html"&gt;shortages&lt;/a&gt;.  An &lt;a href="https://www.osha.gov/coronavirus/ets2/faqs"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; for the Emergency Temporary Standard announced today notes it is a “minimum requirement” and says, “Nothing in this section prevents employers from agreeing with their employees to implement additional measures, and this section does not displace collectively bargained agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1rSPI"&gt;The White House vaccine mandate for federal contractors has been met with criticism from state governments claiming that this rule is unconstitutional. Nineteen states have filed lawsuits against the federal government, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-joe-biden-health-lawsuits-missouri-99fb3b040661c71ddde1ded37a2f5b87"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported in October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ2gNG"&gt;The two joint and two individual lawsuits argue that the mandate&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;violates the states’ Tenth Amendment rights and forces states to comply with federal law without intermission. According to the administration, “both OSHA and CMS are making clear that their new rules preempt any inconsistent state or local laws, including laws that ban or limit an employer’s authority to require vaccination, masks, or testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0PMDH"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total"&gt;70 percent&lt;/a&gt; of adults in the United States have at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but the US has the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/11/world/asia/us-vaccination-rate-low.html"&gt;lowest vaccination rate&lt;/a&gt; among wealthy democracies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The secrets of the first real smartphone, with Dieter Bohn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pB7XzuuQ2W_dyBR9idwQ47ncnxY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092618/Springboard_Thumb.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Our new documentary now streaming on your TV&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7F1VU7"&gt;You may have read on the site that &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn has been working on a documentary called &lt;em&gt;Springboard: the secret history of the first real smartphone. &lt;/em&gt;It’s about a company called Handspring working on, you guessed it, a very early smartphone. It’s a story that I think will resonate with the Decoder audience, so I wanted to sit down with Dieter and talk about it. He even brought an exclusive clip that didn’t make it into the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgNd0U"&gt;That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;documentary is streaming now on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s new streaming apps&lt;/a&gt; that you can get on your TV or set-top box. We have them for Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. We’ve been working on these for a long time. It’s a little more complicated than you might think to make these apps, make them good, and distribute them on everyone’s app stores. We learned a lot about usage rights and rival closed caption formats — we ran into some real Decoder pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZJPPa"&gt;But apps are cool, and you can watch your videos in 4K. You can also listen to this very podcast on our fancy streaming apps on your TV with glorious surround sound. And we’re going to start doing some exclusive videos on the platform, including the one I mentioned up top: a documentary that Dieter and our video team made over many months called &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DdqGhl"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP9354497182" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sDHy32"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMNSyG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Bohn, you’re the executive editor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; tell me about &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5UidF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a company called Handspring. This was one of the very early companies to try and make one of the very first smartphones. It had a storied legacy, it had genius founders, and it had a nonstop stream of corporate catastrophes that prevented it from being successful. The long and the short is the story of innovation and a scrappy startup trying to do something incredibly ambitious, but there were many reasons why it was not destined to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Alrqqg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We call it a scrappy startup, and it mostly was a scrappy startup, but at one point, it was one of the most successful and fastest-growing tech companies in America and American business history.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbGWff"&gt;That’s right. So the CEO was Donna Dubinsky, and they had launched the Palm Pilot, which you have probably heard of. And through a series of corporate acquisitions, they ended up being stuck at a modem company called 3Com. So they spun out and started Handspring and convinced 3Com to license Palm OS to them. And they launched the Visor, a PDA, and it was wildly successful, relative to other PDAs on the market. So they had a huge, huge initial rush of interest and sales, and things were rocking and rolling pretty fast for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VXXCaL"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Handspring Trailer|104173" data-volume-uuid="89d04bab1" data-volume-id="104173" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-485" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xeat29"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;They were early to the idea of a smartphone, and the thing they wanted to make was a smartphone. They had some major challenges on the technical side of building a smartphone that early. It seems like their bigger challenges were just finding a market, finding the right people who could sell this thing to other people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx9byV"&gt;The really interesting thing about the technical challenge, in particular, is the parts didn’t exist. They wanted to make a smartphone that had a radio that could handle data, and they just couldn’t buy it. It did not exist. The entire infrastructure of factories and supply chains that now exist in Shenzhen and Vietnam and wherever didn’t. So they ended up finding one company, I believe it might have been in France, that happened to make the radios that they needed. And they just had to cobble stuff together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPYumX"&gt;They also had to make bets on what actual radio networks would exist because there were all sorts of weird pager networks and other data networks. So they got through those problems, but then the question becomes, “How do we sell this thing?” And selling phones direct to consumer was not a real viable business. Everything went through the carriers. Before the iPhone, the carriers had absolute control over phones, not just which phones they decided to sell or not sell, but how they worked and what they were allowed to do from a capability perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNjFDj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the thing I end up talking about on Decoder a lot: the best products don’t always win, and there are often gatekeepers, visible or invisible, that are actually shaping the market. Even though they had the best phone in this very early category, they were gatekept out of the market in various ways, but it was still popular. People were still covering it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22278890/jon-fortt-cnbc-anchor-interview-gamestop-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Fort, who has been on Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he’s now an anchor at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CNBC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, he was a cub reporter at the San Jose Mercury News at the time, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is full of clips of his byline as a newspaper reporter. There was a lot of attention being paid to this company. Why were they not able to overcome those gatekeepers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldyhTK"&gt;A lot of it was those gatekeepers were more powerful than they were. Maybe not today, but there was a period after the iPhone where you could get something out to the market without having too much carrier interference. And Handspring did not live in that world whatsoever. They had a hard time getting the phone to sell in some European markets because it didn’t have a 10-key keyboard. The carriers didn’t believe that QWERTY keyboards would be popular and sell. Sprint did not believe that anybody would want to send a picture on their phone. They didn’t want that to happen because other phones couldn’t do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgnoQ5"&gt;But Handspring also faced a bunch of external problems. They made a huge deal to get a huge office building right after the market crashed. And that market crash caused all sorts of other problems for them, including an excess inventory problem from Palm, which ended up forcing the prices down on all PDAs. So their cash cow that was funding the launch of this phone went away. They were also constantly in the precipice of running out of cash, running out of resources. And they were on that precipice while everybody around them was actively fighting the success of this thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fKBssm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Springboard: The Secret History of the First Real Smartphone is out now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6PrU8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ideas that happened at Handspring, that company was reacquired by Palm, and then Palm did a bunch of stuff, those ideas are sort of everywhere in computing now. Where are the people? The people had long careers after the Handspring collapse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELKorP"&gt;A few of the key characters, Jeff Hawkins and Donna Dubinsky, went off to do the thing that Jeff always wanted to do in the first place. For Jeff, smartphones and PDAs was always a side hustle. His real interest is in brain research and trying to figure out how neuroscience and the brain works. And he has some unique theories on that. He finally went off and founded this company called Numenta, and a bunch of the Handspring people came along with him because they all really enjoyed working together. So they’re still over there doing that. Other players went to other places. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oTke5"&gt;One thing that’s interesting, this isn’t quite a Handspring thing, but you can follow some of the software history from Palm over to this other company, Palm Source, all the way to some of the founding team for Android. So it wasn’t just the Sidekick team that came over [to Android]; it was also a bunch of expats from Palm Source that originally were trying to bring Palm OS into the future that ended up writing some of the foundations for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhsTvP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just to be clear, the Android project at Google was an acquisition. If you remember the T-Mobile Sidekick, which was a phenomenon for a hot minute, the team that made the Sidekick founded a company called Android. Google bought that company, and they brought over a bunch of ex-Palm people as well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0HulD"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb1oI5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And that was the beginning of Android. That theme of “you have ideas, you get them wrong, you keep working at them, ultimately some combination of wireless carriers crushes you out of existence” is a pattern that repeats over and over again. But you can see the lineage is right there, and some of the core ideas of how you would operate a phone that connected to a network and was also a computer started at Palm in a very real way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="tw8kBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGzsbI"&gt;One of the people we interviewed is Rob Haitani, who was the interface designer for Palm OS and later at Handspring. He was trying to convince these software engineers, “This is how you make mobile software.” In the ’90s, no one knew how to make a mobile app. So he would have to be really rigorous about, “No, no, fewer tabs and big buttons. And it needs to be understandable. It has to fit in 160 by 160 pixels.” By the way, this was the screen resolution on these devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4J4Et"&gt;He got so tired of explaining how mobile worked to people, so he finally wrote a book that was based on the ideas that got attributed to him. It was called the Zen of Palm, and he had all these cones. So an example was how do you fit a mountain into a teacup? And software engineers would say, “I don’t know, you something, something, something.” “No, you don’t. You just find the diamond. That’s the one that goes in the teacup. That’s the only thing you care about. That’s what goes in your mobile app. Everything else can get buried in a menu.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8ClGR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m very confident lots of product managers listen to the show, I hear from you. We live in a world where a lot of this stuff is organized through our systems or competing philosophies of product design and product management. At that point in time, they were just very nascent. It was the beginning of thinking about how to architect computing systems and interfaces, and [Palm and Handspring] invented a lot of this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHRVmt"&gt;There were competing visions, to be clear. I mean, Pocket PC was a thing, WIN CE, I guess technically we’re talking about, which was a very Windows-esque interface. It had a start button, a literal tiny start button in the lower left-hand corner. And of course, Apple famously made the Newton, and that didn’t go so hot because it was also a little bit overloaded. There was General Magic — everyone has probably heard of that story as well. That was also overloaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTJAj4"&gt;One of the things that Palm figured out was you need to make the simplest possible app that can do the stuff that you want and don’t do more than that. They had an aggressive willingness to say “no,” and they were one of the first tech companies making consumer products who really evangelized the idea that you say “no” before you say “yes.” That hones your product to achieving the things that you want it to do and allows it to do those specific things very well. And then, you can start growing and making it into a more general-purpose platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7vM8D"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you mentioned Apple, and that idea about saying no is sort of indelibly associated with Apple and Steve jobs now. There is some connectivity between Apple and the Palm story.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9jbD1"&gt;Donna Dubinsky used to work for Steve Jobs. Ed Colligan, who ran marketing and later on became CEO of Palm, also worked for Apple for a time. So they had relationships with Steve Jobs. More than once, there would be a phone call where it’s like, “Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?” Maybe it is, maybe it’s not. And the pivot point of the &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; documentary is this meeting where Jeff, Donna, and Ed went to speak to Steve Jobs about getting the Mac to support their Visor PDA. Steve Jobs didn’t believe in the PDA. He didn’t believe in their vision. And Steve Jobs tried to present his idea of the digital hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ii1brk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is this phone call about Apple maybe buying Palm or Handspring?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X0wxKk"&gt;If you remember, he had the Mac at the center of it, and he thought everything was going to circle around the Mac. And Jeff Hawkins said, “No, Steve, I think you’re wrong.” And right next to Steve’s chart on the whiteboard, he drew his own chart with a phone at the center of it. This was well before Apple had been talking about the iPhone at all. And it may be that this was one of the things that convinced Apple, and Steve Jobs in particular, to get serious about coming back to the idea of mobile after walking away from the Newton because that had been such a mess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZmGnx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famously Ed Colligan, who was running Palm, said, “The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.” It’s quoted everywhere, and I know that you tried to actually get this audio, unsuccessfully. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FQEoaG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At the time that Apple was introducing the iPhone and other big companies were introducing their phones. You talked to him about that quote.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZI79z"&gt;Yes, I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dnnuF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It turns out at least one PC company figured it out. The other ones did not, but you talked to him about that quote. This is a little extra, it’s not in the documentary, but it’s just so fascinating to me. What did he say when you asked him about that quote?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oT6lCx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The PC guys are not just going to walk in and figure this out.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKKhTR"&gt;You’re right, it didn’t make it into the documentary because explaining the context around the quote was too complicated. He said it ahead of the iPhone announcement, but everyone knew the iPhone was coming. It was at a Churchill Club breakfast, and his contention is that he was speaking about the PC industry in general and that making phones was very hard. He knew just as well as anybody because they had been trying to make a smartphone before supply chains for any of these parts even existed. And he also understood, based on his history with Palm, that people had been trying to shrink PC interfaces into tiny mobile interfaces for a while. And that was the wrong idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNTfi"&gt;So his contention is that he wasn’t speaking specifically about just Apple. He was talking in general about PC people coming in and trying to make phones. So here’s what he said about his famous quote when I interviewed him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="77uNk9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Colligan:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s pretty silly, because if people actually go back and look at that interview, they’ll see that it was probably an hour long. And I thought it was really great, which is one of the sad things about it, that this one thing came out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHHXdx"&gt;But you know, what I meant by that [quote] I think was taken out of context. First of all, I’ve been an Apple proponent for my entire life. My entire career has been built on Apple products. My first company was an accessory company for Apple. My second company was an accessory company for Apple. Radius was an accessory company for Apple. So I’m a huge Apple guy and I always have been, so I wouldn’t disparage them. So when I use [the phrase] PC guys, if I was using that term, it probably was about HP, Compact, Dell, and whoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxowr"&gt;But even if Apple is included in that grouping, what I meant was that these are hard devices to create. And to really nail it, especially the radio side, it’s going to take some real effort. I didn’t say it was impossible. I just said it’s not going to be super simple. And in fact, if people look back at the original iPhone, it was actually a pretty horrible phone, day one. And it did take some iteration for it to get right. Now they had enough other compelling elements around it that people overlooked that, to a large sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2YO51"&gt;So they did really well. And I never, in my wildest dreams, would say Apple can’t create a product in this space. I would’ve never said that and I would’ve never felt that, but I probably just was saying, “Hey, this is a hard business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PHFIM7"&gt;You can judge whether or not he was right about that, but I think that, in general, the PC company that figured it out was Apple, and a bunch of the others kind of didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uR6xLy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bunch of them didn’t. Most of them didn’t. Microsoft didn’t. And that, to me, is the overall lesson here: you can have the idea early, you can even try to copy the idea, but actually executing the idea is extremely difficult. And one of the themes of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that is very resonant to me is that these things are very fragile, especially when they’re early. And the success actually might not be market success.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxLfGu"&gt;The subtitle for &lt;em&gt;Springboard&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;the secret history of the first real smartphone&lt;/em&gt;. We’re aware that Sidekick exists. We’re aware that Symbian was around. But Handspring had the vision for the way that phones should work today, and it was the clearest vision at the time, but that was not enough. You need to understand what the forces are that will prevent your vision from happening. And some of those forces are more than just “can you get the parts?” “Can you build a good product?” Some of it’s stuff like the carriers, stuff like “does the supply chain exist?” And so on. We talk about product fit. That’s a shorthand for a much bigger conversation of what could prevent your good idea from becoming a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5aWQk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This feels like a good place to stop and tell people to go watch this documentary, which is excellent. We premiered it at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s 10th-anniversary event to rapturous applause in the room — which was pretty cool. You can go visit &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/springboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;theverge.com/springboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. It has the trailer; it has the information about all the apps.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLyS2p"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I will just remind everyone again, we have new &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; streaming TV apps on Android, Amazon Fire TV, Roku, and Apple TV. Just go into the search box, type in “The Verge,” download the app, watch Springboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQVhSl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter, congratulations. It’s a great documentary.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="go97WQ"&gt;Hey, thanks. Talk to you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
