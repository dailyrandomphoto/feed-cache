    <title>Texas cold snap froze cleanup efforts at some Superfund sites</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NiWCTT"&gt;Texas’ deep freeze was the latest warning that extreme weather events threaten to derail efforts to clean up the most toxic sites in the US. In a worst-case scenario, a natural disaster can unleash buried toxic substances. But even minimal damage or the mere threat of a storm can stop or slow cleanup efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prRtP7"&gt;That vulnerability could become a bigger problem as &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/superfund-sites-climate-change/index.html"&gt;climate change&lt;/a&gt; brings about more weather-related disasters. For years, experts have pushed the Environmental Protection Agency to prepare for the onslaught. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBbhAh"&gt;“We have over two dozen Superfund sites here in our county, and we are one of the most threatened coasts in the world by natural forces,” says Jackie Young-Medcalf, executive director of the Houston-based nonprofit Texas Health and Environment Alliance. “As long as the waste remains in place … It’s at risk for impacts from Mother Nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="hIH48o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Superfund sites lost power or preemptively stopped operations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S3WTCZ"&gt;Efforts to control hazards at some toxic Superfund sites in Texas temporarily halted as a result of the deep freeze that battered the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; in February. Superfund sites are places so polluted that they were placed on a National Priorities List for cleanup. Several of these sites lost power or preemptively stopped operations during the freeze, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. At least four sites sustained minor damage like cracked pipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mV8OtB"&gt;After winter storms knocked out power and water systems, the EPA assessed 16 Superfund sites in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana for problems. The damage it found didn’t lead to any contaminants being released, the EPA told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9hSAw"&gt;But the storms did manage to freeze some Superfund operations, at least temporarily. One of the Superfund sites that Young-Medcalf’s group has monitored over the years, the Jones Road Groundwater Plume in Harris County, was damaged during the recent cold snap. The EPA found leaking valves and ruptured pipes and fittings at the site following the winter storms. The affected equipment will come back online after repairs are made, the agency said. And short-term lapses in operations at the site won’t affect the long-term strategy for containing or cleaning up hazards, according to the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vg7IH1"&gt;In the meantime, residents are anxious for cleanup operations to resume.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;“It’s certainly slowing down the cleanup process because the unit is not fully operable, you know, it can’t perform,” says Young-Medcalf. “What that ultimately means is that the plume of vapors that [the treatment system] was once extracting from is sitting there, largely undisturbed.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cnptmF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Disasters have put Superfund sites — and surrounding neighborhoods — in peril&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sS64T6"&gt;Jones Road was polluted by a dry cleaning business in a strip mall. Chemicals the business used from 1988 until it shut down in 2002 wound up contaminating nearby private water wells with tetrachloroethylene, also called perchloroethylene (PCE). PCE in drinking water has been &lt;a href="https://tools.niehs.nih.gov/srp/1/ResearchBriefs/pdfs/SRP_ResearchBrief_247_508.pdf"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a higher risk of epilepsy and cancer in people exposed in early childhood. Since then, &lt;a href="https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.cleanup&amp;amp;id=0605460#Done"&gt;cleanup&lt;/a&gt; has involved plugging up wells and pulling vapors from contaminated soil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16bG28"&gt;Disasters have put Superfund sites — and surrounding neighborhoods — in peril in the past. Hurricane Harvey’s flood waters broke a protective cap at the San Jacinto Waste Pits in 2017, releasing cancer-causing chemicals, dioxins, into the nearby river. Like many Superfund sites, the prescription for addressing pollution was to contain it on site. But after the protective cap failed during Harvey, the EPA &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/2017/10/12/242068/epa-announces-115-million-cleanup-for-san-jacinto-waste-pits/"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; to remove the chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oci2nR"&gt;“There’s not anything that man can make that is going to withstand the changes of this river and the forces of Mother Nature that go on there,” Medcalf-Young says. The issue now is that removing the chemicals from San Jacinto will take at least &lt;a href="https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2020/08/26/380447/cleanup-of-san-jacinto-river-waste-pits-now-estimated-to-take-7-years/"&gt;seven more years&lt;/a&gt;. And with storms growing stronger because of climate change, time is working against cleanup efforts. “Seven more years is seven more hurricane seasons,” Medcalf-Young says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aH13Nf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Seven more years is seven more hurricane seasons.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WCfJ8r"&gt;That’s one of the more daunting problems facing already established Superfund sites. Strategies to clean up and contain these sites were likely designed to address weather-related risks the location has faced in the past, says Jim Blackburn, an environmental law professor at Rice University. But climate change is creating new normals that remediation plans might not have taken into consideration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6DdMo"&gt;“We’ve seen 100-year rain fairly often around here. These terms have lost their meaning because we have so many severe rainstorms,” Blackburn says. “We’re facing something that’s changing going into the future. And I don’t think we’re very good at understanding how to evaluate that, address it, and plan for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMl2lY"&gt;Superfund sites are evaluated &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund/superfund-five-year-reviews"&gt;every five years&lt;/a&gt; if the location still has contaminants at high levels. That’s when the EPA will consider if any changes need to be made because of any additional risks posed by climate change, a spokesperson for EPA’s Region 6 office, which includes Texas, said in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnZBHC"&gt;“The Agency’s new leadership team is aware of the issues involved in climate change and Superfund sites, and will be working with EPA staff to determine next steps to build on the Superfund program’s existing climate change approaches,” a spokesperson for EPA headquarters said in an email. It’s a reversal from the EPA’s approach under former president Donald Trump, when leadership &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-s-epa-claimed-success-superfund-cleanups-climate-change-went-n1242435"&gt;backtracked&lt;/a&gt; on previous efforts to incorporate climate change into the agency’s work.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4EJ4B"&gt;About 60 percent of all non-federal Superfund sites are in places where they’re vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, sea-level rise, and wildfires made worse by climate change, according to a 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-20-73"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the Government Accountability Office. That report didn’t investigate how those events or other challenges might delay cleanup, but it’s something the agency is interested in looking into in the future if Congress makes an inquiry (the GAO conducts investigations at the behest of Congress).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWZ840"&gt;“You can imagine that if an area is flooded and inaccessible, that whatever cleanup might have been going on is suspended,” says Alfredo Gómez, director of natural resources and environment at the GAO. He says the agency would like to look into what kinds of challenges affect the pace and scheduling of Superfund cleanups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYg5GT"&gt;“Now we know that our future from climate change is going to be potentially affected by more frequent and intense storms,” says Gómez. “How can we still ensure that these sites are going to be more protected?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qCg48"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ55mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon Sound certification promises a big wave of hi-fi wireless headphones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYmtmgMJkh3S_NtAqBK-cxAZl80=/1x0:1365x909/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911041/snapdragonsound.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qLEf74"&gt;Qualcomm today announced Snapdragon Sound, which is what the company describes as “a chain of audio innovations and software” that work together to significantly improve audio quality when listening to music through wireless headphones, earbuds, and other devices. The goal is to deliver “high-resolution, wired quality audio, wirelessly,” according to James Chapman, Qualcomm’s VP of voice, music, and wearables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2fNbs"&gt;Snapdragon Sound takes advantage of the company’s latest processors, Bluetooth audio SoCs, and codecs like aptX Adaptive to achieve playback of hi-fi music up to 24-bit 96kHz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R54EyN"&gt;The concept of high-quality wireless audio isn’t new to Android; Sony has been largely pushing that mission forward with its own LDAC technology, which can transmit up to three times the amount of data that the standard SBC Bluetooth codec is capable of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UU7lYy"&gt;But Qualcomm’s components are found in headphones and earbuds from many companies — Bose, Jabra, 1More, Sennheiser, Audio-Technica, Anker, and more — and the Snapdragon Sound badge will appear on the boxes of both audio products and smartphones that support this HD audio chain. Existing devices won’t be updated to support it; the first Snapdragon Sound products are expected in the next few months. Xiaomi and Audio-Technica have been announced as the first two Snapdragon Sound partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pP2FQr"&gt;Aside from making it easier to enjoy hi-res music, Qualcomm says Snapdragon Sound focuses on improved, clearer voice call quality and lower latency when playing games — down to 89 milliseconds. Connection stability is also a priority, with the company promising minimal dropouts and glitches even in the busiest wireless signal environments. Qualcomm claims “Snapdragon Sound optimized devices will be tested for interoperability in Qualcomm Technologies’ dedicated test facility on measures of performance including audio quality, latency, and robust connectivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqn2d3"&gt;One thing that Snapdragon Sound &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; particularly focus on is multipoint pairing for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. The feature has become fairly common for wireless headphones, but Jabra is pretty much the lone earbud maker to offer it. We’ll have to see if that changes with this next wave of products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx0o6W"&gt;Today’s announcement of Snapdragon Sound follows Spotify’s recent news that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;it will offer a lossless streaming tier&lt;/a&gt; later this year as an add-on for Premium subscribers. Amazon Music already offers an HD streaming option, as do Tidal, Qobuz, and other music services. Good audio is always heavily dependent on the source, so you’ll need one of those services to get the most from Snapdragon Sound when it begins reaching products. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is close to building a second EV battery factory in the US, report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N0CX5e2S7xUWZMalojRtjHnI3UI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68911011/acastro_200406_1777_gm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOfyP1"&gt;General Motors is considering building a second battery factory in the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-looking-to-build-second-battery-factory-in-u-s-11614853806?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, in order to ramp up its production of electric vehicles in the interest of becoming a completely &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIwiS0"&gt;The factory would be built in collaboration with LG Chem, the South Korean battery maker that is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996866/gm-lg-ev-electric-vehicle-battery-joint-venture-chem-lordstown"&gt;working with GM on a battery factory&lt;/a&gt; in northern Ohio. According to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, the second facility is likely to be located in Tennessee, though a final location has yet to be selected. A spokesperson for GM confirmed that a second factory is being discussed with LG Chem, and a decision is expected sometime in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJHAu6"&gt;GM announced the construction of its first battery factory in December 2019. The automaker set up a joint venture with LG Chem, with the two companies committing to spend $2.3 billion on a new facility located in Lordstown, Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aRH7Kl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;GM is increasingly staking its future on electric vehicles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Gb0hh"&gt;GM, the largest automaker in North America based on sales, is increasingly staking its future on electric vehicles. The company has vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025, more than two-thirds of which will be available in North America. GM even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;redesigned its logo&lt;/a&gt; to look more like an electrical plug to emphasize its pivot to battery-powered vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h3nEL"&gt;LG Chem is a major supplier of lithium-ion batteries to automakers like Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and their respective parent companies Volkswagen Group and Daimler. Many of these automotive giants have plans to either build their own battery factories in the future or partner with suppliers to build batteries together, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/11/18305976/tesla-panasonic-gigafactory-batteries-model-3"&gt;Tesla does with Panasonic&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has also announced plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;bring its future battery production in-house&lt;/a&gt;, and it recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fe50829f-045b-4134-9089-4b650c544d91"&gt;a deal with a major producer of nickel&lt;/a&gt;. But until those factories are built, they’re at the mercy of suppliers like LG Chem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSBkAh"&gt;The auto industry as a whole is slowly shifting to electric vehicles, and if the US wants to compete with the rest of the world, it needs to ramp up its supply of locally produced EV batteries in addition to other crucial components in the supply chain. SK Innovation, another South Korean company that supplies batteries to Volkswagen and Ford, began construction on its second US-based factory in July in Georgia with production aimed for 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQeuV5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;President Joe Biden recently signed a series of executive orders&lt;/a&gt; aimed at combating climate change, including the electrification of the federal government’s fleet of vehicles. The new administration has provided an opportunity for GM to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220574/gm-new-logo-electric-vehicle-brand-ces-2021"&gt;fully embrace the electrification of its vehicle lineup&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;shrug off its past support&lt;/a&gt; of former President Donald Trump’s effort to allow passenger vehicles to pollute more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t232rf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Pacific Rim’s sci-fi world was transformed into a Netflix anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pacific Rim: The Black" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRBQS54mI2_gXFj_5EjH7uit2mI=/240x0:1680x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910974/PRA101_63_003_00.0101.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ie9d8b"&gt;Yuki Moriyama still remembers the first time he saw &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt;. He was a bit of a latecomer, and he ended up catching it in theaters with some friends who had already seen the movie multiple times. It wasn’t long before Moriyama — an art director at animation studio Polygon Pictures — was hooked as well. “It’s the type of film that, once you get into it, it becomes quite addictive,” he says of the straightforward mech vs. kaiju battles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkdNV5"&gt;Now, Moriyama and the team at Polygon are releasing their own take on the franchise. Created in collaboration with Legendary Television and writers Greg Johnson and Craig Kyle, &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black&lt;/em&gt; is an animated series on Netflix that explores a new time period. It’s set after the two films and takes place in a version of Australia that has been largely abandoned and is now overrun with terrifying kaiju. The series had to change in some ways — but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/22/17151908/pacific-rim-uprising-movie-review-john-boyega-scott-eastwood-cailee-spaeny"&gt;the action-heavy core&lt;/a&gt; that first inspired Moriyama is still there. “Every battle is an unrefined, unrelenting, fist fight,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8RvaZ"&gt;Polygon is a prolific studio, best known for its 3D anime style. The studio has worked on adaptations of everything from &lt;em&gt;Ghost in the Shell&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt;. The team even has experience with giant monsters, having created a trilogy of animated &lt;em&gt;Godzilla&lt;/em&gt; films on Netflix. For Moriyama, there’s one thing in particular that makes &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; stand out from the many other franchises about mechs and / or kaiju: the weight and scale of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3COCfo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7ntlaDS9OIA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KKv67P"&gt;“The first thing I think of when it comes to &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; is that the robots are insanely huge and heavy, and so they move very slowly,” he explains. “In order to pilot these massive machines, the human pilots need to make use of an unusual technology called drifting. I find it to be highly limiting for the pilots, but that’s what makes the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; universe what it is. I can thoroughly feel the persevering strength of the human race as they fight for survival time and time again, barely outlasting the kaiju every time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BRh9qF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no doubt that people are exhausted at this point.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y3lyJH"&gt;One of the challenges for &lt;em&gt;The Black&lt;/em&gt; was figuring out how to translate that aesthetic from live action to anime, while also carving out a distinct space in the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; universe. The show takes place in the future, but because of the almost post-apocalyptic setting, it’s not necessarily a more advanced world. Similarly, while the films focus on well-trained pilots, &lt;em&gt;The Black&lt;/em&gt; stars two siblings who stumble upon a training mech — called Jaegers in the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; universe — that they learn how to pilot. Put these aspects together and you have a story with a much bleaker vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPRdRg"&gt;“In the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; world, humankind has managed to thwart the attacks by the Precursors. However, there is no doubt that people are exhausted at this point,” explains supervising director Hiroyuki Hayashi. “We came up with the idea that the social gap between different groups would widen under these circumstances. Especially in the frontline areas left behind, people would only see advanced technology when it is necessary. The people in &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black&lt;/em&gt; are survivors who have been abandoned by the magic of advanced technology. If anything, they are depicted to have a technology level closer to what we have today, except for the Jaeger technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yOWODt"&gt;The new creatures from concept artist Yuuki Morita are a highlight of the show. But they also presented a challenge, as the production team had to find a way to make those more realistic designs work with anime visuals. “I remember us racking our brains trying to figure out how to apply color tones to the designs within the limitations that exist with the anime-style look, yet still maintain the highly detailed shapes Morita had created for us,” says Moriyama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vj3Oqs"&gt;Hayashi adds that, because of the collaborative efforts between Polygon in Japan and Legendary in the US, the designs also have a somewhat international flavor. “It was interesting and gratifying to see that the concept of kaiju, born in Japan — although some may disagree — has diversified and developed in different parts of the world. This is what makes it really interesting to have artists from diverse cultural backgrounds come together to create a single work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmOGqd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim: The Black&lt;/em&gt; is available to stream on Netflix now, and the seven-episode series represents a way for fans to dig a little deeper into the &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; mythos — including those fans who worked on it. It’s still full of giant robots punching towering monsters, but for Moriyama, it was also a chance to expand on the ideas that inspired him so much. “It’s cool that we’re able to tell a story about characters and villains not at the forefront of the greater &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim&lt;/em&gt; universe, and this has led to a greater understanding and expansion of the world in my mind,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How YouTube failed the 2020 election test</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6lINLcPItrGlphoWYsFf91ZbBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910720/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uMlpWJ"&gt;Today let’s talk about a comprehensive new report on election integrity, and the particularly low marks it gave to one platform in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6WvZX3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5Nb0VR"&gt;The 283-page report, which was published today, is called “&lt;a href="https://www.eipartnership.net/report"&gt;The Long Fuse: Misinformation and the 2020 Election&lt;/a&gt;.” It is the final work of a coalition of some of the most respected names in platform analysis in academia and the nonprofit world: the Stanford Internet Observatory, the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, Graphika, and the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bJoKN"&gt;The report builds on work that the partnership did leading up to and after November to identify and counter false narratives about the 2020 US presidential election. It describes its goals this way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="2K9LCn"&gt;The EIP’s primary goals were to: (1) identify mis- and disinformation before it went viral and during viral outbreaks, (2) share clear and accurate counter-messaging, and (3) document the specific misinformation actors, transmission pathways, narrative evolutions, and information infrastructures that enabled these narratives to propagate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="27onbp"&gt;The hope was that by better understanding how misinformation spreads on social networks, the partnership could push platforms to develop better policy and enforcement tools to reduce the impact of bad actors in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ac7qrw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;no widespread fraud&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbcaHv"&gt;Reading through the report, there’s a lot to be impressed by. Foreign interference, which all but defined the 2016 US presidential election, played almost no perceptible role in 2020. After making huge investments in safety and security, platforms really did get better at identifying fake accounts and state-backed influence campaigns, and generally removed them before they could do much about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRQVJi"&gt;The flip side of this, of course, is that 2020 gave US platforms an arguably even more difficult problem to confront: the virulent spread of election-related misinformation from domestic sources, most prominently President Trump, his two adult sons, and a potent ecosystem of right-wing publishers and influencers. Perhaps the report’s most crucial finding, however obvious, is that misinformation in 2020 was an asymmetric phenomenon. The lies were primarily by right-wing actors in the hope of overturning the result of an election that, despite all their viral posts to the contrary, saw no widespread fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3u4ia"&gt;The report makes clear that the platforms did not &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; these lies to be spread. Nor does it seek to make a case that these lies spread primarily through algorithmic amplification. Rather, it places platforms at the center of a dynamic information ecosystem. Sometimes the lies were “top down” — fabricated by Trump and his cronies and then turned into content by partisan media outlets and right-wing influencers. Other times, the lies were “bottom up”: shared by an average citizen as a tweet, a Facebook post, or a YouTube video, which was then spotted by Trumpworld and amplified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9zd0ub"&gt;&lt;q&gt;YouTube serves as a powerful library for hoaxes and conspiracy content&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81oI6i"&gt;These processes worked to reinforce each other, creating powerful new narratives that ultimately fueled the rise of previously obscure outlets like One America News Network and Newsmax. And in all of that, there is plenty for every platform studied here to answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQQK4u"&gt;The report faults platforms for failing to anticipate and “pre-bunk” likely election misinformation; failing to examine the efficacy of their efforts to label misinformation or share those findings with external researchers; and often failing to hold high-profile users accountable for repeated violations of platform policies, among other issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PWBOQ"&gt;Still, in both the report and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKkaZI-EiiQ&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;a 90-minute virtual event&lt;/a&gt; that the partnership held Wednesday, I was struck by the unique — and, to my mind, under-discussed — role that YouTube played in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMoDuF"&gt;So let’s discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l4GWi8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uTcFEy"&gt;The day after the election, I wrote here about &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-youtube-got-played-on-election"&gt;how YouTube was being exploited by the right wing&lt;/a&gt;. Unclear policies, inconsistently applied, combined with opaque or misleading labels had made YouTube a playground for hyper-partisan outlets. Uniquely among platforms, YouTube’s partner program enabled many of these corrosive videos to earn money for their channels — and for YouTube — through advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CDyMsN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook does not appear on the list&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zWH1dP"&gt;The EIP report picks up on all these themes and more, fleshing them out with new data and explaining the special role YouTube played in cross-platform misinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JimiqV"&gt;Here are three key observations from the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4syyI"&gt;One, &lt;strong&gt;for misinformation narratives tracked by the project using Twitter’s API, YouTube was linked to more than any other platform&lt;/strong&gt;. For tweets containing links to misinformation, YouTube ranked third among all domains, behind Gateway Pundit and Breitbart. Researchers tracked 21 separate incidents, generating nearly 270,000 retweets, that pointed to YouTube. The next-highest ranking platform, at 17th, was Periscope; Facebook does not appear on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QI4ZJ7"&gt;This finding speaks to the way YouTube serves as a powerful library for hoaxes and conspiracy content, which can continuously be resurfaced on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms via what the report calls “repeat spreaders” like Trump and his sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aRIYxq"&gt;“It was kind of a place for misinformation to hide and be remobilized later,” said Kate Starbird, an associate professor and co-founder of UW’s Center for an Informed Public, in a response to my question during Wednesday’s event. “From our view, it was a core piece of the repeat spreading phenomenon, and a huge piece of the cross-platform disinformation spread.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpyD4G"&gt;YouTube disputes this conclusion and says its rank on this chart is more of a reflection of the site’s popularity in general than a comment on the accuracy of the information found there. Other sites, including &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, ranked high on the list because they contained information debunking false claims rather than advancing them. “In fact, the most-viewed election-related content channels are from news channels like NBC and CBS,” YouTube spokesman Farshad Shadloo told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPr1z2"&gt;Two, &lt;strong&gt;YouTube’s library of misinformation was enabled by policies that tended to be more permissive than similar ones from Facebook and Twitter&lt;/strong&gt;. An analysis of platform policies leading up to the election found that in August 2020, YouTube failed to adopt comprehensive policies related to misinformation about how to vote, incitements to voter fraud, or efforts to delegitimize election results. By the end of October, the only significant change YouTube made was to adopt a comprehensive policy about voting procedures, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAbgxo"&gt;Meanwhile, Facebook, Twitter, and TikTok all implemented comprehensive policies designed to thwart efforts to delegitimize the election. (In fairness to YouTube, the report’s policy analysis still ranked it above NextDoor and Snapchat, which were found not to have adopted comprehensive policies in any of these areas.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="piknU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;every platform struggled to moderate live video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PpRvLo"&gt;“YouTube lagged in terms of their implementation,” said Carly Miller, a research analyst at Stanford. “Things were able to propagate on the platform because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j18LfT"&gt;YouTube disagrees with this conclusion as well and sent me a long list of policy changes it had made over the past year, including some that were copied by its peers. “As we’ve publicly discussed, we don’t agree with EIP’s framing of our policies or our efforts,” Shadloo told me. “Our community guidelines are generally on par with other companies and we launched several products in 2018 and 2019 to raise authoritative content and reduce borderline videos on our site.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmVIx2"&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;the report found that every platform struggled to moderate live video in particular&lt;/strong&gt;. Some videos containing lies about the election attracted millions of views before they received so much as a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2MJD5"&gt;“All platforms struggle with labeling,” said Nicole Buckley, a research analyst at UW. “But in particular YouTube had issues with adapting to embedding labels in new forms … of content sharing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aUmlC"&gt;Ultimately, the EIP reached very different conclusions about YouTube’s performance in the 2020 election than YouTube itself did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BTyD7w"&gt;“This is a cross-platform, cross-media set of issues where each part of the ecosystem is leveraged in a different way,” Shadloo said, echoing a conclusion drawn by the EIP researchers. “No two platforms face the exact same challenges, and … interventions that make sense for one may not for another.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DseqDp"&gt;On that point, YouTube and the EIP agree. But for the most part, I have the same concerns about the platform that I had in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="izA8TQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="bKxX7Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Born in a Pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alice Proujansky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tXmGA"&gt;Alice Proujansky photographed her first birth when she was seven years old. “My parents gave me this little point-and-shoot camera that I photographed my sister’s birth with,” she says. “It was the first person I ever photographed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQrvg1"&gt;Now, Proujansky is a documentary photographer photographing stories of births and maternal health. When COVID-19 first hit New York City, where she lives, Proujansky wanted to capture birth during a pandemic. But in March and April 2020, hospitals and birth centers were restricting who was allowed to be in the delivery room with someone giving birth — for a short time, some New York City hospitals were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/parenting/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals-visitors-labor.html"&gt;barring everyone&lt;/a&gt;, even partners, and asking people to deliver alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nf7dl"&gt;Shut out of delivery rooms, Proujansky decided to approach the story in another way. Her project, titled “Born in a Pandemic,” included portraits of people in the last few weeks of their pregnancies and just after they gave birth. “Both pregnancy and also the pandemic are just really interesting in the ways that they point to inequities and pressures in society, and the way our culture approaches reproduction and women,” Proujansky says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh7hFT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrlY6H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this project start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjUpwc"&gt;For me, the pandemic started when the schools closed. I have two kids. It all happened really quickly. First, there was this thing happening, and we were wondering if we needed to keep our kids home. And over the weekend, that decision was made for us. It was clear this was a big deal. I’m a freelance photographer and a teaching artist, and everything was canceled. I lost around $5,000 worth of gigs in a week, and I thought, “Is my career over? Is the world over?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXWAAK"&gt;I started taking photos because I needed to. I was photographing the experience of parenting in the pandemic, and then I started doing these portraits. I wasn’t thinking about where they would go, but I just really needed to articulate something about what was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dxy1Fa"&gt;I had my first contact with Jailyn Ortiz, who was the first person I photographed, in May. Going to photograph her was so strange. I drove into the city and parked in Times Square, which I’ve never done in my life, and it was completely empty. It really had that apocalyptic feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g89MeZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pFdPX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pregnant woman wearing a jean jacket and a blue mask is photographed on a city street in front of a stone facade, framed perfectly at the center of three tall lancet church windows." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LktewuJoY31IGUtrblfRli0Nl0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342562/01_Born_Pandemic_0080.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On May 7th, 2020, Jailyn Ortiz, 21, was 38 weeks pregnant and living with her partner in a hotel near Times Square designated as a shelter for families experiencing homelessness. Her first baby was scheduled to be delivered by cesarean section the following week; Jailyn wanted an unmedicated birth, but her baby was breech. She feared she wouldn’t be safe without control over her birth; she knows several women whose newborns have died. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pregnant woman wearing blue scrubs and a blue mask stands with a hand on her hip. She is framed by a line of trees out of focus behind her." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLJjEUVtldZhmDuX0Q5lOj7PJ1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342564/07_Born_Pandemic_1398.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alice Proujansky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;On &lt;em&gt;July 14th, 2020, Sarit Shatken-Stern, a 38-week-pregnant mother of two, stands outside of Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts, where she works as a midwife. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A woman holds her sleeping infant son in her arms while standing in front of a patch of greenery." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CIogvrURHjV67UaL5RIWw1Od5LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342565/08_Born_Pandemic_0163.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="0b1VAZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did capturing pregnancy and newborns feel different during the pandemic than it usually does? How did your relationship with those subjects change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qK2Ep3"&gt;In one way, it was really reassuring to know that these things continue. And I also felt this kinship with the people who were pregnant and had newborns. The experience of having a baby is sort of similar to the experience of quarantine, in a strange way. Time feels very slippery and sticky. It also felt like a very animal experience. The pandemic made us realize we’re very animal, we’re very vulnerable, and I had the same experience having a newborn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgYvIC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You started this project in May and continued to take pictures of pregnancy and birth through 2020 — both for this project and for others. How did things change for pregnant people over the course of the year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqroPp"&gt;You have someone like Jailyn, who was pregnant and looking forward to her birth plan. And then it’s May, and the whole world changed. At the beginning, some people weren’t even able to have family in the room when they delivered. Then, the people I was meeting toward the end had most of their pregnancies take place during the pandemic. Starting in December, the first babies were born where the entire pregnancy was during these really strange circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QupGRR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veR68P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAyQp1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How were each of their experiences different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3Xhfr"&gt;With Jailyn back in May, we were outside, six feet apart, with masks on, and I didn’t go anywhere near her. But we were nervous — was that safe? Then she had a newborn, and I wanted to take some follow-up pictures, but she wasn’t comfortable even taking the baby outside. There was that feeling of constant fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYoLw3"&gt;Then, by the time I photographed my sister-in-law, Heather, her main concern was that my mother wasn’t going to be able to be in the room with her because she was due not long after the rules had changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2EYzG"&gt;And Sarit, she is a midwife in a rural hospital with severe PPE shortages. She was a frontline medical worker, and no one really knew what would happen if she contracted COVID-19 while she was pregnant. She was able to keep her baby and her two other children safe throughout the entire pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqG4xw"&gt;The pandemic was never going to affect everyone equally, and that was clear from the people I photographed and spoke to. I heard from a mom who was white who had a positive COVID-19 test while she was in labor — it was frightening, but she was able to hold her baby, and it wasn’t that bad of an experience. Another mom who was Black had her baby taken away. She felt that the nurses were not checking on her. It’s hard to attribute this to one thing, and I don’t have data, but people of color have been vastly more impacted by this pandemic, and it shows up in maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="8qxrmr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has it been like for the people you photograph to have a baby at such a physically isolating time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqd7c4"&gt;I have two children, and my postpartum experience was that it made such a difference whether I had people taking care of me or not. It made a huge difference when people would come by and drop off food or if I could see someone with a newborn the same age and talk about the minutiae of that particular week. That connection was really important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Dvk7"&gt;Right now, a lot of people are unable to get child care for their older children. They’re unable to have friends or parents or relatives drop by. Having a newborn is already kind of an isolating experience. It’s a really big mental shift to become a parent for the first time or become a parent of an additional child. You really need people around you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marshall’s Mode II earbuds are stuck between rock and a hard price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Marshall signature style and good sound don’t quite justify the cost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="acVZzA"&gt;Marshall, the British company best known for its thunderous guitar amps, has also managed to build a solid reputation for headphones and earbuds over the last several years. Though they’re a little overpriced for what you get, I like the Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones for their style and clever mini-joystick for controlling audio playback. But now Marshall is moving into the true wireless earbuds market — and it’s very late to the party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHfT2M"&gt;The new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marshallheadphones.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fmode-ii.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22312301%2Fmarshall-mode-ii-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mode II earbuds&lt;/a&gt; are priced at $179, start shipping March 18th, and aim to make up for Marshall’s tardy arrival with “phenomenal” sound, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and a design that feels right at home next to the company’s other products. As a first stab at true wireless, these earbuds get a lot right for the price. But that price is also probably their biggest downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Fvpbr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10374058"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="auOaC4"&gt;These certainly look the part of Marshall earbuds. The case has the same textured, leather-like finish as the Monitor II headphones with the Marshall logo proudly embossed on the top and a USB-C port on the left side. Open it up and you’ll find the earbuds, three LEDs to indicate charging status for the case and each bud, and a round, gold button inside the case for pairing. Marshall claims the case has enough juice to give the earbuds four full recharges. Since the Mode II can last for up to five hours of straight listening time, that puts you at 25 hours total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUEo3k"&gt;The earbuds have a matte black finish with a very prominent “M” on them; you’re definitely wearing the Marshall brand with these. They’re nicely compact and not as chunky as some competitors like the Jabra Elite 75t. Marshall includes four sizes of silicone ear tips in the box — including an XL option, which is nice to see. Some foam tips would’ve been even nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OihAHAN9vOOLueC47wJP_LjslKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343731/cwelch_210303_4458_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mode II earbuds are on the smaller side and don’t stick out of your ears too far.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rMAXWQ"&gt;Marshall’s signature control nub is a little impractical for earbuds, so just like countless others, the Mode II earbuds use tap gestures. The controls aren’t customizable, and unfortunately, you’re left without any way to directly adjust volume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JEhWGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left earbud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syHyNo"&gt;Tap once for transparency mode or to answer a call&lt;br&gt;Tap twice for voice assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek4kpU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right earbud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNiNgd"&gt;Tap once to pause/play or to answer a call&lt;br&gt;Tap twice to skip to next track&lt;br&gt;Tap three times to go back to the last track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JpwbMn"&gt;It would sometimes take a stronger tap than I expected to register some of these commands, particularly with the right earbud. Those firmer taps pushed the earbud deeper into my ear, which got unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="FKeoEz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10373625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6H7D6"&gt;I’ve also encountered some odd bugs with the Mode II, like one where the right earbud wouldn’t play any audio until I touched it. There were occasionally some noticeable balance / phasing issues with vocals sliding between the left and right earbuds. Those issues both seem to have been &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; resolved with the latest firmware update, but still pop up at times. Marshall tells me another OTA update will be released before the Mode IIs ship to customers to further smoothen out performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7go37"&gt;Bugs aside, these earbuds do sound quite good. I’ve been listening to The Hold Steady’s new album &lt;em&gt;Open Door Policy&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s a lot going on in some of those songs. The Mode II earbuds do a good job of keeping everything — guitars, horns, keys, vocals, drums — distinct in the mix. Upper-end frequencies can sound a little boosted on some tracks depending on how they were produced, but it’s nothing piercing. And the Marshall app gives you full EQ control if you’re not happy with the default “Marshall sound” tuning. AAC and SBC codecs are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XuNOA6UEwNNWYRmNcMY2mHZhZDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343732/cwelch_210303_4458_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marshall’s brand is on both the front and back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r99x27"&gt;As always, fit and a good seal are crucial to getting the best sound. And that’s especially true here. Even when I have the XL tips on, these are the sort of earbud that I need to twist into my ear just the right way if I want the most bass and a balanced soundstage. They never feel loose, but something about the fit can be a bit finicky in my experience, whereas I can just plop other earbuds in without giving it much thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpJsgY"&gt;The Mode II earbuds don’t include any kind of active noise cancellation, but Marshall still added a transparency mode in case you need to more clearly hear what’s happening around you. The best I can say about this feature is that it’s serviceable, but ambient sound comes through far more muffled than the airy, natural transparency modes of other earbuds. Voice call performance is average: people I spoke to could hear me just fine but noted that my voice sounded a bit hollow and trebly — something that was also true when I listened back to voice memo samples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IbPlSwiA94-_En4CkZ9VOmEK_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343727/cwelch_210303_4458_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case is very pocketable and supports wireless charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZA82hIXF3d7-m2oO4NTVMtAirc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343725/cwelch_210303_4458_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are separate LEDs to show charge status for both earbuds and the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JDJeY"&gt;Rounding out the features, Marshall includes auto-pause when you remove a bud, and they should be suitable for normal workouts thanks to an IPX4 rating. Like the vast majority of true wireless earbuds, these don’t support multipoint for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. But you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use either one independently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id4LWV"&gt;If the Marshall Mode II buds were priced at $130 or $100, I think I’d come away with a more positive overall take on them. But at $180, they lack any real standout tricks that would make me reach for them over established competitors. The case is sleek, totally pocketable, and includes wireless charging. Sound quality is good, but not to the point where Marshall thrashes competitors in the same price bracket. Plus, you can get a set of true wireless earbuds with proper noise cancellation by spending $30 to $50 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TlpoEj"&gt;Coming into the fold so late, Marshall really needed to turn the knob up to 11. But the Mode II earbuds don’t quite get there, and the style points count for less here than with the company’s wireless headphones, where the cool design is so visible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eve is rolling out Thread support to more of its smart home lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VIuqUowAQbDHjW3LT8hcR-7rikM=/497x0:5476x3319/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910245/Eve_Weather_Lifestyle_05_Fahrenheit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Eve Weather outdoor weather monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKD04N"&gt;Eve Systems, a maker of smart home products that work with Apple’s HomeKit platform, is announcing an expanded range of devices that support the Thread smart protocol. The news consists of updated versions of its existing smart plug, a forthcoming firmware update for the company’s smart sprinkler, and a new outdoor weather station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XGzaL"&gt;Thread is a wireless communication standard that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5900893/wireless-protocol-standard-nest-thread-group"&gt;developed from the ground up&lt;/a&gt; for smart home purposes and is designed to replace legacy technologies such as Z-Wave and Zigbee. Benefits of Thread include more reliable connections between devices, faster response times, and longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcxIB7"&gt;Though Thread support has existed in a handful of devices for quite some time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; is the first one to really make Thread a viable option in the smart home. It can act as a bridge between Thread-enabled accessories and connect them to the internet, which they can’t do on their own. Thread is also one of the pillar technologies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Connected Home over IP (CHIP) project&lt;/a&gt;, a cooperation between all the major smart home platform and device providers to standardize around an interoperable wireless protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlUlFu"&gt;It’s with that in mind that Eve is updating and expanding its device portfolio. The new Eve Energy, which will be available in either US or UK versions, is an updated version of Eve’s smart plug. It will support both Thread and Bluetooth and will be available in the US starting on April 6th and the UK starting on May 4th. The Energy is unique in that it can act as a repeater for the Thread network, letting it extend the signal to devices even if they are out of reach of a HomePod mini. In the US, the Energy will cost $39.95.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xxm9Ef9DkEmi4Nh_1G9Hu_cch6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341451/Eve_Energy_NA_Lifestyle_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest version of the Eve Energy smart plug adds Thread support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88btS2"&gt;A forthcoming firmware update will add Thread support to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Aqua-Controller-Sprinkler-Irrigation/dp/B08FBHCPPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.95 Eve Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s smart sprinkler system. Thanks to Thread’s greater range, the updated Aqua can maintain its connection to the network better than it could with just Bluetooth. Eve says support for Thread will be released in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3vcdI"&gt;Lastly, the all-new Eve Weather is a wireless outdoor weather station that allows you to track the exact outdoor temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure at your home. It is a replacement for the Eve Degree, a similar product that relied solely on Bluetooth for its connectivity. The Eve Weather has a monochrome display that shows the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions; the Eve app provides access to trends over time and more specific data. The Weather also has Siri integration for voice queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS4Mwp"&gt;Eve claims the Weather is IPX3 water resistant and is specifically designed for outdoor use. It runs on a coin cell battery which should last between six and 12 months before needing to be replaced. The Eve Weather will be available starting March 25th for $69.95.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_WUk-FSQSWCgtP-pS7A2OyRq4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341455/NA_Eve_Weather_Display.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Weather shows current temperature, humidity, and weather trends on its monochrome display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UquTwr"&gt;These aren’t the only products in Eve’s portfolio that support Thread. The company has already issued firmware updates with Thread support for its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Door-Window-Automatically-Notifications/dp/B08BDM47S2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;door and window sensors&lt;/a&gt; and European-spec Energy smart plug, and it says everything it has released since June 2020 has the hardware necessary to work with Thread. It is one of the first companies to really throw its hat into the Thread ring in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR1DIU"&gt;Eve is a unique company in the smart home market as its products only work with Apple’s HomeKit platform and don’t support Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or any of the other platforms out there. That’s different from most other smart home companies, which try to reach the broadest possible audience by supporting the most popular platforms, which often means Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The HomeKit device ecosystem is much smaller in comparison, largely thanks to an onerous hardware certification that Apple used to require and has since rolled back. HomeKit is also completely inaccessible from outside of Apple’s ecosystem, so if you have an Android phone, you can’t control Eve devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVbEWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eve is the first company to broadly support Thread across its lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJudZE"&gt;Eve Systems CEO Jerome Gackel told me the company’s goal isn’t just to be a HomeKit accessory maker. It’s just that Apple’s platform is the only one that allows Eve to focus its efforts on its devices and apps without having to also maintain a cloud service to allow them to connect to the internet. All of the processing for Eve devices happens locally on your home network or between your own devices, without sending data to the cloud, which helps the company achieve its goal of a privacy-first smart home. (You can still remotely control Eve devices through Apple’s Home app, provided you have a HomeKit hub, such as an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad running in your home.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSnn1J"&gt;Gackel hopes that support for Thread and its key role in the CHIP project will open the door to working with the other smart home platforms in the future. But Eve won’t work with Alexa or Google Home so long as they continue to require a cloud connection to their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQwXPW"&gt;Eve’s bet on HomeKit has been successful so far — the company already has 18 products in its lineup and claims sales of over 1 million units by 2019, with two-thirds of its customer base in Germany and the rest in the US. Its lineup for 2021 will make it the largest provider of HomeKit accessories, with Thread support being a recurring theme throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s new Light Strip can make your setup look more chill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6QrXZX4DPpnSZXfEMeDewkErHQ=/0x18:2355x1588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910194/elgatolightstrip.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who has an entertainment center this big? Wait — no, don’t tell me.&lt;/em&gt; | Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06YJpC"&gt;Elgato, the Corsair-owned company known for its gaming and creator-focused streaming tech, is expanding into smart lighting. It has introduced &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/light-strip"&gt;the Light Strip&lt;/a&gt;, a thin strip packed with 108 dimmable LEDs that can be mounted via sticky adhesive, bent, and trimmed to fit wherever you’d like them to go. These can be controlled over Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) through a free app on macOS, Windows 10, iOS, or Android, or from Elgato’s Stream Deck hardware, which apparently will offer deeper integration. Elgato is charging $59.99 for two meters (about 79 inches) of lights, including the controller the lights plug into and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKY4_kAkFJ_mCs1wJmFvXuWfJ0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343751/lightstrip2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stream Deck isn’t included, for the record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5LsWe"&gt;These are similar in execution to most connected light strips including Philips Hue’s, which ironically has tight Stream Deck integration via plug-ins. Not to be confused with the capabilities of something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418861/philips-hue-play-gradient-lightstrip-tv-mount"&gt;Philips Hue Play gradient light strip&lt;/a&gt; that can sync the light to what’s on your screen (only after purchasing some pricey additional hardware), Elgato’s more affordable solution is just for looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRzj5x"&gt;If you’re a streamer who appears on-camera, Elgato says the LEDs within the Light Strip are flicker-free. It says some other options appear fine to the naked eye but can create a flickering effect when you’re on-camera. In terms of other specs, these are RGBWW LEDs that offer both cool and warm white support, in addition to millions of colors. These have a 2,000-lumen maximum output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oF6noJ"&gt;Elgato, keenly aware of its target audience, is also announcing &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/wave-panels"&gt;Wave Panels&lt;/a&gt;. These are glorified foam pieces can be mounted (either by adhesive or with a wall anchor) in your space to improve the acoustics. They’ll likely be particularly useful if you’re recording your voice. They have an edgy look, and Elgato is releasing them in multiple colors. It’s $100 for six panels and mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyxPW3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 9:39AM ET, March 4th: Added pricing for Wave Panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
