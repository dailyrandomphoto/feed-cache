    <title>Federal court blocks Texas law banning ‘viewpoint discrimination’ on social media</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFGSLE"&gt;A federal judge has blocked a Texas law that aimed to limit large social platforms’ ability to moderate content on the grounds that it is likely to violate the First Amendment. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23057162/order.pdf"&gt;The order&lt;/a&gt;, issued by a federal district court in Austin on Wednesday night, granted an injunction proposed by NetChoice and the CCIA that puts the HB 20 law on hold until the conclusion of the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuWUTM"&gt;“HB 20’s prohibitions on ‘censorship’ and constraints on how social media platforms disseminate content violate the First Amendment,” determined Judge Robert Pitman in the decision. “Content moderation and curation will benefit users and the public by reducing harmful content and providing a safe, useful service,” Pitman said, explaining why the injunction was beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="jSfCQZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Private companies that use editorial judgment to choose whether to publish content...cannot be compelled by the government to publish other content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e71Zf1"&gt;“Social media platforms have a First Amendment right to moderate content disseminated on their platforms,” the order reads, citing three separate Supreme Court decisions affirming the principle. “Private companies that use editorial judgment to choose whether to publish content — and, if they do publish content, use editorial judgment to choose what they want to publish — cannot be compelled by the government to publish other content.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kLHlw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661626/texas-social-media-law-hb-20-signed-greg-abbott"&gt;The Texas social media law&lt;/a&gt; bans web services with more than 50 million monthly active users from removing or otherwise limiting content based on the user’s “viewpoint,” among other regulations that are aimed at simultaneously discouraging moderation of controversial posts and requiring faster takedowns of illegal content. It’s intended to fight what Texas politicians have described as unfairly liberal-leaning moderation on sites like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="v0Jh1c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Content moderation and curation will benefit users and the public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qU77dG"&gt;But crucially, the court found that this alleged viewpoint discrimination can be cast as editorial discretion, which is protected by the First Amendment. “Without editorial discretion,” the order reads, “social media platforms could not skew their platforms ideologically, as the state accuses of them of doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDYqa5"&gt;Judge Pitman also objected to rules that required publishing detailed moderation reports. The law’s disclosure rules are “inordinately burdensome given the unfathomably large numbers of posts on these sites and apps,” the order says. It also suggests that the law was intended specifically and unconstitutionally to target sites that politicians saw as anti-conservative, noting a failed amendment that could have lowered the user threshold to cover conservative-friendly sites like Parler and Gab. “The record in this case confirms that the legislature intended to target large social media platforms perceived as being biased against conservative views.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uu2kyC"&gt;NetChoice and the CCIA previously sued over a similar Florida social media law. That rule &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558086/florida-social-media-theme-park-law-preliminary-injunction-lawsuit"&gt;received a scathing rebuke&lt;/a&gt; from a judge who blocked its implementation in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HYaZ7v"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday may have come and gone, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t any AirPods deals to be had. In October, Apple finally launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third generation of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, introducing a new AirPods lineup and dropping the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level AirPods from $159 to $129. Since then, we’ve seen many retailers starting to discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even seen some of the first discounts on the latest AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UJyTOI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. Moreover, it only sells the model with a wired charging case, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. What’s great, though, is that this version frequently gets discounted, so you can buy it for even less. During Black Friday, we saw this model drop to as low as $89. While the price has since increased, you can still find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods discounted down to $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and $115 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0lrWhTzc2xyIWSIWPUxqHXoGUkG0HdVMNz%253A%253AT00%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;As previously mentioned, the newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems allow for a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model given how recently they launched, but we finally started seeing some significant deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday that are still available. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling the $179 earbuds for $150 at checkout, their lowest price yet. &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is also discounting the third-gen model, but only by $10 or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and comes with swappable silicone tips. In addition, they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713126/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-firmware-update"&gt;recently received a firmware&lt;/a&gt; update that added Conversation Boost, an accessibility feature for those who are hard of hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Additionally, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These start at $249, but you can buy them right now for $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or $200 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9zDqO"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still roughly a $50 discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 at Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are currently available in various colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThsYtSLBr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1610235-REG%2Fapple_mgyn3am_a_airpods_max_green.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; for $479, one of their better prices in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘notebook upgrade program’ could get businesses new M1 Macs for $30 per month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="From $30/ Month" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a0rqB5rVch510AifqGVWwXx3bWw=/0x130:1162x905/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217415/FFXiWQ5VgAcOtih.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mac notebook upgrade program marketing to apparent business partners | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach" target="_blank"&gt;@MaxWinebach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZaNwO"&gt;Apple has apparently introduced a business-only program that enables members to obtain and eventually upgrade computers for a relatively low monthly fee. A tweet from writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656"&gt;Max Weinbach&lt;/a&gt; shows an image of Apple’s “New Mac Notebook Upgrade Program” promotional material that popped up for a customer with access to a business portal (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GiahGV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The credit application makes clear this is all about the Apple M1 refresh&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXsroC"&gt;The deal appears to be in partnership with CIT Group&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;a bank for business customers where this &lt;a href="https://landing.cit.com/mac-upgrade.html"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for the program shares the monthly rates for different MacBook models — starting with the 13-inch MacBook Air for $30, 13-inch MacBook Pro for $39, 14-inch MacBook Pro for $60, and 16-inch MacBook Pro for $75. Apple did not respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on the details of the program, while CIT Group declined to comment, directing requests for information to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NuLRKU"&gt;The process as listed on the site begins with a standard business financing &lt;a href="https://m1refresh.directcapital.com"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt; — just sign the documents after approval, and then CIT will issue a PO to Apple on the business’s behalf. The application page is titled “Apple M1 Refresh,” which lays bare the intention to push businesses to upgrade from Intel-based Macs to their more powerful and energy-efficient successors. The information available does not clarify whether there are any minimum order amounts involved per organization based on size or the exact path to ownership of these machines if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJg6lb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;See this is something I'd absolutely subscribe to &lt;a href="https://t.co/QbhtGKGGua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QbhtGKGGua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Max Weinbach (@MaxWinebach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6No9A5"&gt;Typically, organizations with Apple Business and Education (K-12 or Higher Ed) accounts can create a purchase order for devices and accessories using a special Apple Store site. Apple offers these partners financing, but it usually would be for the complete purchase amounts (save for some small discounts). This new Mac upgrade program now gives these organizations an option to &lt;em&gt;lease&lt;/em&gt; MacBooks, though there is no mention if accessories or other computers will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3vcuiff_fxBpW3hsBmqFlDZw1bk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056895/mac_upgrade_program.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CIT Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;CIT Group’s offer for a ‘Mac Notebook Upgrade Program’&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u7iM1y"&gt;Assuming a small business with five employees needs five MacBook Airs, they could potentially have them for $150 / month (ignoring taxes) but would have to hold on to them for at least 90 days before being able to upgrade. Still, this means that instead of paying $4,995 upfront for the five notebooks, the small business could hang on to them for about 33 months before reaching the full cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPjfdS"&gt;This aligns nicely with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/14/22781752/apple-business-enterprise-mdm-essentials-cloud-storage-security"&gt;Small Business Essentials support package&lt;/a&gt; that Apple announced in November, enabling small startups to get running — and invested in — Apple hardware without spending a lot of money. It doesn’t look like this will lead to something for consumers like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9296849/apple-iphone-upgrade-program-announced"&gt;iPhone Upgrade Program&lt;/a&gt; Apple has offered since 2015. Still, small business employees who carefully eye the annual refresh cycle might get new computers more often.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubiquiti hack may have been an inside job, federal charges suggest  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRMNhx2Mn0wLTyaUcRPLIs163-s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217406/acastro_170621_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RVnR5s"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-employee-technology-company-charged-stealing-confidential-data-and-extorting"&gt;indictment from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; suggests that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti hack reported in January&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;subsequent whistleblower claims of a cover-up&lt;/a&gt;, were the work of someone who was then an employee of the company. The DOJ alleges that Nickolas Sharp, 36, was arrested on Wednesday on accusations that he used his employee credentials to download confidential data and sent anonymous demands to the company he worked for pretending to be a hacker in an attempt to get a ransom of 50 Bitcoin. You can read the full indictment below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTRmG1"&gt;The indictment doesn’t specifically name Ubiquiti, only referring to a “Company-1.” However, all the details line up. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22226061/ubiquiti-data-breach-email-third-party-unathorized-access"&gt;Ubiquiti sent an email to users&lt;/a&gt; saying an unauthorized party had accessed its “information technology systems hosted by a third party cloud provider.” In March, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;someone claiming to be a whistleblower represented&lt;/a&gt; the incident as “catastrophic,” alleging that the company couldn’t tell the full extent of the attack because it wasn’t keeping logs and that the attacker had access to Ubiquiti’s Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9C5BoJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The indictment says the scheme fell apart because of a ‘fleeting’ VPN hiccup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LkvP8I"&gt;The indictment says the company is based in New York, which &lt;a href="https://www.ui.com/contact/"&gt;Ubiquiti is&lt;/a&gt;, and says that the company’s stock price fell by around 20 percent between March 30th and March 31st after news broke of the incident. According to Yahoo Finance, Ubiquiti’s stock was worth $376.78 on March 29th and fell to $298.30 by March 31st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NFOqN"&gt;Perhaps most notable is the allegation that Sharp posed as a whistleblower to media outlets in late March 2021 — the same time a whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360409/ubiquiti-networking-data-breach-response-whistleblower-cybersecurity-incident"&gt;accused Ubiquiti of covering up the &lt;/a&gt;data breach’s severity, despite &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/"&gt;the company’s denial that user data was targeted&lt;/a&gt;. We also viewed a LinkedIn profile that appears to belong to Sharp and shows him working for Ubiquiti during the timespan listed in the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a503I8"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Sharp accessed the company’s Amazon Web Services and Github accounts after applying for a job at another company in December 2020. The indictment says that another employee discovered the breach days after Sharp downloaded “gigabytes” of confidential data and applied AWS policies to limit logging. Sharp was allegedly assigned to the response team meant to assess the incident, and the DOJ says he used this position to try and avoid suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ufbBZb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sharp allegedly contacted media outlets after the FBI searched his house&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hEUq7s"&gt;According to the indictment, Sharp sent an anonymous ransom email that promised not to publish the data and help the company patch a backdoor if he was paid 50 Bitcoin by January 10th, 2021. The DOJ alleges that Sharp released some of the stolen data when the company didn’t pay the ransom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhdZ05"&gt;The DOJ says that it was able to track down Sharp because of one tiny technical glitch — Sharp allegedly used SurfShark VPN to mask his identity while taking data and sending emails, but “in one fleeting instance,” his real IP was identified and logged as connecting to the company’s GitHub. According to the DOJ, this happened when Sharp’s home internet went down, and then reconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYpb1B"&gt;According to the indictment, this eventually led to the FBI carrying out a search warrant on Sharp’s house, where he denied using SurfShark and said that someone else used his PayPal account to purchase the subscription. In a final twist, the indictment says that Sharp contacted media outlets posing as a whistleblower &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the FBI searched his home and seized electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HndLO5"&gt;If Sharp is found guilty and the DOJ can prove that the incident unfolded as laid out in the indictment, it’ll certainly cast a new light on the reports of the Ubiquiti hack. The indictment alleges that Sharp started the attack using credentials he had been given to do his job. In March, Ubiquiti &lt;a href="https://community.ui.com/questions/Update-to-January-2021-Account-Notification/3813e6f4-b023-4d62-9e10-1035dc51ad2e"&gt;held fast to its statement&lt;/a&gt; that attackers didn’t access customer data, which doesn’t appear to be contradicted by the information revealed today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopify has a ‘textbook pirate’ problem, publishers allege</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="justice-blind5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FEyxhw4UTqHQQ3auSgWFz7AmXo=/0x5:1100x738/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217382/blind-justice3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2bIO5o"&gt;Five major publishers have sued Shopify over pirated learning materials like PDFs of ebooks and test materials, saying the e-commerce platform fails to remove listings and stores that violate the publishers’ trademarks and copyrights. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056830/Shopify_complaint_12.1.21.pdf"&gt;The lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, filed today in the US District Court for Eastern Virginia, claims statutory damages higher than $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4OQaT"&gt;The publishers — Pearson Education, Inc., Macmillan Learning, Cengage Learning, Inc., Elsevier Inc., and McGraw Hill — say in the lawsuit that Shopify “assists and profits from the online sale of infringing copies” of the textbooks and other products. The publishers also say that Shopify has received “detailed notices virtually every week for years” that identify listings selling pirated content and related store URLs but has failed to block sellers from using the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Q6j84C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“known repeat infringers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8v6XEY"&gt;According to the publishers, Shopify continues to offer services like storefront building, web hosting, and payment processing to sellers who are known to list pirated content. “Shopify furthers its business model — and bottom line — by enabling known repeat infringers in their continued infringement,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ML75FY"&gt;Shopify president Harley Finkelstein &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22417825/shopify-harley-finkelstein-interview-online-shopping-amazon-apple"&gt;has previously said&lt;/a&gt; that if the company sees storefronts that are infringing on a copyright or trademark, it’s removed. But the publishers say anyone looking at the storefronts, including Shopify, can see that they are dedicated to selling pirated textbooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpdryg"&gt;The publishers also say that Shopify’s failure to control “textbook pirates” hurts their bottom line. Illegal digital copies of textbooks are sold “at a fraction of the price of the legitimate digital textbooks, thus diminishing their perceived value and resulting in lost sales,” the lawsuit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="km9Ivn"&gt;Textbook piracy, in part, is driven by the soaring prices of learning materials and what critics say allows publishers to maintain a stranglehold on the industry. Textbook costs rose &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2016/college-tuition-and-fees-increase-63-percent-since-january-2006.htm"&gt;88 percent between 2006 and 2016&lt;/a&gt;, according to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. And though publishers have claimed that digital textbooks make materials more affordable, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/6/18252322/college-textbooks-cost-expensive-pearson-cengage-mcgraw-hill"&gt;critics say&lt;/a&gt; ebooks don’t fix the affordability issue because access sometimes expires after a certain date, or they can’t resell them to recoup costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix4RhC"&gt;Reached for a comment, a Shopify representative said the company makes significant efforts to remove copyright violations. “We have multiple teams that handle potential Acceptable Use Policy violations, including copyright and trademark infringement, and we don’t hesitate to action stores when found in violation,” said Rebecca Feigelsohn. “To date in 2021, over 90% of copyright and trademark reports were reviewed within 1 business day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghXsl1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 1st, 8:59PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to include a statement from a Shopify spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s $9,000 drone is now available to order ahead of a December 24th ship date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/712ucNjfiZORURpCFKd_uWuBtEw=/86x0:1022x624/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217237/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s new Airpeak S1 drone.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agoeMK"&gt;Sony’s $9,000 Airpeak S1 drone is now available to order, the company announced Wednesday. It’s expected to ship starting December 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUTuAE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526921/sony-airpeak-s1-drone-cinema-video-acceleration-flight-time"&gt;The Airpeak S1&lt;/a&gt;, which was first teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225758/sony-airpeak-drone-alpha-photography-cameras-ces-2021-announcement"&gt;in January at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, is targeted toward video professionals and is designed to be used with Sony’s mirrorless cameras. According to the drone’s &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1"&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;, it has a flight time of 22 minutes without a payload and up to 12 minutes with a “heavy payload,” such as a Sony A7S Mark III camera. Sony says the Airpeak is stable in winds of up to 44.7mph, which could be useful for capturing footage in windy conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NHJbfy"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnyUPbM9H7Q?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2mzFhY"&gt;The $9,000 price tag comes with two pairs of propellers, a remote controller, two batteries, and a battery charger. It doesn’t include a camera or gimbal, though, which means you’ll have to bring some of your own equipment if you decide to order one. There is a third-party gimbal from Gremsy that’s made for the Airpeak S1, but it’s also &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/accessories/p/gblt3"&gt;expensive at $2,199.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnNUXu"&gt;Sony plans to sell an optional $300-per-year “Airpeak Plus” cloud subscription, which &lt;a href="https://alphauniverse.com/stories/sony-electronics--airpeak-s1-professional-drone-now-available-to-order/"&gt;will offer&lt;/a&gt; “additional data storage, advanced geofencing options, and import / export of flight logs.” There will also be an “Airpeak Protect Plan” that covers accidental damage, but Sony hasn’t shared how much that will cost. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new G3x platform could usher in a new wave of Nintendo Switch-alikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LyH46o_IfUxc2SVcMJXvU0QLNA=/0x0:5625x3750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217068/Snapdragon_G3x_gen_1_Handheld_Gaming_Lifestyle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snapdragon G3x Handheld Gaming  Developer Kit. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Qualcomm&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SutTDa"&gt;Qualcomm is upping its investment in gaming with a new Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 Gaming Platform, which manufacturers can use to make Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck-like handheld gaming devices. The Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 is an Android-based platform designed to let you play Android games, stream games from a console or PC, or play games via cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jTm6l"&gt;The basis of the platform is the new G3x chip. It has an Adreno GPU, similar to Qualcomm’s existing smartphone chips, which will let you play games at up 144fps. It also supports sub-6Hz 5G, mmWave 5G, and Wi-Fi 6E for speedy networking. If you want to connect G3x-powered devices to other screens, the chip supports output to a 4K display or tethering to a mixed reality headset over a USB-C port. The G3x also includes the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313214/qualcomm-snapdragon-sound-announced-high-res-audio"&gt;Snapdragon Sound&lt;/a&gt; platform, which is designed to improve audio quality when you listen to music with supported wireless headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k2ZlTw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm partnered with Razer on a development kit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SxQovf"&gt;To help sell its vision of what it thinks the G3x platform can do, Qualcomm has partnered with Razer on a developer kit device. (You may have already seen the device, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809800/qualcomm-razer-games-console-handheld-snapdragon-g3x-developer-kit-leak"&gt;which leaked on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.) The handheld runs on the G3x chip, has a 6.65-inch OLED screen that supports 120Hz refresh rates, and has a 5MP webcam on the front so that players can livestream their faces while playing a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEXRcU"&gt;Interested developers register to get the kit through Razer’s website starting Wednesday. But it’s not a Razer device, the company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “This is not a Razer hardware announcement,” Justin Cooney, Razer’s director of global partnerships, said in a statement. “The Snapdragon G3x&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;developer kit is a Qualcomm device. Working together with Qualcomm in this collaborative partnership, we aim to bring more publishers and developers to the table and achieve our joint vision for creating the future of portable gaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kURfT6"&gt;It’s unclear when we might see actual devices from other OEMs. “We’re really just focusing on the developer community right now,” Qualcomm’s Micah Knapp said in a briefing with reporters. “The devices are really up to the OEM in terms of when they can go out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4RZ7G"&gt;Qualcomm has seen success with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21147912/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-vr-ar-xr-platform-reference-design-announcement"&gt;AR / VR-focused XR platform&lt;/a&gt; — its XR2 chip powers &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2020/10/29/oculus-quest-2-how-snapdragon-xr2-powers-next-generation-vr"&gt;Meta’s Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have to wait and see if the G3x ends up powering something similarly popular. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 is its latest attempt to hit a Windows on Arm home run</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EE9EPiueHWmXD11KCORtBB4vVzw=/469x0:5532x3375/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70217074/Snapdragon_8cx_Gen_3_Hero_Image.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MDxx2e"&gt;Qualcomm has announced its latest flagship chip for PCs: the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3, which, as the name implies, succeeds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21409500/qualcomm-8cx-gen-2-5g-chips-arm-window-laptops-ifa-2020"&gt;last year’s 8cx Gen 2 model&lt;/a&gt; and offers some substantial jumps in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6ra7"&gt;The 8cx Gen 3 is the first chip for Windows computers built on a 5nm process and promises up to 85 percent better CPU performance and up to 60 percent faster GPU performance compared to the 8cx Gen 2. Additionally, Qualcomm boasts that its new chip offers “60 percent greater performance per watt over the competitive x86 platform” — although the company is notably quiet on which x86 platform its comparing things to. Qualcomm also touts that the chip supports “multi-day battery life,” although again, it didn’t provide too many details. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GLYkkDJZ6z7xP-FTFhd0tTYDm6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23056637/Snapdragon_8cx_Gen_3_Compute_Platform_Chip.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fTFWEM"&gt;As one might expect for a major Qualcomm laptop chip, a major feature on the 8cx is connectivity, with Qualcomm offering support for its Snapdragon X55, X62, or X65 5G modems (depending on what kind of 5G capabilities manufacturers want to offer). Additionally, the 8cx Gen 3 will support Wi-Fi 6 and 6E for when you’re not out and about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT0NRu"&gt;The usual AI improvements are here, too: there’s Qualcomm’s Spectra ISP, which promises better autofocus, auto-white balance, and auto-exposure for videoconferencing, as well as noise and echo cancellation features for better audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fhSnb2"&gt;Additionally, Qualcomm has been touting the power and battery life of its laptop chips since it first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128630/qualcomm-snapdragon-8cx-announcement-technology-summit-maui"&gt;original 8cx&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018; the chips haven’t really taken off, outside of modified versions appearing in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro X laptops&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLmL1j"&gt;And those computers that &lt;em&gt;have &lt;/em&gt;shipped with Qualcomm’s silicon haven’t made much of a dent on the Intel and AMD x86 hegemony for Windows, with slow developer support and none of the revolutionary advances that Apple’s own Arm-based M1-series chips have brought to its computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ukoiwU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Qualcomm’s next-gen CPU for PCs will take on Apple’s M-series chips in 2023","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785181/qualcomm-next-gen-cpu-pc-apple-m1-competitor-2023"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DsBZKP"&gt;Maybe the 8cx Gen 3 will change that. But it’s hard not to feel like the 8cx Gen 3 isn’t anything but a stopgap when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785181/qualcomm-next-gen-cpu-pc-apple-m1-competitor-2023"&gt;Qualcomm is already teasing its &lt;em&gt;next&lt;/em&gt; next-generation Windows PC chips for 2023&lt;/a&gt;. Those chips, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229497/qualcomm-apple-nuvia-acquisition-cpu-chip-design-data-center"&gt;designed by the Nuvia team&lt;/a&gt; that Qualcomm bought for $1.4 billion earlier this year, are “designed to set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs” with leadership in “sustained performance and battery life,” in addition to offering a competitive processor to Apple’s excellent M-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAs1KJ"&gt;In addition to the 8cx Gen 3, Qualcomm also announced a new Snapdragon 7c Plus Gen 3 platform. Unlike its flagship cousin, the 7c Plus Gen 3 is still built on a 6nm process but promises up to 60 percent better multi-threaded CPU performance and 70 percent better graphics than the  7c Gen 2. Like the 7c Gen 2, the 7c Plus Gen 3 is meant for entry-level Windows PCs and Chromebooks, so it’s not quite as powerful as the new 8cx Gen 3. In addition to the performance boosts, though, Qualcomm is also adding an integrated Snapdragon X53 modem, enabling 5G on Qualcomm’s entry-level laptop chips for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXx0BO"&gt;Amazon has expanded sound detection for routines, as well as made Alexa’s prescription refill skill available to Amazon Pharmacy customers. The company described the changes in its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/?node=23689535011"&gt;Alexa monthly roundup for November&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes mentions the US rollout of Conversation Mode, and that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;wall-mountable Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt; will start shipping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22786975/amazon-echo-show-15-release-date-preorder-smart-display-alexa"&gt;next week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ois3Mv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696536/amazon-alexa-echo-recognize-sounds-teach-ai"&gt;Amazon first announced&lt;/a&gt; its plans to support custom sounds at its fall event back in September, but it doesn’t look like you’re able to program custom sounds just yet — Amazon has simply added two new sounds you can tell Alexa to recognize. With the new update, the device can listen out for the sounds of water running and appliances beeping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPQSrS"&gt;If you want Alexa to detect the chime of your dryer, for example, you can set up a routine for Alexa to send you a notification when your dryer has turned off. Previously, the device could only recognize dogs barking, babies crying, snoring, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17883428/amazon-alexa-guard-alarm-ring-smart-home-security-price"&gt;glass shattering, as well as smoke alarms beeping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bkHQih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can now say, “Alexa, refill my medications,” if you’re an Amazon Pharmacy customer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kibeqN"&gt;Additionally, if you’re an Amazon Pharmacy customer, you can now say, “Alexa, refill my medications,” when you need a refill on your prescriptions. Alexa will provide you with updates on when your medications are delivered, and you can also ask Alexa to call Amazon Pharmacy if you need any assistance. In the past, the ability to request refills through Alexa was only available to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-ways-to-manage-your-medications-at-home-using-alexa"&gt;Giant Eagle Pharmacy customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bkmLe"&gt;Amazon has also fully rolled out Conversation Mode for the third-gen Echo Show 10 in the US, something that it &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/conversation-mode-helps-interactions-with-alexa-feel-more-natural"&gt;started adding to devices in November&lt;/a&gt;. You can opt in to the feature by saying, “Alexa, join the conversation.” After that, you can speak more “naturally” with Alexa without using a wake word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqesLE"&gt;Amazon also notes that anyone in the room can talk with Alexa — they just have to face the device’s camera. During Conversation Mode, Alexa will respond if directly addressed and will also pause if it gets interrupted. You’ll know that Conversation Mode is on by the blue border that appears around the Echo Show’s screen. When you want to turn it off, simply say, “Leave this conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Matrix Resurrections trailer is all about change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-X1-fMVDra6Rr0MIQUb-NaStnA=/345x0:1568x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70216933/trinity_melting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgYs_NDyaLs&amp;amp;t=42s" target="_blank"&gt;Warner Bros.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Muw3RG"&gt;Let’s get something out of the way: this is &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; and if there is any movie we are going to cover the shit out of, it’s &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections &lt;/em&gt;— even if its new trailer is long on melting / morphing faces and short on clues about the plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQC179"&gt;The latest trailer, titled “Déjà Vu,” opens with a voiceover from Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) with a line from the first movie, when she explains that “déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.” That sentence repeats several times. We see a black cat cross Neo’s path just like in the first movie, and we see a series of screen wipes, moving between younger and older versions of characters, including Neo — in the birthing goo pod — Trinity, Morpheus (hi, Laurence Fishburne!), Agent Smith, The Merovingian, and others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhpKVJ"&gt;Like the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; trailer released in September&lt;/a&gt;, we hear Jefferson Airplane’s &lt;em&gt;White Rabbit&lt;/em&gt; playing in the background (there is no &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SocialKimLy/status/1435964170483093508?s=20"&gt;rubber duck&lt;/a&gt; in this latest clip, unfortunately). In case you didn’t pick up on the theme, the trailer helpfully shows the word CHANGE, while hearing a voice question, “Why use old code to make something new?” and another observe that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWZ4P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s managing editor encouraged me to blog my feelings about this latest trailer, even though I warned her the feelings would be mostly “lust and also more lust” because look, I am Gen X, and Keanu Reeves is our mascot, and I feel compelled to protect and respect him at all costs even in the worst of movies. This film looks like a fine use of his cheekbones and soulful brown eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8G92z"&gt;And this trailer probably should have been the first one released for &lt;em&gt;Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; because it reminds you of how much we missed the black leather-clad, hair-gelled&lt;em&gt; Matrix&lt;/em&gt; crew while hinting at a whole new direction. This is slightly off-topic, but it is sort of nice to see a few crows’ feet around Neo’s eyes as he looks around, bewildered, at the Matrix — much the way I expect most of Gen X would regard it were we ever to be unplugged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJalD3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on December 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nB11d0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
