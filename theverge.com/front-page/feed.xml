    <title>The Galactus event was Fortnite’s biggest yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HSZCjWQ04D7svm6bi0OxP_35zbo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68247701/Fortnite_20201201161314.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7whbvu"&gt;The season-ending live event that just took place in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; was the game’s biggest to date, Epic Games has confirmed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;The Galactus event&lt;/a&gt;, which concluded &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s current Marvel-themed season, had a record 15.3 million concurrent players, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1333954587879821314"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPGpzH"&gt;That beats out the Travis Scott concert from April, which peaked at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233946/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-record-breaking-player-count"&gt;12.3 million concurrents during the first showing&lt;/a&gt;. The record before that was the Marshmello show, which reached 10.7 million. Epic says that 3.4 million people also watched the Galactus event on Twitch and YouTube. The event saw players teaming up to stop the Marvel supervillain from destroying &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s island by piloting an explosives-laden battle bus to feed him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="atwHpA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite’s Galactus event was a giant arcade shooter — and now the game is down","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JlJxIr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is currently shut down as Epic prepares to launch season 5. Anyone booting the game right now will see a timer counting down until the next season — it’s currently set at just under six hours to go. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit’s secret-Santa-priced screwdriver sets have the bits to open a MacBook or Switch </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the two new iFixit kits, with a screwdriver wrapped in a bow between them" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ziOupAgNB1Kqta_9lL0ifwC4uc8=/246x0:1524x852/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68226433/hero_phase3_holiday_v12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;iFixit’s new toolkits are light on the bits, but have the ones that count.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: iFixit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C7tbbg"&gt;Following their sea creature naming convention, iFixit has released two new screwdriver kits: &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FMinnow-Driver-Kit%2FIF145-474%3Fo%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F1%2F21870605%2Fifixit-new-screwdriver-sets-minnow-moray-torx-triwing-pentalobe-hex-repair#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Minnow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FMoray-Driver-Kit%2FIF145-475%3Fo%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F1%2F21870605%2Fifixit-new-screwdriver-sets-minnow-moray-torx-triwing-pentalobe-hex-repair#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Moray&lt;/a&gt;. You probably know iFixit for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579016/apple-m1-macbook-air-pro-ifixit-teardown"&gt;their teardowns of the latest gadgets&lt;/a&gt;, but a number of &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writers also swear by their screwdriver sets which come with lots of exotic bits to open up electronics yourself. These new sets are their smallest and cheapest yet, with 16 and 32 bits respectively, and both come in under $20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45HFmu"&gt;Both sets come with the bits you need to take apart some of the most popular consumer tech: you can open iPhones and Macbooks with the pentalobe bits, Nintendo Switches with the tri-wing bits, and some PCs and older Apple computers with the Torx and Torx security bits. Both sets also include the basic Phillips and flatheads that you’d find yourself reaching for during everyday household maintenance, as well as the grippy handle that the included bits magnetically slot into, and a lifetime warranty. The handle also hides a built-in SIM removal tool, which could sometimes be handier than the stand-alone one that’s probably hiding in your drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A picture of the iFixit Minnow kit" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FaTF5kX3mjPk4UzemoKuDieY1RM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22135882/square_minnow_v1_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iFixit Minnow comes with 16 bits and a driver.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pVQHwb"&gt;The Minnow driver kit costs $14.99, and has a lot of what people will need if they’re just working on newer tech devices. For people with older gadgets, however, the $19.99 Moray may be a better fit. It justifies its $5 price increase by adding more sizes of the bits found in the Minnow, as well as obscure bits like triangle (often found in toys and vacuum cleaners) and Gamebit (for older consoles such as N64, NES and SNES, Sega systems, etc.). It may also be the choice for people who do some work around the home, as it includes a couple of metric hex bits that are used in everything from bikes to build-it-yourself bar stools from Ikea. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iFixit Moray kit" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0P6g56BzIrAZ-rxA5-jDtcBR5Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22135911/square_moray_v1_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moray comes with the same bits as the Minnow, but adds some more sizes and varieties.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aMZbeY"&gt;While the sets are relatively inexpensive, shoppers who are always fixing things may want to look at some of iFixit’s other kits, such as the $25 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FEssential-Electronics-Toolkit%2FIF145-348&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F1%2F21870605%2Fifixit-new-screwdriver-sets-minnow-moray-torx-triwing-pentalobe-hex-repair#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Essential Electronics Toolkit&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a lot of the same bits, plus tweezers, spudgers, and other tools that are useful for taking apart today’s glued or clipped-together devices. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FStore%2FTools%2FMako-Driver-Kit%25E2%2580%259464-Precision-Bits%2FIF145-299%3Fo%3D4&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2020%2F12%2F1%2F21870605%2Fifixit-new-screwdriver-sets-minnow-moray-torx-triwing-pentalobe-hex-repair#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mako toolkit&lt;/a&gt; at $35, which includes a whopping 64 bits and has an aluminum driver handle, as opposed to the plastic ones found in the Minnow, Moray, and Essential Toolkit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnJ4ul"&gt;That said, having more options when it comes to repairing your devices is a good thing, and the Minnow and Moray have attractive prices for people who will only need to repair devices every so often (or for people looking for a secondary kit to keep at the office or in a backpack). With the low price points, these sets seem poised to be popular stocking stuffers, possibly from family members hinting they have computers they want you to repair. I received my own iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit from my mom a few Christmases back as a (successful) bribe to upgrade her laptop’s hard drive. Since then, I’ve used it to keep all of my tech in good working order. And all of my mom’s tech. And my sister’s. And my wife’s. You get the point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo hacker Ryan Hernandez sentenced to three years in prison following guilty plea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IsW9uRG_T-4cgUgffZmXiUZ5Vc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68224124/jbareham_1492_170228_0097.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbwlpE"&gt;Ryan Hernandez, the hacker who pled guilty to stealing information about the Nintendo Switch prior to its release, has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdwa/pr/california-hacker-who-stole-proprietary-information-nintendo-sentenced-three-years"&gt;been sentenced to three years in prison&lt;/a&gt;. The sentencing follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117596/nintendo-switch-surprise-pled-guilty-hacking-department-justice-ryan-hernandez"&gt;plea agreement originally proposed&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020. In addition to prison time, Hernandez will also be required to pay Nintendo $259,323 in retribution for the stolen information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m304kY"&gt;Hernandez was first investigated by the FBI after he and an associate successfully phished confidential information from a Nintendo employee in 2016. The FBI requested that Hernandez stop all illegal activity in 2017. However, Hernandez continued to dig up confidential information in the following years and the FBI renewed its investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUd85L"&gt;A July 2019 search of Hernandez’s hard drives by the FBI revealed a stash of child pornography and videos of child abuse. Hernandez &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fnews%2Ftechnology-51358043"&gt;ultimately pled guilty to possession&lt;/a&gt; of the graphic images, and as a result, is now a registered sex offender. The judge overseeing the case recommended that Hernandez be placed in “a Bureau of Prisons facility for inmates with cognitive challenges” and afterwards that he receive a seven year supervised release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucPOP2"&gt;Hernandez’s hack is just one of several that Nintendo has suffered over the last few years. There was a breach by a security researcher in 2018 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18286027/microsoft-nintendo-vtech-security-hack-breach-researcher-guilty"&gt;leaked thousands of usernames and passwords&lt;/a&gt;, but the most notable is the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/26/21339018/nintendo-gigaleak-super-mario-64-zelda-pokemon-what-is-it-snes"&gt;“Gigaleak”&lt;/a&gt; of source code and development assets. Though the exact source of that leak isn’t known, its contents were a treasure trove of unreleased Nintendo designs, including an unused &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; villager and early prototypes of &lt;em&gt;Pokemon Diamond&lt;/em&gt;. But those intriguing looks came with a cost: the release of personal information from Nintendo employees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347074/nintendo-gigaleak-controversy-history-preservation-archives"&gt;making the leak an ethical quandary&lt;/a&gt; for archivists and historians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsU1jW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RzrR7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This incredible exploit could have let hackers remotely own iPhones without even touching them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UJHFzbfPORAAYR-qkIoV-bdJ0CM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68212519/B88A0099.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JjBW6I"&gt;Ever watch that movie, or play that video game, about the hacker who can instantly take over someone’s device without touching it at all? Those scenes are typically unrealistic as heck. But every once in a while, a real-life hack makes them seem downright plausible — a hack like the one you can see examples of in the videos above and below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JqRPWR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sTw7GGoJ6g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HKCIE9"&gt;Today, Google Project Zero security researcher Ian Beer &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html"&gt;has revealed that&lt;/a&gt;, until May, a variety of Apple iPhones and other iOS devices were vulnerable to an incredible exploit that could let attackers remotely reboot and take complete control of their devices from a distance — including reading emails and other messages, downloading photos, and even potentially watching and listening to you through the iPhone’s microphone and camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tcrlB"&gt;How is such a thing even possible? Why would an iPhone even listen to a remote hacking attempt? According to Beer, that’s because today’s iPhones, iPads, Macs and Watches use a protocol called Apple Wireless Direct Link (AWDL) to create mesh networks for features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20859550/apple-iphone-11-pro-airdrop-u1-locator-chip-tag-tile-bluetooth-tracking"&gt;AirDrop&lt;/a&gt; (so you can easily beam photos and files to other iOS devices) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/7/20903787/apple-macos-catalina-sidecar-macbook-air-pro-butterfly-keys-ipad"&gt;Sidecar&lt;/a&gt; (to quickly turn an iPad into a secondary screen). Not only did Beer figure out a way to exploit that, he also found a way to force AWDL to turn on even if it was left off previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J56RN1"&gt;While Beer says he has “no evidence that these issues were exploited in the wild” and admits it took him six whole months to sniff out, verify and demonstrate this exploit — and while it’s been patched as of May — he suggests we shouldn’t take the existence of such a hack lightly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9IMBmw"&gt;The takeaway from this project should not be: &lt;em&gt;no one will spend six months of their life just to hack my phone, I’m fine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D4nG6"&gt;Instead, it should be: &lt;em&gt;one person, working alone in their bedroom, was able to build a capability which would allow them to seriously compromise iPhone users they’d come into close contact with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j7KeEx"&gt;Eerie stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5DqkL"&gt;Apple doesn’t dispute the exploit existed, and in fact cites Beer in the changelogs &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211176"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211169"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; of its May 2020 security updates that are &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-3843"&gt;linked to the vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. But the company does point out that most iOS users, by far, are already using newer versions of iOS that have been patched — and suggests that an attacker would have needed to be within Wi-Fi range for it to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cxq66"&gt;You can read Beer’s lengthy explanation of exactly how the hack worked &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/12/an-ios-zero-click-radio-proximity.html"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdWmet"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 9:44 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Apple comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s $129 MagSafe Duo charger is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8gOekXVwmk68-6OmS9a1vwVrX3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68211046/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JLbfsI"&gt;Apple’s MagSafe Duo charger is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXF3%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F1%2F21883526%2Fapple-magsafe-duo-charger-available-now#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;now on sale online&lt;/a&gt;, after initially having been announced without a release date as part of this year’s iPhone launch. The $129 folding accessory includes a magnetic wireless charging puck for the iPhone 12 as well as an Apple Watch charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arR9vN"&gt;It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557152/apples-magsafe-duo-charger-wireless-iphone-12"&gt;pretty expensive for what you get&lt;/a&gt;, especially when you consider that it doesn’t include a charging brick. You’ll need to use at least a 20W USB-C adapter, like Apple’s own $19 option, in order to get the faster charging speeds — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572852/apple-magsafe-duo-charging-speed-power-confirmed"&gt;even then it won’t be as fast&lt;/a&gt; as the regular 15W MagSafe charger. 20W adapters will charge at 11W, while you’ll get up to 14W from 27W adapters and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pjpBB"&gt;That said, I can see the appeal as someone who would rather not carry two separate power bricks and cables to charge my watch and phone when traveling. Is that worth $129-plus to you? If so, right now Apple says the MagSafe Duo will ship within one business day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is selling an ugly MS Paint sweater and part of the proceeds benefit Girls Who Code</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iXBf_tiejg4ACw5v-RxX4f6-SFU=/0x0:711x474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68174378/Screen_Shot_2020_12_01_at_11.02.18_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IL7mnS"&gt;Microsoft is getting into the holiday spirit a bit early today by offering an MS Paint-themed “ugly” sweater &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/windows?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_buy_HolidaySweater"&gt;for sale on its online store&lt;/a&gt;, with a portion of the proceeds from each sale donated to Girls Who Code. The company made Windows XP and 95 sweaters in the past to give to influencers and super fans, but this marks the first time the company is selling a sweater directly to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hTxcZ"&gt;There were briefly three varieties of Microsoft “soft-wear” available for purchase this morning: the previously mentioned MS Paint sweater and leftover stock of the Windows 95 and XP sweaters. When we first checked the store, those XP and 95 sweaters were already running low on stock, and as of right now, only this year’s MS Paint sweater is available. You can check out all three varieties in the gallery below to see what you might have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y94bdJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:9813113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsJ8oS"&gt;Microsoft has had fun in the past with these promotions, even packaging the older Windows XP sweater inside a Windows XP-style box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hgpeS7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft’s ugly Christmas sweater is Windows XP this year. It even comes in a softwear box   &lt;a href="https://t.co/Oz0lNhryPI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Oz0lNhryPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1204782275755495428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZzdaa"&gt;Since MS Paint comes installed on Windows rather than being sold separately, it’s hard to know how exactly this year’s sweater will come packaged, but here’s hoping Microsoft’s goofy trend continues. Clearly the company has some sweater fans among its ranks; maybe it’s a latent bit of Bill Gates’ influence?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bill Gates" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I-n6t41Jbdu6ggaW38MfK5rW4qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/921440/billgatestock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Gates wearing a sweater, as he often does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0UlS8l"&gt;Whatever the source, the MS Paint sweater is still in stock for $69.99 a piece, with $20 of each sale going directly to Girls Who Code from today, December 1st, through the 23rd. Microsoft says it plans to donate a minimum $50,000 to the nonprofit from this promotion. If you’re unfamiliar, Girls Who Code is a nonprofit dedicated to getting more women into the computer science field by offering classes and educational resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAEZY2"&gt;The relative ugliness of these sweaters is up for debate (personally I think the MS Paint sweater looks pretty good), but if you’re nostalgic for the Windows of old, you can now deck yourself out in time for a digital ugly sweater party. Keeping on theme, Microsoft is also providing &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/ms-paint-accessories"&gt;Windows and MS Paint backgrounds&lt;/a&gt; for Skype and Teams, if you want to look like you’re trapped in a drawing you made on your parent’s computer while video chatting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sn9pVk"&gt;You can purchase the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fgear.xbox.com%2Fproducts%2Fms-paint-ugly-sweater%3Fvariant%3D37154383233189" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MS Paint Ugly Sweater now&lt;/a&gt; and benefit a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2xfWh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7PikT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HpDO1B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1ITX0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6pTV4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5Hbop"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian’s Clone Wars tie-in is the boost Disney Plus needed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91hNHYYlk21VAhLszcEGgZJrYnk=/695x0:2998x1535/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68165048/clone_wars_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bv4knR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21727128/mandalorian-crew-member-digitally-removed-erased-jeans-guy"&gt;second season&lt;/a&gt; is halfway done and, beyond The Child’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/27/21722336/the-mandalorian-s2e5-baby-yoda-name-jedi-grogu-origin"&gt;big name reveal&lt;/a&gt;, what’s become more apparent as the show goes on is how much it relies on &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAfQIg"&gt;Audiences turning to &lt;em&gt;The Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;as a way to better understand what’s happening in &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;or refresh their memories makes sense, but the spike in &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;viewership has an even bigger winner — Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEFCap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers below for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 2, episode 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="23Fqi2"&gt;Like anything in the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is rooted in deeper &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; lore. It was this week’s episode, however, and the &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/11/27/21611633/the-mandalorian-rosario-dawson-character-ahsoka-episode-5-star-wars"&gt;appearance of Ahsoka Tano&lt;/a&gt; that finally convinced me to start &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;. And based on data provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;by Parrot Analytics, I’m not the only person who’s looking to marathon Dave Filoni’s animated series to keep up with &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abgdlg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandolorian&lt;/em&gt; has caused jumps in &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; views before. When &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;first came out in November 2019, &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;saw its first massive spike. Interest remained high until the second spike in spring 2020 when the seventh season of &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;was released on Disney Plus. It dropped after that, but the show saw a third third spike accompanying &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s second season premiere in October. It’s been trending high ever since, according to the analytics firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dEQwRv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spike in ‘Clone Wars’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;viewership has an even bigger winner — Disney Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="elgySR"&gt;When looking at data from January 1st, 2017 to present day, the team’s researchers found that by the end of 2019, &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; saw a “level of demand from US audiences that is many factors greater than anything it has experienced before,” according to Samuel Stadler, vice president of marketing at Parrot Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEBiPY"&gt;To put that into additional context, &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt; now — a year after &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; debuted — is over four times as popular as it was before the live-action series came around, according to Parrot (which measures demand by how much time people are spending watching a show through social media, fan ratings, and piracy to calculate overall interest). And while data for &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Rebels &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t provided, Google Trends shows a similar spike in interest for the &lt;a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;amp;q=star%20wars%20rebels"&gt;show over the last week&lt;/a&gt;, which likely has to do with the big Admiral Thrawn reveal at the end of “The Jedi.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adFFbW"&gt;This makes sense. People sign up for or sign into Disney Plus to watch the wonderful adventures of Grogu (forever Baby Yoda in my mind), and then spend the next several weeks making their way through &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;. For Disney, it’s the best possible outcome. An October report from research firm MoffettNathanson found that daily usage on Disney Plus has declined over the last six months. There have been some spikes in viewership; &lt;em&gt;Hamilton &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;brought in a number of subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and convinced people who wouldn’t sign up for Disney Plus to do just that, but getting people to use the platform every single day was getting tougher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LSEnqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newfound and renewed interest is also a major win for Disney&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BhAlZ7"&gt;Without being able to flood the streamer with TV shows and film as often as competitors like Netflix, Disney Plus has to rely on opportunities to grow. The uptick in &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;viewership and interest helps to solve part of that problem. &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;pushes more people every single week to check out &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars &lt;/em&gt;— a show with seven seasons — which in turn might encourage fans to revisit one or two of the main Skywalker saga movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zR8AjB"&gt;The interconnected universe is something that &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fans deep into the universe’s lore want more of, and it provides Disney with the perfect opportunity to keep people on the platform when they’re done with an episode of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. With a number of live-action and animated series ordered for Disney Plus, that universe becomes a bigger web that Disney can keep spinning as fans, old and new, remain invested in the bigger &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KI5non"&gt;It’s also how Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige plans to interweave the Marvel Cinematic Universe films with the new shows on Disney Plus. &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20956718/disney-plus-marvel-movies-series-wandavision-loki-doctor-strange-star-wars-avatar"&gt;will play into&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/rumor-black-widow-florence-pugh-hawkeye-disney-plus/"&gt;there are other reports&lt;/a&gt; that characters from other films like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;could end up in the &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gfhAoh"&gt;Clearly, &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars and Rebels &lt;/em&gt;creator Dave Filoni (an executive producer on &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;) is writing &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;into his more expansive &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; universe. It’s a good thing for fans of the live-action series — the show has never been better and, as a new fan of &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;, I love catching up with a show I’ve put off for so long. But the newfound and renewed interest is also a major win for Disney in its effort to find a way to steal people’s attention away from other streamers like Netflix and, more importantly, keep it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzVJbU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsQkjQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfwkSx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The people saving our lives should get vaccinated first, experts say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CDC headquarters by James Gathany" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NyZNjBBV0t3EZ077EGb5gcxQoM=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68164331/CDC-headquarters.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbj2Jg"&gt;An independent committee at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officially recommended Tuesday that the limited first batch of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States go to health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuvp4u"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;We expect a constrained supply environment for some months and need to make the best use of available vaccine,” said Sara Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer at the CDC, during Tuesday’s meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDFtw7"&gt;Officials in the Trump administration have pushed for an early wave of vaccinations to go to older adults over the age of 65, who are at high risk of having a severe case of and dying from COVID-19, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/30/divisions-emerge-among-u-s-officials-over-when-first-covid-19-vaccine-doses-will-be-available-and-for-whom/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But the committee, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), stuck to the expected plan of placing health care workers and residents in long-term care facilities first in line. The recommendations will now go to CDC Director Robert Redfield for final approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COGha6"&gt;Beth Bell, the chair of the committee’s COVID-19 vaccine work group, stressed the urgency of the efforts to distribute vaccines. “We’re averaging one COVID-19 death per minute in the United States right now,” she said during the meeting Tuesday. “In the time it takes us to have this ACIP meeting, 180 people will have died from COVID-19.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0Ksda"&gt;Health care workers are at high risk of exposure to the coronavirus through their interactions with patients, and hundreds of thousands have contracted the disease. Protecting this group also helps prevent staffing issues at hospitals and health care facilities — surges in COVID-19 cases, and illness among health care workers, has led to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/19/covid19-hospitals-in-half-the-states-facing-massive-staffing-shortage/"&gt;shortages&lt;/a&gt; of doctors, nurses, and other health care workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGftla"&gt;Long-term care facilities have been devastated by outbreaks of COVID-19. Even though residents of these facilities make up less than 1 percent of the US population, they’ve accounted for &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-02-Dooling.pdf"&gt;40 percent&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25Ebhr"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t yet authorized any of the leading COVID-19 vaccine candidates, and it’s set to review submissions from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726554/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-pfizer-biontech"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt; this month. But states have to let the federal government know by Friday where to send shipments of the shots once the FDA signs off — and having guidelines as to which groups will get them first will guide those decisions. States don’t have to follow the recommendations, but most likely will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDLH8R"&gt;ACIP usually works to recommend how and when routine vaccinations should be given to children and adults. But when quantities of vaccines are limited, like the COVID-19 vaccine will be in the next few months, it’s also responsible for determining where the limited supply goes. ACIP laid out four ethical principles it used to determine COVID-19 vaccine priority in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6947e3.htm"&gt;report published last week&lt;/a&gt;: maximizing benefits and minimizing harms; promoting justice; mitigating health inequities; and promoting transparency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZDDuh"&gt;Moderna and Pfizer said that they’d likely&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;have enough vaccines available to vaccinate 10 million and 12.5 million people in the US, respectively, by the end of 2020. That’s more than enough to vaccinate the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-02-Dooling.pdf"&gt;approximately&lt;/a&gt; 3 million residents of long-term care facilities in the US. But there are about 21 million health care workers in the US.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If states or individual health care facilities don’t have enough vaccines to cover all health care workers in the first round of vaccinations, Oliver said there may need to be additional subgroups — workers with direct patient contact may take priority over people who could work remotely, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-03-Oliver.pdf"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YiqOEf"&gt;Capacity is expected to ramp up through the start of 2021, and vaccines will become available to broader swaths of the population. At later meetings, ACIP will vote on the groups that should get COVID-19 vaccines after health care workers and long-term care residents — next in line is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-11/COVID-04-Dooling.pdf"&gt;expected&lt;/a&gt; to be essential workers, people over 65, and adults with underlying health conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1lxFY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s Galactus event was a giant arcade shooter — and now the game is down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/831lvmmxJYvB4txeF-bL6qec2NE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68142981/Fortnite_20201201161237.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Kt3S9"&gt;The Marvel-themed season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; ended with a Galactus-sized bang. As has been teased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;since the debut of season 4 in August&lt;/a&gt;, the game’s current season concluded with a live event that pitted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; players against the planet-sized supervillain in a dramatic showdown — and it ended with the game going down, replaced by a timer for the launch of season 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPCDea"&gt;For those who managed to get into the event, things started out pretty tame. I spent around half an hour just hanging around on the Avengers’ helicarrier while empty-handed, not able to do anything like build or pick up a weapon. Epic even &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1333873453376663558"&gt;posted a message&lt;/a&gt; letting players know they were indeed in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0n6tei"&gt;When the event started properly, Galactus slowly made his way to the island before bellowing the ominous words “Beware. I hunger.” He then slapped the helicarrier out of the sky, and players were guided into the action by Iron Man himself. It was a strange event: in order to stop Galactus from destroying the island, players had to pilot a version of the iconic battle bus armed with explosives to feed the supervillain. Things played out like an over-the-top arcade shooter and eventually ended with Galactus exploding, leaving the island seemingly intact.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1HOeAxxpCxedK7R06gkXI9tJ0SI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22134842/Fortnite_20201201161314.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OJQoRo"&gt;There was also a tease connecting the events to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s own strange lore: things ended with a shot of main character Jonesy, in a suit, lying on the floor of a drab office. Currently, the game is down, with a countdown ticking away the hours until season 5 launches at 12AM ET tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiHdQQ"&gt;Leading up to the event, Galactus’ face could be seen looking in the background during battle royale matches, steadily growing in size with each day that passed. It also appears that developer Epic expected a big crowd, warning players to arrive an hour ahead of the 4PM ET kickoff time (though it ended up starting a bit later than that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmtWyG"&gt;Of course, this is just the latest in a series of dramatic live events in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. In the past, that has included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701930/fortnite-epic-games-live-event-mecha-monster-battle-showdown-giant-robot"&gt;a mech versus kaiju battle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;an explosion that flooded the island&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;a Travis Scott concert series&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the most ambitious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;saw the entire island sucked into a black hole&lt;/a&gt;, shutting the game down for several days, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;before the launch of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;: Chapter 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oDaS74"&gt;Cloud computing giant Salesforce is acquiring workplace chat app Slack, the two companies &lt;a href="https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Salesforce-Signs-Definitive-Agreement-to-Acquire-Slack/default.aspx"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The deal, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-has-held-talks-to-buy-slack-technologies-11606326392"&gt;rumblings of which began surfacing last week&lt;/a&gt;, marks one of the most consequential acquisitions in the business software industries in recent years and Salesforce’s biggest purchase ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="190ebj"&gt;Salesforce is paying $27.7 billion for Slack, according to the press release. “Under the terms of the agreement, Slack shareholders will receive $26.79 in cash and 0.0776 shares of Salesforce common stock for each Slack share, representing an enterprise value of approximately $27.7 billion based on the closing price of Salesforce’s common stock on November 30, 2020,” the announcement reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWNzEX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms in enterprise software history.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnI40g"&gt;“Stewart and his team have built one of the most beloved platforms in enterprise software history, with an incredible ecosystem around it,” said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. “This is a match made in heaven. Together, Salesforce and Slack will shape the future of enterprise software and transform the way everyone works in the all-digital, work-from-anywhere world. I’m thrilled to welcome Slack to the Salesforce Ohana once the transaction closes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqjwca"&gt;“Salesforce started the cloud revolution, and two decades later, we are still tapping into all the possibilities it offers to transform the way we work. The opportunity we see together is massive,” said Slack CEO Stewart Butterfield. “As software plays a more and more critical role in the performance of every organization, we share a vision of reduced complexity, increased power and flexibility, and ultimately a greater degree of alignment and organizational agility. Personally, I believe this is the most strategic combination in the history of software, and I can’t wait to get going.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqk9BU"&gt;Slack has transformed from a fast-rising startup formed as a gaming company in 2009 into a major competitor of Microsoft with more than 12 million daily active users as of October of last year (and likely many more now, though the company has not disclosed concrete numbers) and a market value of close to $25 billion. The company, led by Flickr co-creator Butterfield, started primarily as an email alternative that pitched itself to startups, media companies, and other tech-savvy businesses to better manage interoffice communication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V5fmn"&gt;But Butterfield and his team grew Slack into a full productivity suite with video meeting features, file hosting, IT administration, and all manner of other features typically offered by large enterprise corporations. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21132060/ibm-slack-chat-employee-rollout-microsoft-teams-competition"&gt;expanded its partnership with IBM&lt;/a&gt; to include the company’s entire 350,000-plus workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcT8JD"&gt;However, Slack has also struggled in the face of fierce competition from not just Microsoft, but Facebook and other companies that have launched their own versions of office chat and productivity platforms. The company had lost nearly half of its market value since going public in April 2019, and it failed to turn a profit during its last three quarters despite the surge in remote work due to COVID-19. The company did not have an obvious path to becoming profitable and no clear way to overcome increasing pressure from Microsoft Teams, making a potential acquisition more likely with each passing quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRdk3j"&gt;Salesforce, also a major competitor to Microsoft but in the cloud sector, is worth nearly $220 billion and has grown to become one of the largest software companies on the planet, thanks to its customer relationship management software that helps businesses manage sales online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zI371u"&gt;Both Salesforce and Slack have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195092/slack-new-user-records-coronavirus-pandemic-remote-working-growth-concurrent-users"&gt;only become more vital during the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt; as companies worldwide have moved to remote work and moved substantial portions of their businesses online. Yet, unlike Slack, which has seen a rollercoaster of climbs and steep drops in its stock price, Salesforce has only seen its market valuation expand in recent months. Its shares peaked at an all-time high in September. Salesforce and Slack joining together ensures both platforms can better compete against Microsoft, Oracle, and other cloud and enterprise companies in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
