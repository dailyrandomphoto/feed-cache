    <title>NFT mania is here, and so are the scammers</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Artists are seeing their work showing up in NFTs they did not mint themselves&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="su3n7K"&gt;The artist Derek Laufman woke up last weekend to a couple emails from his followers, who had a question for him. They wanted to know if he’d started selling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; — non-fungible tokens — of his art. But it wasn’t just email. People had DMed him on Instagram and Twitter, too. “I just replied, that’s 100 percent not me,” Laufman says when I reach him by video call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgWHGZ"&gt;On Rarible, a site where people can purchase NFTs, a verified profile had appeared that alleged to be from him — which means that someone took the time to impersonate him all the way through the &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/How-to-get-verified-on-Rarible-c6496e55ff33440bbe75ef19701a47fa"&gt;platform’s verification process&lt;/a&gt;. “I was basically kind of annoyed that somebody had, quote, unquote, verified me as on that platform,” Laufman says. “I dealt with having my art stolen for years. And I’m sort of numb to that. But when somebody is claiming to be you ... that kind of, you know, pisses me off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmUoyx"&gt;After a few people reported the theft and impersonation and Laufman fired off a few messages on Twitter about the situation, Rarible took the profile down. But not before one of his fans had bought an NFT of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ozHYeD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is 100% NOT me. I thought the point of NFT was that the artwork and artists needed to be verified? Apparently super easy to scam people. What a joke that platform is. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FrBy4zuhQy"&gt;https://t.co/FrBy4zuhQy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Derek Laufman (@laufman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/laufman/status/1370715624058544128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t4RWUE"&gt;While you’ve probably heard of NFTs by now, you’ve probably heard more about digital art selling for exorbitant sums than about the creators who are getting ripped off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0FtCq"&gt;Which is a shame. The promise of NFTs is pretty easy to grasp: if you’re a digital creator, they represent a way to make money off of work that might not otherwise be salable. You can earn royalties from future sales of work in perpetuity — and it can be built right into the object itself. But the reality of NFTs is different, and grimmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6mhVkb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KXIpDW"&gt;Artists like Laufman have have had their work minted as NFTs and listed for sale without their permission; and as in that case, platforms that host stolen art only seem to moderate if the artist finds out and posts about it on social media. &lt;em&gt;Tales From The Loop &lt;/em&gt;author Simon Stålenhag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simonstalenhag/status/1369661661146193925"&gt;found his art&lt;/a&gt; on Marble Cards, another NFT site, and Giphy has warned that people are turning user-created GIFs from its site into NFTs. Because the NFT system doesn’t require people to actually own the copyright to something to mint it, it’s a market ripe for fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flAd5w"&gt;NFTs are unique digital widgets that are typically part of the Ethereum blockchain and can be used to identify the owner of a piece of digital art. Any digital object can become an NFT, as long as it’s been “minted,” or put on the blockchain as a token. They’re sort of like trading cards, if the card was digital and pointed to the URL of a JPEG. And because these tokens are represented on a blockchain — which is predicated on burning cheap electricity to solve mathematical puzzles, which when solved pay out some amount of cryptocurrency — there is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;as yet unspecified negative environmental cost associated with transacting them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96rHLy"&gt;The whole system is predicated on the understanding that the people minting NFTs are who they say they are. &lt;a href="https://news.artnet.com/market/nyan-cat-nft-sells-for-560000-1945679"&gt;Would you buy a GIF of Nyan Cat for $560,000&lt;/a&gt;, for example, if the creator of the meme wasn’t the person who was selling it as an NFT online? Because anything can be tokenized on the blockchain — where, by the way, the record is immutable — anything can end up as a NFT, even if the creator of an artwork isn’t the person selling it online for Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EpxbcT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;non fungible tokens (NFTs) have no inherent value and not even technologically innovative — they require the pre-existing system of violence and control to enforce a belief in the value of what is ultimately a glorified checksum&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea E. Manning (@xychelsea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xychelsea/status/1371848551651741708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Df7aD"&gt;While it’s unclear whether the problem is widespread, many artists have started checking sites like OpenSea and Rarible to see if their work has been minted without their permission. “I’d seen a few posts going around of people who’d had their art stolen,” says Devin Elle Kurtz, an artist and visual developer, when I reach her by phone. So Kurtz decided to look around to see if her own work had been taken. “And I was like, you know, it probably hasn’t. You know... it’s probably fine.” As the narrator of this story, I can say: it wasn’t fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVTJoP"&gt;“I searched my name and sure enough it came up,” Kurtz says. “One of the first results was my art on this Marble Cards website.” The piece in question was around five years old, from her DeviantArt account, and it had made it to the front page of the website. “The person who turned it into an NFT had, like, put their handle all over it,” Kurtz added. “Like, all over the frame, they’d like put their watermark on it with their Twitter handle.” Which is very weird! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bZLC1y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I searched my name to make sure my art hadn't been stolen and turned into NFTs, and sure thing, an obscure old piece from my DeviantArt is randomly on the front page of the marble cards NFT website? How is this allowed... &lt;a href="https://t.co/EE1jXLuQDL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EE1jXLuQDL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Devin - Artbook Kickstarter Soon! (@DevinElleKurtz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DevinElleKurtz/status/1370250777768251392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJ4j3d"&gt;“I don’t know who that person is, and they may not have known they were doing anything wrong,” Kurtz says. “Nothing against that individual if they didn’t realize that what they were doing might not be the greatest.” It was priced at 1.03 Ether, which as of publication time works out to $1,844.03; &lt;a href="https://www.marble-cards.info/cards/69743"&gt;it’s still up&lt;/a&gt;, though Marble Cards removed the image at Kurtz’s request. But the NFT — the frame around the URL in the case of Marble Cards — will continue to exist forever, on the blockchain. (Marble Cards is unique in that it lets users mint and trade “frames” around artwork, rather than the artwork itself, theoretically avoiding copyright issues — though artists clearly disagree.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCiCYL"&gt;Kurtz’s experience is emblematic of the big problem with NFTs, generally speaking: anyone can mint anything. All you need is an Ethereum wallet and some cash for “gas fees” — in other words, the cost of doing the transaction to put whatever you’re minting on the Ethereum blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGAgyz"&gt;On OpenSea and Rarible, two major NFT platforms, you don’t have to verify you own something before putting it on the blockchain. Verifying yourself on these platforms is also not difficult; Rarible’s process involves submitting social handles for verification but doesn’t seem to check whether you own those handles, as in Laufman’s case. OpenSea, on the other hand, has foregone verification entirely. Its recommendation for buyers is now, “Do your own research.” (Neither platform had responded to requests for comment at press time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5kMQkD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;From now on, creators no longer need to submit their collections for approval. All NFTs will appear in the public search.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those of you currently waiting, the gray warning icons on your items are gone, and your collection will appear in the public search within a week.&lt;/p&gt;— OpenSea (@opensea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1370895902982946820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHm5vZ"&gt;I spoke to the independent crypto journalist Amy Castor to get her opinion on this kind of NFT fraud. Castor recently wrote a &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2021/03/14/metakovan-the-mystery-beeple-art-buyer-and-his-nft-defi-scheme/"&gt;story for her personal website&lt;/a&gt; about the biggest sale in NFT history — of the artist Beeple’s work, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;which the famed auction house Christie’s sold for $69 million&lt;/a&gt; — alleging that Metakovan, the pseudonymous buyer, bought the work to finance a pump-and-dump scheme with another token they own, &lt;a href="https://b20.metapurse.fund/"&gt;B.20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7LcsZi"&gt;“Anybody can create an entity about anything and just sell it on a marketplace. There probably aren’t that many protections in place. But, I mean, the key thing is you’re not buying anything,” Castor says when I reach her by phone. “If you buy identity as a token, it’s just this coin. There’s really no intrinsic value to it, other than what somebody else is going to pay you for it,” she continues. “It’s all speculative at the end of the day.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rivian planning to install 10,000 EV chargers across the US and Canada by 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1VjnlZGEZ8e_6p3BQCseHVXjIU=/0x170:2040x1530/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998445/A._Rivian_R1S_Front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photos: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Amazon-backed electric vehicle startup Rivian will install more than 10,000 fast chargers across the US and Canada by 2023, the company announced. The Rivian Adventure Network is designed to allow quick recharges along highways and also includes Level 2 charges at more remote locations near parks and other destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzKSgN"&gt;Rivian described the network &lt;a href="https://stories.rivian.com/charging-your-rivian"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oBOUub"&gt;Each site will have multiple chargers and will be conveniently located on highways and main roads, often by cafes and shops. These DC fast chargers will be for Rivian owners only, with details on pricing and associated programs coming soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OWQ1Ct"&gt;The company also is installing waypoint Level 2 AC chargers, each with a 11.5 kW charging speed, to add about 25 miles of range every hour for Rivian’s R1T pickup and R1S SUV. These chargers will be located along routes that Rivian thinks its drivers will take. The first such waypoint chargers are being installed in Colorado’s state parks beginning in July, and will be accessible to any electric vehicle with a J1772 plug. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aj1sahKGEMe7BivjZ8vVVwWAChc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22384777/rivian_map.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Rivian&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A map of the 3,500 fast chargers Rivian is planning at 600 sites&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Nt1xa3"&gt;Rivian says drivers can locate the waypoints and fast chargers in their vehicles’ navigation systems and the Rivian app. The network will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLBb1S"&gt;It’s an ambitious plan to be sure, and Rivian is still a relatively new player in the EV market, with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18111782/rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-price-specs-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/27/18113257/rivian-r1s-suv-electric-la-auto-show-2018"&gt;SUV&lt;/a&gt; debuting late in 2018 (it began operating in stealth mode in 2009). But the company has managed to raise several huge funding rounds, with Amazon leading a $700 million round in February 2019, and Ford adding $500 million in April 2019. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238670/rivian-funding-amazon-electric-truck-suv"&gt;Rivian raised $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt; from T. Rowe Price and Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer reportedly hit with $50 million ransomware demand </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-IT-ACER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ipSG9nM9cet4o9thn3AO2PSexJA=/0x0:4980x3320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998335/168291403.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiOt3u"&gt;A hacking group is demanding $50 million from Acer, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-giant-acer-hit-by-50-million-ransomware-attack/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported, in what appears to be one of the biggest ransomware demands to date. According to &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;, the attackers may have gained access to the Taiwanese computer manufacturer’s network via a Microsoft Exchange vulnerability. The REvil group that carried out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054951/travelex-currency-exchange-offline-malware-attack-ransom"&gt;ransomware attack on Travelex&lt;/a&gt; last year is believed to be behind the Acer breach as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzuA7d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;said REvil is giving Acer until March 28th to pay the ransom or it will leak the data it claims to have collected. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/03/02/multiple-security-updates-released-for-exchange-server/"&gt;recently released&lt;/a&gt; several security updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316189/microsoft-exchange-server-security-exploit-china-attack-30000-organizations"&gt;fix vulnerabilities for exploits found in its Exchange&lt;/a&gt; software, but it wasn’t immediately clear whether the Acer breach was connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdb_0515abfc-0be0-4521-a38c-1cc9d88b3ace"&gt;Acer did not immediately reply to a request for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, but told &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; in a statement that “Companies like us are constantly under attack, and we have reported recent abnormal situations observed to the relevant law enforcement and data protection authorities in multiple countries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n80hLD"&gt;Acer did not acknowledge in its statement whether it had been the victim of a ransomware attack, but added there was an “ongoing investigation” that prevented the company from commenting further due to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft may have fixed what wasn’t broke with Windows 10 BSOD printer patch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rIZgDM"&gt;If you’re the kind of person who’d be amused to learn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft"&gt;that a humble printer can blue screen your entire Windows 10 PC,&lt;/a&gt; here’s a dose of schadenfreude to welcome you into the weekend: when Microsoft tried to &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; those blue screen issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332916/windows-10-update-fixes-printer-blue-screen-of-death-issue-crash-microsoft"&gt;with a Monday patch&lt;/a&gt;, the patch may have not gone quite as planned — some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m5wmsu/outofband_updates_are_now_available_to_fix_the/"&gt;started reporting&lt;/a&gt; their printers would simply spit out blank pages or ones with missing graphics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1KDQS"&gt;Now, the company’s &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center#1574"&gt;released a second patch&lt;/a&gt; to address those issues too (via &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-printer-glitches-microsoft-issues-second-out-of-band-patch/?ftag=COS-05-10aaa0g&amp;amp;taid=6055064aac741e000115f41d&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jWagLT"&gt;Microsoft identified an issue that affects Windows 10 devices which applied the March 2021 security update released March 9, 2021 and the out-of-band updates released March 15, 2021, and a resolution has been expedited. Affected devices might receive unexpected results when printing from some apps or to some printers. Issues might include missing or solid color graphics, misalignment/formatting issues, or printing of blank pages/labels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aGFgGr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/m8b0ai/windows_10_printing_fixed_for_real_this_time/"&gt;Some users say&lt;/a&gt; that it works, and may even fix some additional blue-screening computers. A few say they’re still having issues. If you’re affected, good luck to you!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SkZunV"&gt;It’s hard to believe it’s only been seven months since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368504/fortnite-apple-google-app-store-brief-incomplete-timeline"&gt;Apple booted &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;off the App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;Epic Games sprung its antitrust trap&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t have to wait much longer before the behind-the-scenes legal machinations give way to courtroom drama — and, it seems, until Apple and Epic’s top executives take the stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HH4vgl"&gt;In a legal filing Friday evening, Apple revealed that CEO Tim Cook, SVP Craig Federighi, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354367/apple-phil-schiller-fellow-greg-joswiak-head-marketing-store-events"&gt;former marketing chief and current App Store boss Phil Schiller&lt;/a&gt; intend to testify live and in person in the courtroom, among many other tentative witnesses. Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney and VP Mark Rein should be there as well, plus Facebook’s VP of gaming, a Microsoft VP of Xbox business development, and quite a number of directors on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lEs5de"&gt;Schiller is expected to spend the most time on the witness stand by far at an estimated 11 hours of examination and cross-examination, which makes sense. Not only has he been in charge of the App Store that’s at the center of the case, but some of his emails and the emails of his subordinates have been under scrutiny — both for this case and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;in the big tech antitrust hearing last year&lt;/a&gt;, one which ended with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;the House Judiciary Committee concluding that&lt;/a&gt; “Apple exerts monopoly power in the mobile app store market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2avXFS"&gt;Apple says its executives “look forward to sharing with the court”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UZEeRl"&gt;Our senior executives look forward to sharing with the court the very positive impact the App Store has had on innovation, economies across the world and the customer experience over the last 12 years. We feel confident the case will prove that Epic purposefully breached its agreement solely to increase its revenues, which is what resulted in their removal from the App Store. By doing that, Epic circumvented the security features of the App Store in a way that would lead to reduced competition and put consumers’ privacy and data security at tremendous risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wNRhb7"&gt;The trial &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.116.0.pdf"&gt;should tentatively begin May 3rd&lt;/a&gt;, and is expected to run several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter confirms it’s testing an ‘undo tweet’ feature — but it could be limited to Professional Tweeters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-VZ235PLiewtEabLjd8GCMdA1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68997000/acastro_170726_1777_0012_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nQnTB3"&gt;The evidence is mounting that Twitter will be adding an “undo tweet” feature, but that those who want it will have to pay: app researcher Jane Manchun Wong has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1372815977675558915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1372815977675558915%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnet.com%2Fnews%2Ftwitter-might-let-you-undo-tweets-if-you-pay-a-subscription-fee%2F"&gt;discovered a subscription screen&lt;/a&gt; tied to the feature. The ability to take back tweets has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349644/twitter-subscription-service-survey-undo-sent-analytics-feature-ideas"&gt;shown up on a survey&lt;/a&gt; asking Twitter users about features they’d be willing to pay for, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314973/twitter-undo-send-interface-leak-paid-feature-rumor-app-researcher"&gt;as well as in the code&lt;/a&gt; for the app, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitter-might-let-you-undo-tweets-if-you-pay-a-subscription-fee/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;received confirmation today&lt;/a&gt; from Twitter that it is, in fact, being tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r8ang"&gt;When it will become widely available is unknown, but it’s understandable why Twitter could be considering reserving the feature for its &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-subscription-model-2020-7#:~:text=Twitter%20CEO%20Jack%20Dorsey%20confirmed,pay%20for%20using%20the%20service."&gt;potential subscription service&lt;/a&gt;: what’s a better lure than a “keep yourself out of trouble” button?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hgPyIu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on app subscription for paid features like “Undo Tweet” &lt;a href="https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH"&gt;https://t.co/CrqnzIPcOH&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ct16Gk2RL1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ct16Gk2RL1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1372815977675558915?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jh4O8Z"&gt;For its part, Twitter hasn't said if the feature will be limited to paying customers — it’s possible it’s not far enough along in development for that decision to have been made yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baEFJG"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the button’s design suggests that it works similarly to the “undo send” button in Gmail, where the site simply waits a few seconds before actually sending the message. In other words, it’s not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; the edit button that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/A9ZvwOsLplU?t=133"&gt;people clamor for&lt;/a&gt;, but it could at least get you some of the way to that functionality (albeit minus the part where someone else can tell you that you’ve made a mistake). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMdm1T"&gt;If Twitter is open to suggestions for the undo button, here’s one: have it pop up if someone blasts through the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;offensive tweet warning&lt;/a&gt;, giving them a few more seconds to reconsider. Whether that would fix the general atmosphere on Twitter is hard to say, but it’s probably at least worth a shot, right?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What day is it? Twitter’s got you covered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a8Q8-NHHvxZlMwrZinhlSl63BWM=/181x0:2101x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996592/Ev9xPBwXYAw8fmn.0.jpeg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldI9hF"&gt;What day is it? Wednesday? Can someone please tell me? I don’t have a paper calendar, so there’s no way to know. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1372924437436063745"&gt;And I can’t trust Dieter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaAwM1"&gt;What’s that? There are Twitter accounts and bots that can tell me the days of the week? Perfect, I never stop scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SorhvU"&gt;INT. STUDIO APARTMENT — AFTERNOON&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnjTwo"&gt;A man stands at his desk in front of the cold light of a computer monitor. We HEAR anxious TYPING as the man MASHES the keys on his keyboard. His eyes DART back and forth as he searches for treasures hidden in the depths of the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0t0qzs"&gt;Hours pass, and then...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OfbAUl"&gt;Huzzah! I found accounts that will tell me the days of the week! Well, mostly. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zd9aJh"&gt;Monday &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 id="g0Wesw"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUzF0E"&gt;When I first posted this story, I couldn’t find an account that’s dedicated to posting when it is Tuesday. But literally one minute after I hit publish, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aejb_/status/1373050568504131588"&gt;a reader sent me&lt;/a&gt; a Tuesday-focused account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/no_problemm_?s=21"&gt;@No_Problemm_&lt;/a&gt;, which posts the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/tuesday-again-no-problem"&gt;Tuesday Again?

Every Tuesday, the account posts a clip &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/qvc4DMiioRc"&gt;from the Garfield movie &lt;em&gt;A Tale of Two Kitties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which stars Bill Murray as everyone’s favorite Monday-hating cat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;So what probably happened here is that Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. (And if you look at the image from the second ad, you can see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo studied the blade so poorly it forgot to include one in its Demon Slayer-themed gaming chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Demon Slayer Lenovo gaming chair" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeZIFSBtfvI1ZFzF2jE8xMuGKDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996215/demonslayerchair.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pOWcIe"&gt;Lenovo isn’t a major player in the gaming chair scene, but its &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer&lt;/em&gt;-themed creation shows that it could easily dice up the competition if it chose to. Per &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-themed-gaming-chair-has-a-katana-holder-1846510944"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has made a limited edition chair that has a holstered katana built onto its side. But before you imagine spinning around in the chair with a sword out, there’s sadly no katana in the holster. Is it false advertising to make a &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer&lt;/em&gt; chair with which you can’t actually slay demons? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfRU90"&gt;Doubly sad is that you can’t buy the chair. Only five are being made &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fjp%2Fja%2Flandings%2Fkimetsu_sns2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F19%2F22340795%2Flenovo-demon-slayer-anime-gaming-chair-katana-japan-promotion" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for a giveaway promo in Japan&lt;/a&gt;. Hey, if you live in Japan, follow Lenovo of Japan’s Twitter account, then retweet a tweet, and try to win this chair on behalf of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Demon Slayer gaming chair" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SpWFVDfv-pc7WuLhwF7RXoD_ZmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383717/block2_item2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the necessary parts are here, except for the katana itself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kOT3u6"&gt;Lenovo says this is a customized version of a preexisting model, but it still looks cool. Its colorway matches the wardrobe of Giyu Tomioka of the &lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer&lt;/em&gt; series, and perhaps this really could have been a hit here since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334004/demon-slayer-the-movie-mugen-train-north-america-release-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon Slayer&lt;/em&gt; is coming to the US&lt;/a&gt; after a big box office launch in Japan. But alas, I’m stuck here on a Friday, gawking over a chair I can’t have, thinking of ways in which this will inspire so many people to try to mount katanas to their gaming chairs. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95phCC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Breadwinner is the new smart sourdough starter tracker of my dreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kjltigUO1--9OzbLT-SOy7vO3Io=/0x0:3872x2581/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996193/lid_ad_wide_74b8adebd53680f236b433c416185eeea39526b6d172e71bb34b98d8f3ed0a0e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dkosG5"&gt;Sourdough bread is a tricky thing to get right. But &lt;a href="https://breadwinner.life/buy"&gt;Breadwinner&lt;/a&gt;, a new smart gadget in development from hardware designers (and bread lovers) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fredbenenson/"&gt;Fred Benenson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spavis"&gt;Sarah Pavis&lt;/a&gt;, is looking to try to take a little bit of the mystery out of the yeast by offering an app-connected gadget that can track the volume and temperature of your starter and notify you when it’s ready to bake, &lt;a href="https://laughingsquid.com/breadwinner-sourdough-starter-monitoring-device/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Laughing&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Squid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FAnQWL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If&lt;/em&gt; you’ve never baked with a starter before, it’s very different from store-bought yeast. Your starter (mine, in case you were curious, is named Lancelot) needs to be fed frequently and rises and falls throughout the day as the yeast feeds on the sugars in the flour and creates bubbles of carbon dioxide — the same bubbles that help make your finished loaf of sourdough so fluffy and delicious. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HKOe976BUAVj02P0A4Xv_CI8JFE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383719/growth_graph_3e24ebc638d9536d4d65672e8977c66a6f09050ee79fd42bb75b4264dff5189a.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="19OhUx"&gt;But figuring out &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; to use your starter after a feeding is a tricky balance of art and science. What Breadwinner aims to do is take the guesswork out of the equation by letting you track the growth of your starter after a feeding and letting you know precisely when the peak point is to start mixing your doughs. It also logs previous feedings, allowing you to track the performance of your starter over time and tweak variables to get that perfect loaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ryYA3"&gt;The Breadwinner unit itself is designed to fit on top of a 16oz Ball Mason jar, and it works by using an infrared sensor to measure starter height. It also can take temperature readings of the surrounding air to make sure that it’s not too hot (or too cold), and it includes Wi-Fi connectivity to connect to your smartphone. A button on the top lets you easily log when you’ve fed your starter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QCyowE"&gt;The current model — which costs $140 — is in the middle of a public prototyping phase. Buying a Breadwinner today is emphatically not buying a finished product. The hardware is extremely unfinished, and the current version charges via Micro USB, which I am fervently hoping will be swapped to USB-C for the finished product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6UC96"&gt;Obviously, that’s a lot to spend on any gadget, much less one that’s still extremely unfinished and as limited in function as this one — but if you’re someone who really likes baking bread, gadgets, and data analysis, it could be a fun addition to your kitchen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSSuGu"&gt;The Breadwinner team is also planning to use feedback from early users — and the valuable data from the different types of starters, flour mixes, and feeding schedules from more users — to further refine the product before a commercially produced version arrives in the future. That might be worth waiting for if you’d prefer a more refined (or cheaper) product. To sweeten the pot, the prototype also comes with access to a Breadwinner Discord and a $50 discount of the final model when it’s released.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ptXRvc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://breadwinner.life/"&gt;Breadwinner&lt;/a&gt; isn’t just about the single gadget, though. The site is pitched as an online community for bread enthusiasts, a self-described “social network for yeast” that aims to be a place for bakers to post recipes, share bread pictures, and get advice from fellow bakers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
