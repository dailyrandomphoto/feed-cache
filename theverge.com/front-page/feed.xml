    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We’re headed into ‘uncharted territory’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PDobDZ"&gt;Across China and Western Europe in July, the amount of rain that might typically fall over several months to a year came down within a matter of days, triggering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22607996/flood-risk-satellite-data-nature-study"&gt;floods&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/23/germany-floods-street-night/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3437bdb%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7%2F596a4fb9ae7e8a0ef33cf3d7%2F11%2F70%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7"&gt;swept entire homes&lt;/a&gt; off their foundations. In June, the usually mild regions of Southwest Canada and the US’s Pacific Northwest saw temperatures that &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/06/the-cool-lush-pacific-northwest-roasts-in-death-valley-like-temperatures/"&gt;rivaled highs in California’s Death Valley&lt;/a&gt; desert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;severe heat&lt;/a&gt; was enough to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckle roads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dangerous-heat-wave-is-literally-melting-critical-infra-1847186624"&gt;melt power cables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xyNxF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Humans are fueling more dangerous weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eeGg7A"&gt;Yesterday, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark United Nations report&lt;/a&gt; helped put those kinds of extreme events into context. By burning fossil fuels and releasing planet-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, humans are fueling more dangerous weather. Researchers have been able to connect the dots between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change for decades. But the new report showcases a big leap forward in climate science: being able to tie the climate crisis directly to extreme weather events like the June heatwave, which would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;according to recent studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1kgIe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the new report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He walks us through the phenomena that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;supercharging extreme weather events&lt;/a&gt;. And he explains why scientists have gotten so much better at seeing the “human footprint” in each weather disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et03sx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZCCv5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new United Nations report ties many changes in extreme weather to a more intense water cycle. What is the water cycle and how does it affect the weather?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slIubg"&gt;The water cycle is basically the way that we track moisture moving through the climate system. So it includes everything from the oceans to the atmosphere, the clouds, ice, rivers, lakes, the groundwater, and the way that those things move and transfer moisture and water from place to place. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="China Henan Massive Evacuation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiwQ9a5ScPy1c_CzmwsYqtEq1BE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772269/1234214409.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Feature China / Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rescuers transfer citizens out of the flooded zone in a massive evacuation effort in Weihui city in central China’s Henan province on July 26th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOESaB"&gt;So when we’re talking about the intensification of the water cycle, we’re basically saying things are moving faster. Air is pulling the moisture out of the oceans and out of the land faster. It’s moving more moisture from place to place on the planet. And when it rains, it can come down hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFUGUy"&gt;The fundamental difference is that there is more energy in the system. There’s more heat. And as the temperature goes up, there is an overall increase in the amount of moisture that the air is trying to hold. So that means when a storm happens, there’s more moisture in the air to tap into for a big, heavy downpour. It also means that when air moves over a region, it has the potential to suck more moisture out of the ground more rapidly. So the same phenomenon is leading both to more intensive rainfalls and floods and precipitation, and also to more stark drought conditions when they do occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI2mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are people affected by those changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxYTEF"&gt;So, I personally live in New York City. We are affected by the water cycle, for example, when there’s a heavy downpour it can flood subway stations. It can lead to surface flooding in rivers and streets that can affect transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nckm5j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heavy rain inundated New York City yesterday afternoon, partially submerging the 157th St Subway station in Washington Heights, footage shows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A flash flood watch was in effect for New York City through Thursday night. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VqbyR3hM2q"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VqbyR3hM2q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NPR (@NPR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1413523611504218116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwNzj9"&gt;Other parts of the world have different engagements with the water cycle. They may be concerned about the snow fall or river floods that affect broad areas. And then of course huge parts of the world are concerned about drought. When we look at something like drought, it doesn’t just affect agriculture. It also affects ecosystems and urban parks. It affects water resources and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;infrastructure like power plants&lt;/a&gt; and roads and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uYyU0"&gt;So in all of these climate factors, we see that more than one sector is affected by these changes. We also see that if you take any specific thing that we care about, like agricultural fields, they are affected by more than just one type of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSH041"&gt;A specific set of climate conditions can lead to two extremes at the same time. So for example, heat and drought often go together because as conditions become drier, all of that sunshine, all of that energy, all of that heat goes into warming the air. That is a reinforcing cycle that can make hot and dry conditions even more extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKShTi"&gt;The big picture, as we’re seeing it, is that climate change is affecting all of the regions on Earth, with multiple types of climate changes already observed. And as the climate changes further, these shifts become more pronounced and widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78V3IH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read that “weather whiplash” is becoming more common because of climate change — what is “weather whiplash”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2hyqq"&gt;This idea that you can go from extreme to extreme very rapidly is giving society this sensation of a whiplash. This is part of the idea of an intensified water cycle. The water is moving faster, so when a wet condition comes it can be extremely wet. And then behind it could be a dry condition that can quickly get extremely dry. That type of shift from wet to dry conditions is something that we explore and understand in our climate models, but the lived experience of it can be quite jarring — and not just uncomfortable, but a direct challenge for ecosystems and other things that we care about in society. They really are connected in many cases to the same types of phenomenon, and this new report connects the dots between this phenomenon and our human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRLTTl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do scientists study how climate change affects extreme weather events? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMcR6"&gt;There have been big steps forward in the methodologies and the scientific rigor of detection and attribution studies, which is another way of saying: understanding the human influence on these events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQv2y"&gt;The basic idea behind the extreme event attribution is that we need to compare the likelihood that an event would have happened without human influences against the likelihood of that event happening, given that we have influenced the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxPJkm"&gt;We are able to use observational records and our models to look at what conditions were like before there was strong human influence. We look at what we call a preindustrial condition, before the Industrial Revolution and land use changes led to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="esuhrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A really exciting, cutting-edge field”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdidUs"&gt;If we can understand how likely events would have been before we had our climate influences, and then compare it against the likelihoods today with those climate change influences factored in, that allows us to identify the increased chance of those events because of our influence. It allows us to attribute a human component of those extreme events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2FQVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have researchers gotten so much better at attributing extreme weather events to climate change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQz0fY"&gt;This is a really exciting, cutting-edge field right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rxKe9"&gt;Methodological advances and several groups that have really taken this on as a major focus of their efforts have, in many ways, increased our ability and the speed at which we can make these types of connections. So that’s a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd9vDW"&gt;Every year, the computational power is stronger in terms of what our models can do. We also use remote sensing to have a better set of observations in parts of the world where we don’t have weather stations. And we have models that are designed to integrate multiple types of observations into the same kind of physically coherent system, so that we can understand and fill in the gaps between those observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huEtaC"&gt;The other thing, of course, is when you look at any single attribution study, you get a piece of the picture. But what the new report does is bring them all into one place and assesses them together, and draw out larger messages. When you look at them all together, it is a much stronger and more compelling case than any one single event. And this is what the scientific community is showing us, that these things are part of a larger pattern of change that we have influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A farmer walks back to his car between two barren fields once sown with row crops on July 23rd, 2021 in the town of Huron, California in California’s drought-stricken Central Valley. Before the drought, the fields were sown with hemp or garlic crops, but as a result of California’s water restrictions the farm decided not to plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PVVhg9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should we expect in the future when it comes to extreme weather? And what might we need to do to adapt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83S6Nh"&gt;First of all, it’s not like drought is a new phenomenon. There are parts of the world that are dealing with these conditions every day of the year. What we’re seeing, however, is that the overall set of expected conditions is moving into uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlBOVu"&gt;I want to emphasize it’s not just the record levels that we care about. We also care about the frequency by which these extremes occur, how long they last, the seasonal timing of when things like the last frost occurs, and also the spatial extent of extreme events — so where are conditions going to happen in the future that are outside of the observed experience of the last several generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIoP5G"&gt;It is a set of challenges that we have to face in terms of how do we adapt or manage the risk of these changes. Also, how do we prepare knowing that they may come in combination or in overlapping ways, with more than one extreme event happening at the same time, or in the same season in a sequence, or potentially hitting different parts of the same market or commodities trade exchange or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zoPziC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I still remain optimistic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NvfqKz"&gt;We are facing a situation where we have more information about these regional risks, but also know that every increment of climate change that occurs makes these changes more prominent. That sounds scary, but it also gives us agency. It gives us the ability to reduce these changes if we reduce emissions, and if we can eventually limit them to something like net zero — no total carbon emissions into the climate system. And in that sense, I still remain optimistic despite all this information that you’re seeing in the report about the changes that could come. The bottom line is we have the potential to reduce those changes, if we can get emissions under control.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CyberDog is a new ominous-looking robot from Xiaomi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j1cbKwn1ypedl-5fVhVDapi-bIA=/0x52:2000x1385/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704204/CyberDog_012.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDHSVv"&gt;Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has unveiled a quadrupedal robot named CyberDog: an experimental, open-source machine that the firm says “holds unforetold possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEiU8y"&gt;CyberDog is the latest example of tech companies embracing the quadrupedal form factor in robotics. The most notable example of the trend is Spot, a machine built by US firm Boston Dynamics. Spot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;went on sale last year&lt;/a&gt; for $74,500 and has been put to a range of uses, from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GbcDK7E9rVQ"&gt;surveying dangerous mines&lt;/a&gt; to helping doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231855/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-covid-19-coronavirus-telemedicine"&gt;connect with patients remotely&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also been tested by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;both law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;and the military&lt;/a&gt;, though not as a weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkUo7e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog has a “pet-like nature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sl2YTv"&gt;It’s not clear what purpose Xiaomi envisions for CyberDog. In a press release, the company stressed the open-source nature of the machine’s design and that it would release only 1,000 units initially for “Xiaomi Fans, engineers, and robotic enthusiasts.” The company says it hopes these first users will “propel the development and potential of quadruped robots” and is pricing the robot to sell. The first 1,000 units will cost just 9,999 Yuan, or roughly $1,540 (though it’s not clear if this price will be the same for any future releases). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1Tb6J"&gt;The same press release highlights CyberDog’s “pet-like nature,” including its ability to respond to voice commands and follow its owner like a real dog. Looking at pictures of CyberDog, though, it’s clear Xiaomi isn’t pitching the machine as a rival to Aibo, Sony’s own robot canine. While Aibo is small and cute, CyberDog is sleek and futuristic — even a little menacing. Renders of the machine make it look like the protagonist in a sci-fi TV show, pacing up stairs and appearing silhouetted in doorways. Inevitable comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;’s “Metalhead” episode will be made, as they always are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRgGwN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10694343"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMLry"&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog is nimble enough to perform backflips, can trot along at speeds of 3.2m/s (compared to Spot’s 3.9m/s), and weights 3kg (compared to Spot’s 5.2kg). CyberDog is powered by Nvidia’s Jetson Xavier AI platform and is equipped with an array of cameras and sensors. These include touch sensors, a GPS module, an ultra-wide-angle fisheye lens, and Intel’s RealSense D450 camera for depth-sensing. These components enable the robot to navigate semi-autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5yjEh"&gt;“CyberDog can analyze its surroundings in real-time, create navigational maps, plot its destination, and avoid obstacles. Coupled with human posture and face recognition tracking, CyberDog is capable of following its owner and darting around obstructions,” says Xiaomi. The machine can also respond to voice commands, including recognizing wake words and instructions, or it can be controlled using a connected smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlTNxN"&gt;CyberDog also has three USB-C ports and one HDMI port, which Xiaomi says can be used to customize its hardware. The company suggests lidar sensors, panoramic cameras, and search lights could all be added to the robot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5gkTHk6jHTTN7KQPV3TTBxRQAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773144/CyberDog_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s CyberDog has a very similar design to Boston Dynamic’s Spot robot. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ug70ol"&gt;The release of CyberDog by Xiaomi is very interesting, though not necessarily as a product in its own right. Instead, it says a lot about the current robotics landscape and the accessibility of this tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpkt4b"&gt;Boston Dynamics popularized the quadrupedal format for robots, and companies around the world are now exploring exactly how and where such machines can be deployed effectively. The price of this hardware has been falling though, allowing for new use-cases to be explored. Earlier this year, Chinese robotics firm Unitree released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527413/tiny-robot-dog-unitree-robotics-go1"&gt;quadrupedal bot that cost just $2,700&lt;/a&gt;, and Xiaomi’s own CyberDog undercuts that again. Obviously, the capability of these machines will not be identical, but broader access to the technology will show whether it’s worth these firms pursuing at all. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8yqk4y"&gt;Democrats are calling on some of the largest gaming companies to better protect children by extending new UK design rules to children in the US. The regulations could ban companies from selling in-game loot boxes to minors, among other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrig6L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_game_letters_-_combined.pdf"&gt;In letters to a dozen major gaming companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Blizzard, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Riot, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) pressed executives to extend new UK design regulations to children in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GtOFw"&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children and teens in the 21st century,” the lawmakers wrote. “As we work towards that goal, we urge you to extend to American children and teens any privacy enhancements that you implement to comply with the AADC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvVsVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSPE5"&gt;The new UK rules, called the “Age Appropriate Design Code,” are set to roll out next month, applying to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, the new rules force companies to design their products in the “best interests” of children, offer stricter privacy settings and policies for different age groups, and restrict “nudging techniques” often used to encourage users to continue using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdAClo"&gt;The UK law does not extend to children in the US, but in Tuesday’s letters, lawmakers called on the 12 companies to voluntarily apply these same protections to Americans. Notably, the lawmakers argued that the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s (ESRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;loot box guidance&lt;/a&gt; does not go far enough in protecting children from “manipulation” associated with these in-game purchases and that the companies should create stricter regulations in compliance with the new UK rules in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3IWwk"&gt;“The prevalence of micro-transactions—often encouraged through nudging— have led to high credit card bills for parents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Loot boxes go one step further, encouraging purchase before a child knows what the ‘bundle’ contains— akin to gambling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZZNV"&gt;The US already has some laws protecting children’s privacy — most notably the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, authored by Markey. But the law only applies to children under the age of 12. The UK rules extend to minors under the age of 18. Earlier this year, Castor reintroduced her &lt;a href="https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403677"&gt;“Kids PRIVCY Act”&lt;/a&gt; which includes elements of the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Specifically, the bill would prohibit behavioral ad targeting to children and force companies to design their products in the best interests of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q73Z38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CTi4Nv"&gt;We’re also inviting the next generation of creators to join us.

    <title>TCL announces new 6-series and 5-series TVs that come with Google TV instead of Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TsVhJe5TqlZKcilBMKh4pTS3QcM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704022/IMG_1105.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMUdnH"&gt;TCL has long been the flag bearer of Roku TVs. The company’s 6-series is one of the best-performing sets you can buy for under $1,000. It features a fantastic picture with the help of Mini LED backlighting — TCL beat Samsung and LG to implementing that technology — and quantum dot HDR color. The 5-series and 4-series Roku TVs are no slouches either in their respective pricing tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urAnGl"&gt;But now TCL is taking a step that could dramatically shake up the US TV market: it’s expanding beyond Roku and will release updated versions of its most popular TVs that come with Google TV on board. The software that debuted on Google’s 2020 Chromecast (and also runs on recent TVs from Sony) will now be offered on the latest 5-series and 6-series TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14EAlh"&gt;I recently spoke with some of TCL’s executives who made it abundantly clear that the company is not transitioning to Google TV &lt;em&gt;instead&lt;/em&gt; of Roku or walking away from its longtime partner. Rather, TCL expects that the TV operating system landscape will take after smartphones and eventually consolidate down to two choices: Roku OS and Google TV. TCL wants to offer consumers the choice of either one, and the existing 6-series and 5-series Roku TVs will remain for sale. That stance seems just a bit dismissive of Samsung’s Tizen and LG’s webOS TV platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlY0T4"&gt;The Google TV versions retain the same price points as the Roku models — but there are some tweaks and upgrades since they’re newer hardware. For one, the TCL 6-series with Google TV will be capable of 4K at 120Hz, an improvement over the Roku model, which can only reach 120Hz at 1440p. That’s a big deal for PS5 and Xbox Series gamers. The Google TV version comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports (one of which is eARC), with two additional HDMI 2.0 ports. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E2rWF6C3E3SnkkLSGpiwnfYm2cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773200/IMG_1100.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 6-series with Google TV has two full-spec HDMI 2.1 ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3hdixt"&gt;Both the 6-series and 5-series with Google TV will also support HDR10+. And in what some people might perceive as a controversial decision, TCL is outfitting its Google TVs with always-listening microphones that can be used for voice commands. There’s a physical switch on the back of the TVs to disable the microphones if you prefer to stick to the remote’s press-and-hold method to Google Assistant controls. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qFNuGb6X0G8c93JBvuryWBohoAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773206/IMG_1098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s Google TVs have always-listening mics located at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LFXHVo5GmQoIBlMxTOv5iQYUEng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773199/IMG_1097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a physical switch to turn off the TV’s built-in microphones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HbmU9e"&gt;The lower-priced 5-series doesn’t include 4K at 120Hz, but it still gives you full-array local dimming and both variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode when gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeDxwB"&gt;TCL is highlighting Google TV’s content-focused interface, which differs significantly from the grid-of-apps Roku homescreen UX. Here’s what the company says the new software offers customers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CNQx3I"&gt;With the addition of Google TV, TCL’s latest offerings will also come with notable features like the For You tab where users will find new content based on their interests, across their streaming services; the Watchlist to fine tune recommendations by clicking on content and saving to watch later, even from a browser or phone; and the Live TV integrated channel guide where recommendations for streaming content are visible alongside live program listings. In addition, quickly finding TV shows and movies by title, genre, and even actors, is made possible by pressing the dedicated Google Assistant button on the remote and saying the command; or simply make Google TV the hub of any smart home by easily controlling your connected devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="p3AaZZ"&gt;Preorders for TCL’s first Google TVs in the US begin today: I’ve included their Best Buy links below. The company tells me that the new 5-series will ship within the next couple weeks, and the 6-series should follow shortly after that. A 75-inch model of the 6-series is expected to come later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QRJge"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 6-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695675415496976" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695712892295817" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $999&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgFuzC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TCL 5-series with Google TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695744417216631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch: $1,299&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695761875439072" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch: $899&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695795187643160" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch: $649&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748695826735635451" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch: $599&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u11BwsVPeCrrNhukCEvyA6KxDzQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773307/IMG_1101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The remote for the TCL Google TVs is quite different from the Roku remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Ljud"&gt;It’s worth noting that TCL’s very best TVs, which include the 8-series and 8K-capable 6-series, will still exclusively run Roku OS in North America. But regardless, I’m curious to see how this will shake out over the coming months. As I said earlier, TCL has always been the premier Roku TV brand. The company’s vertical integration and in-house panel production has put it in a place where, for example, Amazon’s Fire TVs from Toshiba and other brands have been unable to compete in terms of picture quality. Now, Google TV is about to get a huge boost by serving as the backbone of that impressive hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HRWSms"&gt;There are upgrades here (particularly on the 6-series) that might push people toward the newer Google TV TCLs instead of the previous Roku sets. But you’ll also have those people who have sworn off ever bringing a TV with microphones into their home — mute switch or not. I’m looking forward to taking a closer look at TCL’s Google TVs in the weeks ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Beats Studio Buds are already $20 off at Amazon and Walmart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vcoTzDBjvW18DhQigmIWvGClqe4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703765/DSCF4152_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Typically $150, Amazon and Walmart are both taking $20 off the recently-released earbuds. | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qh5ECz"&gt;The Beats name carries quite a bit of clout, which is perhaps the reason Apple is able to sell headphones and earbuds that fall under the Beats umbrella for a premium, regardless of their performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533158/beats-studio-buds-features-price"&gt;Beat Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a great case in point. The fitness-focused earbuds lack wireless charging and suffer from lackluster noise cancellation, however, they typically command a higher price than some of the like-minded competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJri1v"&gt;Thankfully, they’re currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Studio-Buds-True-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Black%2F643659699&amp;amp;partnerpropertyid=1065598" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $20 off, the first discount the colorful earbuds have received since making their debut in June. Noted flaws aside, the Beats Studio Buds still tout a comfortable, stem-less design and satisfying sound for the price, along with USB-C charging and support for a handful of Android-specific features — a hallmark we hope Apple brings to more devices in the future. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RN8hwK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10693512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmGDy1"&gt;The latest iPad Air is, arguably, the best tablet for most people right now. The well-built, midrange device adopts some design elements from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;2018 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and is compatible with many of the same devices, yet it’s not nearly as big or expensive as its larger sibling. Nonetheless, it comes with a terrific display, USB-C connectivity, and Apple’s A14 Bionic processor, a chip that promises to provide ample speed for years to come. Normally $600, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748634717956796230#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are selling the 10.9-inch iPad Air with Wi-Fi and 64GB of storage for $500, matching the best price we’ve seen on the 2020 iPad Air this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

While still occasionally pricier than similarly specced Chromebooks, Google’s sensible 13.3-inch laptop remains one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, with good battery life, an excellent keyboard, and an attractive, understated design that makes the most of its sturdy magnesium chassis.

    <title>Xiaomi announces Mix 4 with under-display camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jo5Uu8jPjslxptbyKiozr17qA9E=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703667/mix4.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pf5xvq"&gt;Xiaomi has announced the Mix 4, the first phone in the Mi Mix series to be announced in nearly three years. The Mix phones have always been about bezel-less designs with seamless screens, and the Mix 4 carries on that idea by commercializing a technology that Xiaomi has been working on for a long time: a selfie camera that’s located directly under the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PziUla"&gt;Xiaomi calls this CUP (Camera Under Panel) technology, though it’s similar to the under-display selfie cameras we’ve seen from other companies. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608812/oppo-next-generation-under-screen-camera-tech-announced"&gt;Oppo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;ZTE&lt;/a&gt;’s latest efforts, the Mix 4’s screen has a 400ppi area that lets light pass through to the selfie camera, which Xiaomi describes as “virtually invisible.” The camera is 20 megapixels and the display is a 6.67-inch 120Hz 1080p curved OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ky1XD1"&gt;Xiaomi says CUP is “a technology iterated through three major generations, five years, sixty patents, a $77 million investment, and hundreds of engineers.” Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405241/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-no-notch-hole-punch-2021-mass-production"&gt;pledged&lt;/a&gt; to start mass-producing smartphones with its third-generation under-display camera technology in 2021, so it’s making good on that promise with the Mix 4. Xiaomi first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650166/xiaomi-under-display-selfie-camera-weibo-teaser-mi-9-notch-hole-punch"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; its take on the idea back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JS4R8h5931q5lgahRKBbyHVS2HU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773053/Xiaomi_MIX_4_13.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBQ0Ih"&gt;The Mix 4 is the first phone to be announced with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550723/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-cpu-ai-performance-mwc-2021"&gt;Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 888 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, a speed-bumped version of the flagship 888 chip with a top clock speed of 3GHz. (Honor did already say that it would use the 888 Plus in the Magic 3, but that phone is yet to be revealed in full.) The processor is paired with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQ1Axr"&gt;The camera system centers around a 108-megapixel Samsung HMX sensor, suggesting similar or identical performance to the slightly outdated but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;still pretty good Mi 11&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also a 13-megapixel ultrawide and an 8-megapixel 5x periscope telephoto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tajwxO"&gt;The Mix 4 has a 4,500mAh battery that can charge at up to 120W wired and 50W wireless. This isn’t Xiaomi’s first phone with 120W fast-charging, but it might be the fastest — Xiaomi claims the battery will get a full charge in under 15 minutes, compared to 23 minutes for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363317/xiaomi-mi-10-ultra-announcement-twitter-fast-charging"&gt;last year’s Mi 10 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;. 50W wireless charging, meanwhile, will take 28 minutes to get you to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgxMRA"&gt;Xiaomi will only confirm a mainland China launch for the Mix 4 so far. Preorders will start there tomorrow with general availability coming on August 16th, and the pricing starts at 4,999 yuan (~$770) for an 8GB/128GB model, going up to 6,299 yuan (~$970) for 12GB/512GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue’s $50 Icepop mic brings subtle improvements to some Logitech headsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech Blue Icepop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aLnFia2LUTCk6Z_5BKyiMTHqWk=/0x0:2056x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703641/gproxicepop1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop is compatible with the G Pro X Wireless, the G Pro X, G Pro, and Astro A40.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kGagu1"&gt;Not content with cornering the market with its USB microphones, the latest product from Logitech-owned Blue is a detachable mic called the Icepop. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluemic.com%2Ficepop&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22612829%2Flogitech-blue-icepop-microphone-g-pro-x-wireless-gaming-headset" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s a $49.99 upgrade&lt;/a&gt; that can replace the default mics included with Logitech’s G Pro X Wireless gaming headset, the G Pro X, the G Pro, as well as Astro’s A40 headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5Gjo1"&gt;Logitech is promising that the Icepop will deliver enhanced “broadcast-quality” performance with its 10mm electret condenser mic. It has a built-in pop filter that aims to eliminate those hard “b” or “p” sounds that can be a giveaway that you’re using a lesser mic, and its unidirectional cardioid pickup is said to eliminate background noise and focus more on your voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXxObM"&gt;Installing the Icepop is as simple as plugging it into one of the compatible headsets’ 3.5mm mic jack. Logitech sent over a G Pro X Wireless for testing, and there were no firmware or software updates required to get it working. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech Icepop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9bdgKTqn0l3vB7nvlSUPfQ9mgQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766156/gproxicepop2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Icepop plugs into one of the compatible mics via 3.5mm jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NfHzF7"&gt;Now, yours truly isn’t a podcast host, so I don’t have preferred voice settings locked in for the times when I need to jump into a voice chat. But to illustrate how the recording quality differs between the Icepop and the default mic that ships with the G Pro X Wireless, I recorded several samples to show what they sound like with and without the special Blue Voice features built into Logitech’s G Hub software. If you’re using the Astro A40, you won’t be able to access the Blue Voice features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6kwBK"&gt;The first is a clean feed from the G Pro X Wireless default mic with no special voice presets via Blue Voice. (My voice sounds a little dull with this mic, and it’s relatively easy to hear my air conditioner running in the background once my voice stops near the end.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrE8Ks"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766084/gproxwirelessdefaultmic.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sslJH6"&gt;Here’s the default mic again but with Blue Voice turned on with the “Broadcaster 1” preset activated. (Background noise has been hushed, and my voice has much more depth, though it’s still not particularly warm-sounding.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hkig1g"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766095/gproxwirelessdefaultmicbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDHFj0"&gt;Now, here’s how the Icepop sounds without any tweaks made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k8Dq2y"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766097/icepopdefault.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bVQrg2"&gt;Lastly, here’s how the Icepop sounds with the same “Broadcaster 1” preset turned on in Blue Voice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sFSIms"&gt;&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766100/icepopbluevoice.mp3" type="audio/mp3"&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ehVM6u"&gt;After listening to the samples over and over, the difference in quality between Logitech’s default mic and the Icepop, while noticeable, isn’t as apparent as I was expecting considering its $49.99 cost. Of course, it’s not reasonable to expect this add-on to rival standalone microphones that cost more, and there are some things that I like about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5iQ6Y"&gt;The Icepop does a better job of accurately capturing what my voice sounds like in real life, replacing some of that shrill effect from the default mic with warmth. And those “b” and “p” sounds do sound great, as advertised, though I was surprised to hear it fumble a little when I made “x” and “s” sounds. That could be my slight lisp or it could be a flaw with the tuning or a limitation of the mic. Turning on the Blue Voice feature fixed most of my complaints, but I was expecting a little more out of the raw feed captured through the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tPpiV"&gt;Given that voices have so much range and that hearing is, of course, subjective, I recommend giving this a try if you’re curious and already own one of the compatible headsets. Depending on how you like to gussy up your voice for chats, streams, or podcast appearances, you might be able to get some solid performance out of the Icepop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0mvab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxoabH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsutNN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jItH8BcKBYolBcYJSTILEKQg-sg=/0x150:3600x2550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703584/HP_Chrome_Family_August_2021_new_Shot2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Chromebase AiO (left) and Chromebook x2 11 (right) Chrome OS computers.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eEQVW6"&gt;HP is announcing two new Chrome OS computers for its consumer-focused lineup. The first is the Chromebase AiO, an all-in-one desktop computer with a screen that can rotate from landscape to portrait. The second is the Chromebook x2 11, a lightweight detachable that can easily shift from laptop to tablet modes. The company is also announcing a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183975/google-works-with-chromebook-badge-accessories-chargers-keyboards-mice"&gt;Works With Chromebook-certified&lt;/a&gt; 24-inch USB-C monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WF2kW"&gt;All three new products are designed for students, families, and general consumers. The Chromebase AiO will be available at HP, Amazon, and Best Buy this month, while the Chromebook x2 11 will be available from Best Buy this month and from HP’s website in October. Both computers start at $599.99 for base configurations. The M24fd USB-C monitor will be available in October from HP directly for $249.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="K1Q2tY"&gt;HP Chromebase AiO&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/55n2Ny3lr-nlyjude26Lm2EMzvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769857/HP_Chromebase_AiO_FrontFace_Articulation_Hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s 21.5-inch touchscreen display can rotate from landscape to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lTvLkm"&gt;The $600-and-up Chromebase AiO is an all-in-one computer with a rotating display — a first for all-in-one Chrome OS desktops. Its 21.5-inch touchscreen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and it comes with either an Intel Pentium Gold processor or a 10th Gen Core i3 chip. The base Pentium Gold configuration has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of eMMC storage; you’ll be able to get up to 16GB RAM and a 256GB SSD with an upgraded model, but oddly, there isn’t a configuration with 8GB of RAM available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UT6pLi"&gt;The conical base of the Chromebase AiO is made of aluminum and houses dual 5-watt speakers and four ports — two USB-C and two USB-A — as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack. A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calling. You can selectively disable the camera or microphones with the Chromebase’s built-in shutter. Included in the box is a wireless mouse and keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hqf83O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A first look at HP’s new all-in-one Chrome OS desktop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qA2-s3L2totXG7x7kVdypZnO_ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769858/HP_Chromebase_AiO_RearFace_Landscape.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase AiO’s ports are located on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QyhvY0"&gt;Along with its ability to rotate from landscape to portrait, the screen can be tilted back 20 degrees, though there is no height adjustment. HP says portrait mode makes it easier to read long webpages or work with documents. I had a chance to test out a pre-production version of the Chromebase AiO to see how useful the rotating screen is in person — you can read my impressions &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379888"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Qualcomm-powered Chromebook x2 11 comes with a detachable keyboard, kickstand, and rechargeable pen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zlTP06"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 is an 11-inch Chrome OS tablet that comes with a magnetic keyboard and kickstand to use it in laptop mode. It has Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7c processor (the first-generation chip, not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451392/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-arm-processor"&gt;more recently announced second-gen version&lt;/a&gt;) and optional 4G LTE connectivity (but not 5G). HP claims it will last up to 11 hours between charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QFfGd"&gt;The 11-inch touchscreen display features a 3:2 aspect ratio and 2160 x 1440 resolution. The tablet itself is made of aluminum and has two USB-C ports for charging and data transfer and a microSD card reader. A fingerprint reader is integrated into the power button for biometric logins, while dual speakers provide audio. Unfortunately, HP wasn’t able to find room for a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFg0Um"&gt;A 5-megapixel camera is available for video calls, while an 8-megapixel camera is on the back for photo taking or document scanning.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The x2 11’s display features a productivity-friendly 3:2 aspect ratio.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KBH4Gm"&gt;The Chromebook x2 11 will be available with either 64GB or 128GB of storage paired with 8GB of RAM. The LTE-equipped models come with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tHq8L"&gt;Included in the box is a wireless pen that magnetically attaches to the side of the x2 11 to recharge. It can be used with Google’s new Cursive progressive web app for note-taking and sketching. The x2 11 will be the first device on the market with the Cursive app; Google says it will be made available to other Chrome OS devices in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9wBhUA"&gt;HP M24fd USB-C monitor&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3RiO0zoGwLCV6Ki13OEz1yI6dW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769865/HP_M24fd_USB_C_Monitor_FrontLeft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M24fd USB-C is certified to be plug-and-play with Chromebooks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4k4k2w"&gt;The M24fd is a USB-C monitor that has Google’s Works With Chromebook certification for simple setup with a Chrome OS laptop. It can provide up to 65 watts of power to the connected laptop over the USB-C cable, or you can connect it to other devices over HDMI (1.4) or VGA. There are also two USB-A ports on the monitor for other peripherals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQMR87"&gt;The 23.8-inch display is IPS and has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. HP says it has horizontal and vertical viewing angles of 178 degrees and supports AMD’s FreeSync tech for more fluid gameplay, with refresh rates up to 75Hz. Brightness is rated up to 300 nits and there is an anti-glare coating on the display itself. HP claims up to 99 percent coverage of the sRGB color space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/04X3gLPAJQeX6ZJJ5n8sAjP7vhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769866/HP_M24fd_USB_C_Monitor_Rear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to a USB-C port, the M24fd has HDMI, VGA, and two USB-A ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UVSSah"&gt;The M24fd’s detachable stand doesn’t rotate like the Chromebase AiO, but it does allow for tilt adjustment from negative 5 to positive 25 degrees. There is no height adjustment, however.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new Chromebase AiO has a screen that rotates from portrait to landscape</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMU1qTxhw13HQCUqvxEc3o9oQzw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69703548/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Chromebase AiO all-in-one computer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWaqDM"&gt;HP has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"&gt;just announced three new Chrome OS-focused products&lt;/a&gt;: a detachable tablet, a new all-in-one, and a Works With Chromebook-certified monitor. All of them are designed to capitalize on the explosive growth Chrome OS devices have seen over the past year and a half, as many students and families have had to adopt remote schooling. I’ve had a chance to try out a pre-production version of the new Chromebase AiO ahead of the announcement, read on for some first impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypwWDH"&gt;The Chromebase AiO is the first all-in-one Chrome OS desktop with the ability to rotate its screen from landscape to portrait. You can switch modes with just a light push on the corner — the content on the screen will automatically rotate to match the new orientation for you. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hwq2BGzN_LnsqF8q2GpKcR5SdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769958/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Chromebase AiO’s claim to fame is the ability to rotate its display to portrait orientation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d89p4v"&gt;HP claims this makes the Chromebase more versatile and easier to use for scrolling through long webpages or working with long documents. But in practice, I didn’t find the portrait mode very helpful in my day-to-day work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="b8VyHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"HP announces new detachable and all-in-one Chrome OS computers","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/22379829"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ESMkTb"&gt;For starters, whenever I rotated the screen from landscape to portrait or vice versa, my window arrangement would get lost, forcing me to reset everything. It might be fine if all you use is a single window, but the 21.5-inch screen is large enough to invite you to open multiple windows for side-by-side comparisons or just better multitasking. This obviously works best when the screen is in landscape mode, but whenever you switch to portrait and back again, you’ll have to rearrange all of your open windows. The 16:9 aspect ratio is fine when the screen is in landscape, but becomes awkwardly tall and long in portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R47RJ3"&gt;Additionally, the built-in webcam is on the long edge of the screen, making it most useful in landscape mode. When the screen is rotated to portrait, the camera is awkwardly off to the side. (It’s effectively the opposite of the problem with the webcam placement on the iPad Pro.) A portrait orientation screen can be very useful as a secondary display, but it doesn’t make as much sense to me for a primary one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6GrpPEGMg4YrmI2w0cnf3gpd_C4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769966/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_18.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The base of the Chromebase AiO is aluminum with light gray fabric and is attractive without being ostentatious.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qe9SlZ"&gt;Though the marquee feature didn’t win me over, the rest of the Chromebase’s design is quite nice. The base is wrapped in attractive fabric, the dual speakers kick out a surprising amount of sound and are clear when used for video calls. The general design is modern, yet understated enough to fit in most home decors. This isn’t a bright yellow iMac, which is probably a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClJCJy"&gt;The screen itself is bright enough for indoor use and is fine for typical productivity or school work, even if its 1080p resolution isn’t the most pixel dense. The touch response is suitable and a nice thing to have if a younger student is using the computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExXJVS"&gt;The model I’ve been able to try out is the mid-tier version with a 10th Gen Core i3 processor and 4GB of RAM. As this is a pre-production model, I haven’t done any formal benchmarking, but in general usage the processor is more than up to the task of running Chrome OS at this resolution, even when I have multiple desktops, windows, and tabs going at the same time. (The only real sluggishness I noticed was when I tried to play 4K YouTube videos.) The RAM, on the other hand, was an unsurprising bottleneck: I frequently had tabs or windows reload in the background, causing me to miss things like email notifications or lose my place in a paused YouTube video. Just 4GB of RAM might be passable on a small tablet where you are likely only working with one window at a time, but on a device with a large screen that invites you to multitask, it’s not enough. The top-spec configuration comes with 16GB of RAM, but I’m not sure why HP isn’t offering one with 8GB, which is enough for most people and doesn’t have the limitations of 4GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ouXbJFS2L0s6En8xygHM3M9BT2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769948/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the Chromebase’s ports are arranged on the back of the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5sxJ1eAwFBdWJCJG7pFrEZGKBJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22769956/dseifert_4699_hp_chromebase_21_5_11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included wireless mouse and keyboard use AAA batteries and connect over Bluetooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRxzm2"&gt;All of the ports on the Chromebase AiO are neatly arranged in a vertical column on the back of the computer and should be plenty for most people. There are two USB-C ports rated at 10Gbps and two USB-A ports rated at 5Gbps and all of them can be used to charge mobile devices. The only inconvenient part of this design is the 3.5mm headphone jack, which requires reaching around the back of the display to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0ghh3"&gt;The included wireless keyboard and mouse are simple, but mostly fine. They run on AAA batteries and connect via Bluetooth. The keyboard is plasticky, but pleasant enough to type on, while the scroll wheel and buttons on the mouse are stiffer than I’d like. Sadly, there’s no biometric authentication on the Chromebase AiO, requiring me to type in a PIN or password to log in each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzqXzo"&gt;HP says the pricing for the Chromebase AiO starts at $599.99, which would be for the model with the lower-tier Pentium Gold chip and slower eMMC storage. The company didn’t have pricing information for the spec tier I was able to test, but the top-tier model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage will sell for $770. If you’re willing to spend that much, the Chromebase AiO might be an interesting desktop to consider, provided Chrome OS meets all of your computing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
