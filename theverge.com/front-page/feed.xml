    <title>Tesla whistleblower Martin Tripp ordered to pay $400,000 to settle hacking case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhkAIKAW-njRZwPssYynnV3SvF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68054219/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tGDtXv"&gt;Martin Tripp, the former Tesla worker who has been embroiled in a bitter legal battle with CEO Elon Musk for over two years, was ordered to pay his former employer $400,000 after admitting to leaking confidential information to a reporter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvjoR9"&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263757/tesla-elon-musk-employee-hack-spying-whistleblower-gigafactory-martin-tripp-drugs"&gt;one of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, in which Tripp, a former process technician, locked horns with the billionaire CEO over allegations that Tesla was wasting a “jaw-dropping” amount of raw material as it ramped up production of the Model 3 sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XeTnH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The settlement is intended to bring an end to one &lt;s&gt;﻿&lt;/s&gt;of the more sordid stories at Tesla&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="szRtQi"&gt;Musk later accused Tripp of “sabotage” and personally ordered investigators to hack Tripp’s phone and spy on his messages. Tesla even misled local police about a potential mass shooting by Tripp at the company’s Nevada factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEeBr9"&gt;But in the end, Tripp came out on the losing side. The payment is part of a proposed settlement to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484030/tesla-sues-employee-hacking-theft-leaking"&gt;a lawsuit filed by Tesla in 2018&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Tripp hacked the electric car company’s system and transferred “gigabytes” of data to third parties. As part of the agreement, Tripp admitted to violating laws related to trade secrets and computer crimes when he &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-scrap-waste-high-gigafactory-2018-5?r=UK"&gt;told a &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla was wasting a significant amount of raw materials during production of its Model 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8XleL"&gt;Tripp also agreed to pay $25,000 to Tesla for continuing to reveal information about the company, despite being ordered to stop by a judge. Tripp had been publishing a large number of documents and videos online, including many under a confidentiality order in the case. In August, Tripp fired his lawyers and set about representing himself in the case. It was also revealed that a Tesla short seller, &lt;a href="http://www.cablecarcapital.com/"&gt;The Funicular Fund&lt;/a&gt;, was financing Tripp’s legal defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bOk1Aq"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21446587/judge-dismiss-defamation-employee-tesla-leak-elon-musk-model-3"&gt;a judge dismissed Tripp’s defamation case&lt;/a&gt; against Tesla, in which the former technician accused the company of spreading false rumors about him. After Tripp filed for whistleblower status with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Musk emailed a reporter at &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-13/when-elon-musk-tried-to-destroy-tesla-whistleblower-martin-tripp?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; telling them&lt;/a&gt; a tipster had contacted Tesla to say that Tripp might “come back and shoot people,” at the Nevada Gigafactory. The local sheriff determined the threat was not real, but Tesla issued a press release, which was picked up by several media outlets. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this video about an AI system that can predict how proteins fold</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A diagram comparing an AlphaFold prediction with an identified protein shape, showing 99.09 percent Global Distance Test accuracy." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AVDQgynabdlgPnprYiR4bBFrd2U=/108x0:1262x769/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68052988/global_distance_result.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An AlphaFold prediction compared against an identified protein.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: DeepMind&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUYngK"&gt;Within any living organism, there are thousands of different proteins, each with its own unique shape. For decades, the exact formation of those shapes has been a pain for scientists to figure out. How exactly does a protein, which starts as a string of amino acids, fold itself into the funky 3D shapes you might recognize from diagrams? AlphaFold, an &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphafold"&gt;AI from DeepMind&lt;/a&gt;, may have an answer. It can predict, with heretofore unseen accuracy, the shape a protein will take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBzmn7"&gt;AlphaFold was put to the test in a global competition called Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction, or CASP, which DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis calls the “Olympics of protein folding” &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg7WjuFs8F4"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt;. During the competition, systems like AlphaFold are given the amino acid strings for proteins with shapes that have already been identified through previous experiments but haven’t been published yet. Judges compare the protein shapes produced by the systems with what they know the shapes should be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A gif of two rotating protein fold models made up of curls and swirling lines. AlphaFold’s predictions are overlayed on the models, with 90.7 GDT accuracy on the left and 93.3 GDT accuracy on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLV4q-2KKwiqnXtDBpqLL6LTmY0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22132319/AlphaFold_prediction_comparisons.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: DeepMind&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overlays of protein structures in green with AlphaFold’s predictions in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x6Pb2X"&gt;At the end of the competition, AlphaFold had the most accurate predictions of any CASP participant in its 25-year history by a wide margin. Even the predictions that weren’t accurate enough to be considered “competitive” with experimental results were only a few atom-widths off. The complete data still needs to be peer-reviewed and published, but the DeepMind team is excited about the results so far, saying in a blog post that they are “optimistic about the impact AlphaFold can have on biological research and the wider world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4DX4H"&gt;It can take years in the lab for scientists to identify the shapes of individual proteins. Neural networks like AlphaFold could help speed up biological research and drug development in the future. The AI method isn’t perfect yet, and it won’t be taking over for flesh-and-blood researchers anytime soon, but it could be a major step in the everlasting marathon of scientific advancement. To learn more about AlphaFold and to see a bunch of scientists and engineers getting giddy and fist-pumping over competition results, check out the video below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose adds swipe volume controls to QuietComfort Earbuds and Sport Earbuds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s-SrCqBMZVQwKFnEAD-c7xpLUno=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68050638/IMG_0723-1.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5NCa7"&gt;One of the few complaints I had in my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;review of Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt; was that they lacked onboard volume controls. Well, a few weeks after they went on sale, the company has now resolved that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojhIj6"&gt;In the latest update of the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bose-music/id1364986984"&gt;Bose Music app out today on iOS&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a new volume control option in settings. (Presumably this will be coming to the Android app imminently, as well.) Once you toggle it on, you’ll be able to swipe up and down on the right earbud to adjust how loud the audio is. This feature is available for both the QuietComfort Earbuds and less expensive Sport Earbuds. It’s something that was spotted in early user manuals for the earbuds but was removed before they shipped. I’m glad Bose has quickly moved to add this functionality, as it makes the premium earbuds more well-rounded when it comes to controls. And for Sport Earbuds owners, this means you won’t have to mess with your phone (or Siri or Google Assistant) in the middle of a workout or run if you need to change the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdX1f1"&gt;Bose has also added an (optional) Spotify shortcut to its Noise Canceling Headphones 700. You can now set the headphones to launch Spotify on your mobile device with a tap and hold on the right ear cup. Other headphone makers, including Samsung, have previously added similar quick-access shortcuts to the popular streaming music service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Windows Feature Experience Packs are smaller updates to Windows 10</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Windows 10 stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmwbTtUAXoY-N4tK23JhTiNrFvE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68045021/mswindows1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5LAMcR"&gt;Microsoft has started testing smaller feature updates for Windows 10 in the form of a Windows Feature Experience Pack. The branding appeared inside Windows 10 earlier this year, but Microsoft has only confirmed what the packs will be used for this week. The Windows Feature Experience Pack will be used to “improve certain features and experiences that are now developed independently of the OS,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/11/30/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-1070-0-to-the-beta-channel/"&gt;according to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NHHGJ"&gt;The first feature pack has been released to Windows 10 beta testers this week, and it includes the ability to use the built-in screen snipping app to paste screenshots directly into folders within the File Explorer. The pack also includes a split keyboard mode for 2-in-1 touch devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQvz4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Feature packs are for the smaller parts of Windows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7hQuG1"&gt;Microsoft says feature packs will be delivered to Windows testers much like how existing builds and cumulative updates are delivered. It’s not clear how these feature packs will make their way to consumers and enterprises, though. Feature packs appear to be a new channel for Microsoft to update parts of Windows that aren’t directly controlled by the OS but also aren’t separate apps that are maintained through the Windows Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mq3UyTm8X11siUwYjzX45loIaWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133704/5GjjfSu.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 10’s new built-in snipping tool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RRDZjn"&gt;It could mean we’ll see more regular minor updates to Windows 10 in the coming months and years ahead. Microsoft typically delivers two big Windows 10 updates per year, with one arriving around the April time frame and the other around October. The company has been using a Service Pack-style update model for some Windows 10 updates, including relatively minor changes in one of the updates and bigger changes in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMEdWR"&gt;“By testing this process first with Windows Insiders, we hope to expand the scope and the frequency of releases in the future,” explains Microsoft’s Brandon LeBlanc. “Eventually, Windows Feature Experience Pack updates will get folded into the already existing servicing process for Windows 10 and delivered to customers that way through Windows Update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fh7bJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offer noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-670" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725261146929567782" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725328034162471061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130 at all three retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yHjw-MSSOE9krvMa6cC9qYmHU9s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15993019/akrales_190327_3315_0004.jpg"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $140, which is what this pair of wireless earbuds are currently going for at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021%3Fathcpid%3D482532021%26athpgid%3DathenaItemPage%26athcgid%3Dnull%26athznid%3DPWVUB%26athieid%3Dv0%26athstid%3DCS020%26athguid%3D87fd69df-007-175fac8dc24c1a%26athancid%3Dnull%26athena%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt; Compared to the options above, Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality, noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. The best deal right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot, which has the Apple’s flagship earbuds for $190&lt;/a&gt;.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="guePeD"&gt;Currently, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-fortnite-wildcat-bundle%2F11110423.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo Switch Fortnite Wildcat bundle for $300 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. This bundle includes special art on both the Switch and the console’s dock, a pair of yellow and blue Joy-Cons, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;pre-installed, 2,000 V-Bucks, plus a download code for The Wildcat Bundle. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="pbWPDc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowto&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26lang%3Ddefault" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1720139703165212912" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; receive new supplies of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles fairly regularly, and it’s a good strategy to keep these pages open so you can quickly add one to your cart when they come back in stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lwy57E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=as_li_ss_tl?node=16227130011&amp;amp;pf&amp;amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=cdc1feec68a340047fb6e28d4e61c5b9&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has been sold out of the regular Switch for a while now and is usually among one of the first retailers to sell out when new stock arrives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tUJLvUA3JhGEkMaXYRnoetEh8aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21940650/nintendo_switch_animal_crossing_new_horizons_edition.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Special edition &lt;/em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;em&gt; Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out GameStop. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqBPoZ"&gt;Oddly enough, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frover.ebay.com%2Frover%2F1%2F711-53200-19255-0%2F1%3Fmpre%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebay.com%252Fstr%252Fnintendo%26campid%3D5338421472%26toolid%3D20008&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21257643%2Fnintendo-switch-lite-how-to-buy-in-stock#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo has its own official seller page on eBay&lt;/a&gt;, which usually hosts refurbished Switch consoles, though it has been closed “until further notice” due to the pandemic. Still, that’s worth keeping an eye on, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veAGHSQdVpomFEThPomQmjmS1bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8070145/jbareham_1492_170228_0275.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $65&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=40eaf677c94a1341b4ed7beb385dbb06&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $7&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=a424685866013735203d8722ee49a601&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. There are currently three models to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4vnkg"&gt;The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop at least another $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. The three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E67sPx"&gt;Regardless of which model you choose, all three models support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at the Watch SE, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. But for those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal itself. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is  $179 at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=0d1a72f49279f5c3ff832b7b9721e419&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725327349047065530" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for its normal price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has knocked $20 off the pricing of its black model, bringing it down to $220 ($9 off). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GXmAb3"&gt;Current deals available for the Apple Watch SE include the 44mm size with GPS and cellular for $339 (usually $359) at Amazon. The deal is available in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J63S3CY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J5S19RF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charcoal&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-Cellular-44mm/dp/B08J5SFGQQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The latest high-end model of the Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect the blood oxygen levels in your body.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s Chang’e 5 mission lands on the Moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UkJwbt"&gt;China’s Chang’e 5 mission, tasked with bringing a sample of lunar dirt back to Earth, successfully landed on the Moon on Tuesday, marking the third time that China has placed a robotic spacecraft on the lunar surface. The lander will soon begin digging up samples of lunar soil, which will be returned to our planet later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKIiMq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21594565/china-change-5-mission-lunar-sample-return-long-march-5-launch"&gt;Chang’e 5 launched&lt;/a&gt; from China’s Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on November 23rd, flying to space on top of a Long March 5 rocket. It’s a complex mission consisting of four main spacecraft that will all work together to bring between 2 to 4 kilograms of lunar dirt back to Earth. The quartet traveled to the Moon attached together and got into lunar orbit on November 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YyiTQf"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Separation between lander/ascent vehicle and orbiter/return vehicle of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Change5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Change5&lt;/a&gt; on Lunar orbit. Video taken from the orbiter/return vehicle. &lt;a href="https://t.co/05Q4cfZKbT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/05Q4cfZKbT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 星海 (@starmil_admin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starmil_admin/status/1333238461541847040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AU2HL1"&gt;Two of those four spacecraft include a lander and an ascent vehicle, which are stacked on top of each other. On November 28th, the pair separated from the third spacecraft, Chang’e-5’s service module, which remained in orbit around the Moon. The lander and ascent module touched down on the lunar surface today, &lt;a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-12-01/China-s-Chang-e-5-successfully-lands-on-moon%E2%80%94VSilnSM6J2/index.html"&gt;according to CGTN&lt;/a&gt;, though a time was not provided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gF6Pxv"&gt;Now over the next few days, the lander will use a robotic arm to drill into the lunar dirt and scoop up rocks, storing them inside a sample container. Once the sample is collected, the robotic arm will transfer the container to the ascent module on top of the lander. Then it’ll be time for Chang’e-5’s second takeoff, with the ascent module blasting off from the lander with the sample in tow. The ascent module will meet up with the service module in orbit, and together the spacecraft will head back to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m36Ptv"&gt;The sample will eventually be transferred to the fourth spacecraft, a reentry capsule tasked with bringing the material to the ground. It’s unclear exactly when that landing will take place, but it could occur around December 16th or 17th. China is targeting somewhere in Inner Mongolia for the landing spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsgkPg"&gt;If all goes to plan, China will become one of three countries to bring back samples from the Moon. US astronauts retrieved lunar soil samples during the Apollo missions in the 1960s and 70s, and the former Soviet Union brought back lunar material through a series of robotic missions in the 1970s. In fact, the last successful lunar sample return mission occurred in 1976 with the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission. With Chang’e-5, China could bring the first material back from the Moon in nearly half a century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ec0MSY"&gt;Chang’e-5 isn’t the only mission that could bring rocks from another world to Earth this month. Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission, which has been in space since 2014, is slated to return a sample of material from an asteroid named Ryugu this weekend. That means Earth could get two precious samples of unspoiled space rocks in December 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Libra cryptocurrency project changes name to Diem to distance itself from Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGD17CvSDN1azTOadNrTFI_4RHU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042947/VRG_ILLO_3517_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SCDX9"&gt;The Libra cryptocurrency is &lt;a href="https://www.diem.com/en-us/updates/diem-association/"&gt;getting a new name today&lt;/a&gt;, Diem, in an effort to show that the project has “organizational independence” as it attempts to get regulatory approvals for launch. The project initially received widespread pushback in part because it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682290/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-visa-mastercard-digital-currency-calibra-wallet-announce"&gt;emerged out of Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and in part because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18716326/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-blockchain-irs-starbucks"&gt;its ambitious aims&lt;/a&gt; seemed to threaten traditional government-run financial systems. The independent organization that runs the project, the Libra Association, will now be known as the Diem Association, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-01/facebook-backed-crypto-group-libra-changes-name-to-diem-network"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that its currency will be called the Diem Dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCgb8c"&gt;Diem, as it is now known, has shrunk significantly in scope since it was first announced. Major launch partners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20910330/mastercard-stripe-ebay-facebook-libra-association-withdrawal-cryptocurrency"&gt;pulled support&lt;/a&gt; in quick succession last year because of its controversial nature and the regulatory hurdles it faced due to concerns from lawmakers. At a House Financial Service Committee hearing last year, Congress members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20929313/mark-zuckerberg-hearing-congress-libra-calibra-facebook-maxine-waters"&gt;expressed significant distrust of Facebook&lt;/a&gt; as they questioned company CEO Mark Zuckerberg about the project’s goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OsJB1f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Diem is supposed to offer “instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvfP55"&gt;The project is now rumored to launch in a much more limited form. According to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cfe4ca11-139a-4d4e-8a65-b3be3a0166be"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cryptocurrency could debut as a single coin backed by the dollar, with an initial launch as early as January 2021. Libra was initially meant to be a single coin pegged to multiple currencies for stability that could be traded in place of them; it was later changed to also offer multiple coins that would each be backed by a different currency. Those coins would be “a complement to, not a replacement for, domestic currencies,” the organization wrote in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgoGo2"&gt;“The Diem project will provide a simple platform for fintech innovation to thrive and enable consumers and businesses to conduct instantaneous, low-cost, highly secure transactions,” Stuart Levey, Diem Association CEO, said in a press release today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmsKYN"&gt;Facebook initially pitched Libra as, essentially, a mainstream cryptocurrency that could be spent online or offline, much like the dollar. It was meant to make digitally transferring money quicker and easier than it is today, and companies like Facebook would be able to offer financial services around it. Facebook initially announced plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682838/facebook-digital-wallet-calibra-libra-cryptocurrency-kevin-weil-david-marcus-interview"&gt;a digital wallet&lt;/a&gt;, called Calibra, that could offer these services, with the company positioning Calibra as its means for turning its investment in the project into a potential moneymaker. The wallet app has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270437/facebook-calibra-novi-rename-digital-wallet"&gt;been renamed&lt;/a&gt; Novi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gOqW2"&gt;The whole thing was, frankly, fairly dense, and it’s been hard to tell how much if any of it would pan out in reality. Fears that it would pan out have clearly been effective in neutralizing some of the group’s aims, though. It’s not entirely clear what Diem will launch, whenever it does launch, but the group is trying to make it sound less menacing than the Facebook-controlled dollar replacement many initially saw it as.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzpWuk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 1st, 11:05AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated to mention the “Diem Dollar” branding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facial recognition systems are getting better at recognizing masked faces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRwEJUboU4F3zDCi8sKh5yyETFA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68042773/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvJXiF"&gt;Facial recognition algorithms are getting better at recognizing faces in masks, according to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.IR.8331"&gt;data published on Tuesday by the National Institute for Standards and Technology&lt;/a&gt; (NIST). Drawing on independent testing of more than 150 separate facial recognition algorithms, the new report suggests masks may not be as big a problem for facial recognition systems as initially thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Aqbi5"&gt;Vendors voluntarily submit their facial recognition algorithms to NIST for testing as part of the Facial Recognition Vendor Test (FRVT). The institute publishes results of those tests on a rolling basis as each algorithm is submitted. When NIST &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344751/facial-recognition-face-masks-accuracy-nist-study"&gt;first examined masks’ effect on facial recognition&lt;/a&gt; in July, it found that algorithms weren’t great at identifying faces with masks. Unsurprisingly, it’s harder to recognize a face when the nose and mouth are covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKhIMx"&gt;NIST’s reports focus on false non-match rates (FNMR), a measure of how many matching faces slip through the algorithm without triggering an alert. In July, the error rate for some algorithms spiked to between 5 and 50 percent when they were confronted with images of masked people. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JHu8W1LOgdZ9q18hXDDMytjy4M0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22133351/Screen_Shot_2020_12_01_at_9.04.08_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NIST&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chart from the NIST report shows consistent improvement across vendors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m2b6y8"&gt;But the pandemic has given developers plenty of time to focus on the mask problem, and NIST’s data shows that facial recognition algorithms are getting better at working with masked faces. Without masks, the best algorithms have a false match rate of roughly 0.3 percent — but that number still rises to 5 percent when high-coverage masks are worn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XBb9L"&gt;“While a few pre-pandemic algorithms still remain within the most accurate on masked photos, some developers have submitted algorithms after the pandemic showing significantly improved accuracy and are now among the most accurate in our test,” the report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuZJTU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt_facemask.html"&gt;NIST’s public leaderboard for facial recognition tests&lt;/a&gt; bears out this claim. Eight different algorithms now hold false non-match rates below 0.05 percent. Six of those eight were submitted to NIST after the first report was published in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUvksh"&gt;The authors note a number of limitations to the study. In particular, while the tests drew on photos of real visa holders and actual border-crossing photos, they did not use actual images of masked faces. For the sake of expediency, NIST researchers instead applied masks digitally to ensure consistency across the sample. As a result, “we were not able to pursue an exhaustive simulation of the endless variations in color, design, shape, texture, bands, and ways masks can be worn,” the report notes. The digital mask was a blue surgical covering the full width of the face, but testers noted that performance varied considerably depending on how high the mask was placed on the face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCD2Ym"&gt;The US employs facial recognition at both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17427150/facial-recognition-vehicle-face-system-homeland-security-immigration-customs"&gt;land&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484581/us-airport-facial-recognition-departing-flights-biometric-exit"&gt;air borders&lt;/a&gt;, matching travelers against their visa or passport photos as part of the biometric exit program. The NIST data is drawn from visa holders specifically who have few privacy rights over biometric information collected during the immigration process.&lt;/p&gt;
