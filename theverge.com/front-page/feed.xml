    <title>Netflix is making The Trial of the Chicago 7 free on YouTube for 48 hours</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F4mfjN"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Trial of the Chicago 7 &lt;/em&gt;will be available for free on its YouTube channel for 48 hours, starting on Friday, February 19th, at 12AM PT, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-whole-world-was-and-is-watching"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company (&lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-the-trial-of-the-chicago-7-free-on-youtube-48-hours-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Writer and director Aaron Sorkin said the movie is being shown for free to “commemorate the anniversary of the verdict in this historic trial,” and he praised the people depicted in the movie as “the real patriots who inspired a generation — actually, generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufL1QF"&gt;The film centers on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven"&gt;the eight Vietnam war protestors&lt;/a&gt; who were charged with inciting a riot and conspiracy for demonstrating during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Sorkin is no stranger to political subject matter, notably working on &lt;em&gt;The West Wing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt;, even though he’s perhaps better known for films like &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOK5o"&gt;This isn’t the first time Netflix has made some of its content free on YouTube. Last April, it made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;several of its documentaries available on the platform&lt;/a&gt;, many of which seem to still be up, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knock Down the House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and episodes of nature docuseries &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtXC_n6X6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Planet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKa8EA"&gt;Netflix providing its original movies and shows for free on YouTube could be a way to introduce people to its content, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;it no longer offers free trials for its service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCfKBi"&gt;If you’re interested in seeing the movie but don’t have Netflix, it’ll be available on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw"&gt;Netflix’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hM2ZmX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVb6EdKDBfU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to easily install the Android 12 developer preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9HBAEQVKp6e725lbGLfEysg0bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66886289/jbareham_181010_2989_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhtBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google released the first of its &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer previews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so we’ve updated the info in this post to be relevant if you want to install it on your phone. The instructional photos might include a mention of Android 11, but we’ve ensured the steps are still accurate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEa7Ku"&gt;You can try out the Android 12 developer preview software right now if you have a Pixel 3 or later, but it’s understandable if the idea of flashing your device to install the OS is intimidating. It can be a tricky process, and the steps differ slightly depending on what phone you have and what kind of computer you’re going to use to download the software. But Google itself makes this process much more streamlined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6mztn"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download"&gt;Android Flash Tool&lt;/a&gt; is a web application that handles most of the steps of flashing for you. There are a few steps that you’ll need to do yourself before the new software can be installed, which we’ll walk you through below, but Google’s tool basically eliminates most of the hassle and complexity that makes it easy to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnBR1D"&gt;There are a few important notes to make up here at the top. First, once you flash your phone with the developer preview, your device will get all future developer preview and beta updates over the air. In other words, you won’t need to flash your phone again when new builds of Android 12 are released. Just head to your system settings and fetch an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58Olby"&gt;The second note is just your standard disclaimer that you do this at your own risk. This is unfinished software, and installing it could lead to malfunctions with your device or to software that you usually use. And depending on settings that you adjust in the Android Flash Tool, you might have to wipe all of the data from your phone. So proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGG-Z2OspcNqk1d8fR6JICl6vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19303885/vpavic_191018_3725_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SPg2X6"&gt;Is my phone compatible with Android 12?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSEp5"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is compatible with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3A, Pixel 3A XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, and the Pixel 5. It’s possible that Google will broaden the list of devices supported by Android 12 in the upcoming beta, but for now, you’ll need one of those phones to get the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nWnG91"&gt;What browser do I need to use to flash my phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fwlb97"&gt;Google says that you can use any browser that supports the WebUSB API, which is supported by Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge version 79 and later. The Android Flash Tool works with all the major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Chrome OS, and Windows 10, though browser compatibility may vary depending on your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wxx6Rr"&gt;Step 1: Activate these three settings on your Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BMI7cK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable the Developer Options menu&lt;/strong&gt; in your phone. First, open the Settings app. For phones running Android 8 (Oreo), click System. Otherwise, if your phone has Android 7 (Nougat) or later, scroll down to About Phone, then find Build Number. Tap Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dO4knj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Turn on USB debugging&lt;/strong&gt; (this lets your phone and computer communicate via USB) within the Developer Options menu. To do this, head to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Developer Options. You’ll find USB debugging with just a little scrolling down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElHgpn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable OEM unlocking&lt;/strong&gt;. This option is also part of the Developer Options menu, further up the page than where you found USB debugging. If that option isn’t available for you to enable, that might be because it’s already enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csscsUs89Ir1CKE5Rd299XIo9bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213698/vpavic_190503_3404_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HzryhV"&gt;Step 2: Connect your phone to your computer and get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OSeB6k"&gt;If you use Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb"&gt;you’ll need to install this driver&lt;/a&gt; first for your phone to be recognized.  People using macOS or Linux don’t need a driver. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="weswdD"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. Then &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/preview/dp1"&gt;visit this page to proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NbuEfq"&gt;The Android Flash Tool will ask for permission to access ADB keys in a pop-up window, which is necessary to install software on your phone. You’ll need to tap “OK” to proceed with this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android Flash Tool for Android 11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3SlZ5sAdLEg5Bm14ClFdb7XjIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014977/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need to hit OK to proceed with the installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WpBss1"&gt;Click “Select device.” Your device should appear in a pop-up window on your computer, so go ahead and click it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ljh0M"&gt;Once you do that, you should now see a request on your phone that says “Allow USB debugging?” You’ll also see a long string of numbers and letters that should match up with what your PC shows if you click the gear icon on the Android Flash Tool page. On your phone, check the box next to “Always allow from this computer,” then tap Allow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jHjb7D"&gt;After that, your device should show up on the Android Flash Tool as being connected. Click on the box with the name of your device to proceed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqEnVwEk_QE3UUVA0Z1kLBWYGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014998/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your device shows up as being connected, click into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sjTlzI"&gt;You’ll want to pay attention to what appears in the “Selected build” section of the Flash Tool (see below). It should say “Android 12 Developer Preview 1.” Before you hit the blue “Install” button at the bottom of the page, I recommend tapping the pencil icon next to “Selected build” and checking the “Lock Bootloader” box. This will lock the bootloader after this process is complete, leaving you with a more secure device than if it remained unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4ejoA2xy7n9DiZCVdq1AtGd6ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014994/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Lock Bootloader” option, which will lock your bootloader after the software installation is complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="QyzbSn"&gt;The next window basically tells you to stop interacting with your phone during the rest of this process unless asked to do so and to not unplug your device. If you’re in a position to proceed, go ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRc70KHCAQGodzC1Gat0h2vS2PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015001/1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure your data is backed up before you proceed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XlJyBQ"&gt;One more prompt before getting started: a license agreement. You need to agree to the terms of the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement, which you can find &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/terms"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0FIfKs"&gt;After you hit “I accept,” your phone will reboot into its bootloader screen. If nothing happens for a few seconds, don’t worry. You may also see a window pop up on your computer that says “Reselect your device.” In that case, leave your phone alone and select “Reselect device” on the computer. According to Google, your phone might be renamed “Android,” though it might just be identified with the model name (e.g., Pixel 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zdpkzo"&gt;If you haven’t flashed software before, Google will probably need to unlock your bootloader to proceed with the installation. Keep in mind that doing this will trigger a factory reset on your phone. If you haven’t backed up your data, you’ll lose everything. Once you agree, you’ll need to allow the bootloader to unlock on your phone. To do this, use the volume keys to navigate to the option that says “Unlock the bootloader,” then hit the power button once to confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LiOV5"&gt;After that, the Android Flash Tool will begin to download and install the software. You can continue to watch along, but don’t touch your phone at this point, even though it will restart several times. Just keep an eye on the progress using the Android Flash Tool page on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAaw6d7-Vu3g4ted-MHrdzXS7bA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015017/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point, you can just sit and wait for the Android Flash Tool to wrap things up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDNXV"&gt;Once you’re all done, the phone will reboot one last time, and over on your PC, you’ll be met with a celebratory screen. You’re all done! And thankfully, you won’t have to go through this process again for the next Android 12 update — easy as this was. You’ll automatically receive updates to the developer preview over the air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WegRO7aOJMtF7tnpQvdwsPwvMN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015030/10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re all done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JwgANf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV offering HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 less in new entertainment bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NgodQrn6eVgT9Pnf24FZ3UgCD1w=/0x2:918x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838074/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_12.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCV1BW"&gt;For YouTube TV customers who subscribe individually to HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz, the company is rolling out a new entertainment bundle that will save people $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XR290i"&gt;The optional package is $30 a month. Individually, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeYoutubeTVOfferingEntertainmentBundleHBOMaxStarzShowtime02182021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; costs $15 a month, Showtime is $11 a month, and Starz is $9 a month, meaning customers who subscribe to all three spend $35 a month through the individual subscription plans. YouTube TV has steadily added more premium channels over the last couple of years, including inking a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145651/youtube-tv-hbo-streaming-max-cinemax-carriage-deal"&gt;deal with WarnerMedia for HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx2id6"&gt;While the bundle is an easy way to save $5 a month, YouTube has also gotten increasingly expensive over the last year. In June, YouTube TV increased its monthly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;price from $50 to $65&lt;/a&gt;. The move came after YouTube signed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249931/viacomcbs-youtubetv-nickelodeon-mtv-comedy-central-streaming"&gt;distribution agreement with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt; to carry a suite of channels: BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land, and VH1. While YouTube TV isn’t the only virtual TV provider to increase monthly fees as more distribution deals are struck. (AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, Fubo TV, and Hulu with Live TV have all faced similar price hikes.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRwMpa"&gt;Still, for someone who relies on YouTube TV and wants access to three of the biggest premium cable networks, it’s nice to save $5 a month. Now if only YouTube TV could figure out its regional sports network issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas freeze risks slowing COVID-19 progress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-WEATHER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIY_vkk6WoRSejZ4YGnUHmwI0cs=/5x0:2995x1993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838072/1231221664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A warming center in Houston, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Shea / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1d9K9a"&gt;Power outages and freezing temperatures continue to throttle Texas. People without heat or safe water are heading to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-help-warming-shelter/"&gt;warming centers&lt;/a&gt; or gathering in the homes of friends who have the lights on. The most pressing concern for many Texans right now is keeping warm, finding food, and making sure their water is safe to drink. But in the background is the ever-present threat of COVID-19 — which could spread in those indoor spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zn5bSY"&gt;COVID-19 cases in Texas are declining right now, like they are in most of the country, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html"&gt;thousands of cases&lt;/a&gt; are still reported each day. Hospitalization rates are still high. The ongoing pandemic means that any other disaster, like the freeze, is layering on top of a baseline emergency. “It’s broadened everything into a compound disaster, where you have more than one problem happening at the same time,” says Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WU2u55"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hate to say it, but there will likely be a swell of COVID cases in Texas as people have been forced to abandon their homes, congregate together with friends and family outside their normal bubbles, all just to stay ALIVE in the cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;— Cedric Dark, MD, MPH, FACEP (@RealCedricDark) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealCedricDark/status/1362135277276397573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs6KFE"&gt;The freeze creates similar conditions to the COVID-19 risk posed by other weather-related disasters last year: hurricanes Laura and Delta. Both &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/lake-charles-hurricane-laura-delta.html"&gt;hit Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of the Gulf Coast in a one-two punch at the end of the summer and forced thousands to leave their homes for safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3DFW2"&gt;Before those storms hit, Dahl worked on a study &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170555v1"&gt;modeling the potential impacts of a hypothetical hurricane evacuation&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 spread. That analysis predicted that type of movement &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; cause a spike in cases. It also found that social distancing and masks could limit the risk. “The same things that we’d been hearing throughout the pandemic could really help to limit that spread,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCEzFu"&gt;A clear hurricane-related surge in cases &lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/coronavirus/news/2020-10-14-hurricane-evacuations-covid-coronavirus-spike-laura-delta"&gt;never materialized&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana after the hurricanes. There could be a few reasons for that, Dahl says. First, the state offered hotel vouchers to evacuees, which let them escape the storm’s path without crowding into multifamily shelters. COVID-19 cases were also high overall at that time, which makes it more difficult for epidemiologists to figure out where cases were coming from. (High case rates made it hard for researchers to figure out the impact of other potential COVID-19 clusters, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239408/capitol-riot-covid-cases-superspreader-arrests"&gt;January riots&lt;/a&gt; at the US Capitol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00SFaC"&gt;The Texas winter storm is a different sort of weather-related disaster than a hurricane, but Dahl says the warnings from the modeling study still apply. “The study that we did was hypothetical hurricane, but it could just have easily had been a wildfire, or an extreme cold snap, or any other sort of event that causes people to start moving around,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I1vFdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Figuring out if freeze contributes to major COVID-19 spread will be a challenge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXi0Kl"&gt;Figuring out if the freezing weather contributes to major COVID-19 spread will be a challenge for the same reasons it was difficult to identify any spikes after the summer’s hurricanes. Cases are dropping around the country, but they’re still high, and it may be hard to see any kind of signal in the data. The storm also isn’t concentrated in one area, so direct impacts on case trends could be hard to see, Dahl says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yO6rp"&gt;Like in Louisiana, though, additional COVID-19 cases aren’t preordained. If people wear masks and officials organize safe places for people to gather and get warm, it won’t be as easy for the virus to spread. “The same lessons apply around the need to keep transmission low, wherever people are going,” Dahl says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oG2uZO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tplQQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oculus begins rolling out multiuser support, starting with the Quest 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wrP6XwRYDlTFsz9iCBX3lsJoY1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837741/akrales_200904_4160_0135.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgrVwV"&gt;Facebook is now rolling out multiuser support as an experimental feature for Oculus Quest 2 headsets, the company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/share-your-oculus-quest/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The primary account holder will be able to add up to three additional accounts to one device. Facebook is also rolling out app sharing as an experimental feature for the Quest 2, which will allow accounts on one device to access the apps owned by the primary account holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5V48oa"&gt;For now, the new features are exclusive to the Oculus Quest 2, but Facebook plans to bring them to all Quest users “eventually.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3XjNB"&gt;There are a few other caveats to be aware of. Facebook began requiring people to log in to their Quest headsets with their Facebook accounts last year, and that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375118/oculus-facebook-account-login-data-privacy-controversy-developers-competition"&gt;controversial rule&lt;/a&gt; still applies to everyone who signs in to one headset. Apps can only be shared by the primary account holder to other accounts logged in to a Quest device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVaiKG"&gt;And not all apps support app sharing just yet. It will work with all new apps in the Quest Store, but Facebook says “a limited number of existing games will not yet be available through App Sharing unless players purchase their own copy.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Glover’s reported Amazon deal could lead to a more curated Prime Video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3k1OlNa-0b_inDpJ0Wuo8wLdOeg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837734/donald_glover.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vWfC7S"&gt;After calling FX home for several years, &lt;em&gt;Atlanta &lt;/em&gt;creator Donald Glover is reportedly moving to Amazon with an overall deal worth eight figures, according to multiple publications. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/one-day-at-a-time-creator-signs-deal-at-amazon-1257297"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqQqY7"&gt;As part of the deal, Glover will work on a series of projects for Amazon, including the recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/13/22281597/phoebe-waller-bridge-donald-glover-amazon-mr-and-mrs-smith-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Smith &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/a&gt;, which he’ll star in alongside &lt;em&gt;Fleabag &lt;/em&gt;creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge. (Waller-Bridge also has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881938/amazon-fleabag-phoebe-waller-bridge-deal-prime-video-exclusive-emmys-streaming-wars"&gt;an overall deal with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.) One rumored project includes &lt;em&gt;Hive, &lt;/em&gt;which is centered on a “Beyoncé-like figure,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Reporter&lt;/em&gt;. Glover’s most popular show, &lt;em&gt;Atlanta&lt;/em&gt;, will continue at FX where the show is set for a third and fourth season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9ywvP"&gt;Arguably, the most interesting aspect of the deal is that Amazon will create “a content channel of sorts that will spotlight Glover’s work and other curated content on Amazon’s Prime Video hub,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Reporter&lt;/em&gt;. It’s unclear if Glover will have control over the curated works that appear on his own channel. If that’s the case, however, it could become a key creative and product feature that accomplishes two important tasks for Amazon Prime Video in particular — showcasing the impressive talent working with the company and fighting “algorithm fatigue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZfdqA"&gt;Amazon Prime Video could be one of the better streaming platforms, but its terrible product interface and browsing capabilities can make it a pain to use. It’s even more baffling that Amazon’s team hasn’t figured out a way to fix this considering the roster of talent the company has on deck. Waller-Bridge, Steve McQueen (&lt;em&gt;Small Axe&lt;/em&gt;), Jordan Peele (&lt;em&gt;Us&lt;/em&gt;), Gloria Calderón Kellett (&lt;em&gt;One Day at a Time&lt;/em&gt;), Lisa Joy and Jonathan Nolan (&lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;), Lena Waithe (&lt;em&gt;The Chi&lt;/em&gt;), and Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino (&lt;em&gt;Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt;) are just some of the most prolific creators, but their work gets lost in the mess that is Prime Video’s current setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shZii4"&gt;Adding a specific “channel” that exists on Amazon Prime Video’s homepage and highlights a creator’s work is a better form of marketing for the type of series and films Amazon has. It’s a marketing and product tactic being used by many streaming platforms in slightly different ways. HBO Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21268972/hbo-max-design-recommendation-human-curation-friends-kids-profiles"&gt;allows subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to click on an actor or director’s “playlist” and see what they’ve been watching. For example, &lt;em&gt;Lovecraft Country &lt;/em&gt;actor Jurnee Smollett’s playlist celebrating Black History Month and Black film can be seen in the screenshot below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iYjjuTv35HgZhOmgZV5e4bhJDL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312439/playlist_hbo_max.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AKOEU7"&gt;Other streaming services like Peacock and Discovery Plus have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21321482/peacock-hands-on-app-mobile-tv-channels-browse-trending-nbcuniversal-streaming"&gt;dedicated channels&lt;/a&gt; for specific series or creators. On these platforms, the idea is to replicate the feeling of live TV for people who want to throw on something like &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live &lt;/em&gt;and not touch the remote again. On HBO Max and Amazon, the strategy is creating a feeling of curation from the talent working on shows and films that are available to stream. (This is also a strategy that that Criterion Channel’s streaming service and film streaming platform MUBI mainly focus on.) If Netflix gave Martin Scorsese his own channel, for example, and handed over a list of films the company had the rights to stream, he could include &lt;em&gt;The Irishman &lt;/em&gt;and other films he truly adores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HAnQGU"&gt;As is everything with the industry right now, it all comes back to Scorsese. The director &lt;a href="https://harpers.org/archive/2021/03/il-maestro-federico-fellini-martin-scorsese/"&gt;wrote an essay in &lt;em&gt;Harper’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;about Italian director Federico Fellini and touched upon the necessity of cinema in an algorithm-defined, everything-is-content world. Algorithm fatigue isn’t new, nor is Scorsese the only one frustrated by it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcH12p"&gt;It’s a tricky thing to get right. Most subscribers likely enjoy that Netflix’s recommendation algorithm helps surface shows or movies they’ll likely be interested in. There are thousands of things to sift through otherwise. At the same time, developing creative product features that highlight an artist’s work and make it feel like a more personal connection to film or television — and less like another piece of content — is crucial to making a platform feel like a hub for great TV and film instead of just a storage space for any kind of content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDMzsj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLqMTf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sDs4lX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nyan Cat is being sold as a one-of-a-kind piece of crypto art</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-nqRj0a0UTzIDKwXzTiHwqrwd8w=/0x234:1400x1167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837725/poptart1redrainbowfix_1.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Chris Torres&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfNk2i"&gt;Nyan Cat turns 10 this year, and to mark the occasion, &lt;a href="https://foundation.app/NyanCat/nyan-cat-219"&gt;a one-of-a-kind edition&lt;/a&gt; of the iconic GIF is going up for auction. Chris Torres, the artist behind Nyan Cat, has remastered the original animation and will be selling it through the crypto art platform Foundation. The auction begins at 1PM ET today and will run for around 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaDag9"&gt;“I’m looking at [the GIF] right now, and I’m like, ‘Yes, it looks good,’” Torres said in a phone call with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I think it turned out really well this time around.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwEeKZ"&gt;Crypto art has been growing in popularity over the past few years, and there are now a number of digital marketplaces — including Zora, SuperRare, and Nifty Gateway — where collectors can buy and sell digital works. Last year, the digital artist Beeple sold a series of works for more than $3.5 million in total, and the musician Deadmau5 sold thousands of digital pins, stickers, and other collectibles in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oTROrv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You also get to directly support an artist, and I think that is really exciting for people.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYvYQH"&gt;Buyers of these works get the privilege of “owning” a piece of digital art — to the limited extent one can really own an endlessly reproducible image file. Artwork typically comes with a license that allows the buyer to display them for personal use on, say, a social media page, another digital marketplace, in a game world, or in a virtual museum. The artists generally maintain all intellectual and creative rights to the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1eR2t"&gt;That means, in some ways, buyers are really just purchasing bragging rights. “To be able to say that I’m the collector who actually owns and is a patron of this artist carries a certain kind of prestige that is really appealing to people,” Lindsay Howard, Foundation’s head of community, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You also get to directly support an artist, and I think that is really exciting for people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLaQcG"&gt;Pieces of crypto art are generally sold through “non-fungible tokens,” or NFTs, which are unique digital tokens that live on a blockchain and verify ownership of a piece. Digital artworks can be resold, and in some cases — like on Foundation — artists continue to get a cut of future sales. That means, like so much else involving the blockchain, there’s also an element of investment and speculation when purchasing crypto art since you may be able to resell a work for profit down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3YnYhf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it’s cool knowing you own the only piece in existence.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8u02D"&gt;There are some drawbacks to crypto art — particularly when it comes to energy consumption. Like bitcoin, NFTs are powered by inefficient computer processes designed to validate data. Ethereum, which most crypto art platforms rely on, is much more efficient than bitcoin, but even its creator &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/ethereum-plans-to-cut-its-absurd-energy-consumption-by-99-percent"&gt;has called the system&lt;/a&gt; “a huge waste of resources.” Ethereum is still in the process of whittling down its energy usage to a far tinier footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HMQ1s"&gt;Foundation is one of the newest entrants to the crypto art space. It launched just two weeks ago, and it’s already facilitated more than $410,000 in sales. (Though, like many crypto art platforms, sales are actually made with the cryptocurrency Ether.) “There’s an explosion that’s happening right now where artists are finally being compensated for the work that they’re creating and sharing online,” Howard said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71pjsT"&gt;Torres says crypto art offers meme creators like himself a way to directly profit off of work that has otherwise spread freely across the web. “It gives power to the creator,” Torres said. “The creator originally owns it, and then they can sell it and directly monetize and have recognition for their work.” (Torres has also built a licensing business around Nyan Cat so the character can appear in games or be made into toys.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCp1gk"&gt;To remaster Nyan Cat, which turns 10 on April 2nd, Torres went back to the original GIF to make it larger and touch up minor flaws that have bugged him over the years. One star in the original 12-frame animation would pop in out of nowhere, Torres said, so he took it out for the remastered edition. “That always bothered me,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqVza6"&gt;Once this remaster sells, Torres doesn’t plan to offer another of Nyan Cat’s original image. That means only one buyer will be able to lay claim to Nyan Cat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lPNhS"&gt;“I think it’s cool knowing you own the only piece in existence,” Torres said. “And I feel like Nyan Cat will be a really special one to own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bgmeau"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2HFvx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 developer preview is available now with many under-the-hood updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KbGHNHlVcSnalXl48QBF_HAxRKo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837707/VRG_1777_Android_12_001.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BlpL2i"&gt;Google is releasing a developer preview for the next version of Android, Android 12, for Pixel devices today. As is the norm for Google, the very first previews of Android are full of a lot of developer-facing changes. Android 12 has updates to how the OS handles images, video, and future security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEIOhd"&gt;It’s also the norm for Google to hold some of the major UI changes in reserve for its Google I/O conference, typically held in May. Although this developer preview does include some changes to the UI for notifications, until we install it we won’t know how closely it will map to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;the leak we saw earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4B47yQ"&gt;It’s available for Pixel 3 and newer phones but needs to be manually installed by flashing your device. It’s likely nowhere near ready for day-to-day use, but Google is promising that it will continue its beta program for regular users later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6DS3u"&gt;Although the point of this first preview is to give developers a jump-start on getting their apps ready for the new version of Android, there are still features that should make a tangible difference to users. Specifically, Android is going to become more adept at handling different types of media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cxqfmC"&gt;Google did not provide images of Android 12’s user interface ahead of time. We will update this post with more details and images as soon as we are able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HlNDJ2"&gt;New media formats in Android 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UWPyqw"&gt;There will be a new transcoding layer that will automatically make the HEVC video format work in apps that don’t natively support them. Currently, choosing to shoot in HEVC on an Android phone may mean that third-party apps won’t be able to natively use that video. The new transcoding layer for those apps should let users make the switch with more confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9mpAK"&gt;Android 12 will support spatial audio, support MPEG-H, and be optimized for up to 24 channels of audio (up from eight before). It will also make it easier for developers to tie rumble effects to audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="talPGl"&gt;Google appears to be throwing its weight behind the AV1 Image File Format — otherwise known as AVIF. AVIF is meant to replace JPGs as the de facto image format, offering much better and cleaner compression with fewer artifacts. &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/avif-for-next-generation-image-coding-b1d75675fe4"&gt;Netflix in particular has been a big proponent of the format&lt;/a&gt;. If AV1 sounds familiar, that’s because it’s an offshoot of the AV1 video format &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850402/apple-joins-open-media-alliance-streaming-online-video-compression-codec"&gt;that major tech companies proposed some years back&lt;/a&gt; and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126039/netflix-android-av1-video-codec-efficient-support-bandwidth-quality-vp9"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231959/google-duo-update-video-call-quality-av1-codec"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have partially adopted. AVIF also isn’t to be confused with the similar HEIF, which Apple’s cameras have been shooting for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zlfcr6"&gt;Google says that it does not intend to make AVIF the default image format for the camera app, so this is still just a first step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsIR4s"&gt;Sticking with multimedia, Android 12 will simply do a better job moving different kinds of media between apps. It’s creating a new “Rich content insertion” API that will let you cut and paste or drag and drop multiple kinds of content, including “plain and styled text to markup, images, videos, audio files, and more.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked look at Android 12. As of publication we don’t know precisely how accurate this is, but it lines up with Google’s description in its blog post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bBFYq0"&gt;Android 12 interface changes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i6MxkT"&gt;We will need to install the developer preview ourselves to get a closer look at the changes Google is introducing right now. Its blog post describes what’s new in somewhat general terms. It’s a safe bet that what Google is showing today will be a hint to larger changes due later in the year. Whether those changes really will match up with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;leaked screenshots you see above&lt;/a&gt; remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM1zFX"&gt;Here’s how Google describes the changes it is making to notifications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="1CHmDW"&gt;We’re refreshing notification designs to make them more modern, easier to use, and more functional. In this first preview you’ll notice changes from the drawer and controls to the templates themselves. We’re also optimizing transitions and animations across the system to make them more smooth. As part of the updates, for apps targeting Android 12 we’re decorating notifications with custom content with icon and expand affordances to match all other notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="doiWRV"&gt;The app icons do line up with the leaked screenshot above, though, again, that doesn’t necessarily mean that’s what the final version will look like. The “expand affordances” also line up — the downward-pointing caret you can see in the screenshot above would be easier to tap than the current system. Google also notes that it is asking developers to use an API that makes apps open up more quickly in the right spot when a user taps a notification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJhrOL"&gt;Finally, Google says that it is changing how Android 12 will behave when you’re in a full-screen app like a video, a Kindle book, or a video game. Currently, it often takes two gestures to exit out of those apps — one to bring up the UI, another to actually exit out. With Android 12, Google says that it is “changing the default to allow users to navigate their phone with one swipe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DHX9r8"&gt;Changes under the hood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gH0iMt"&gt;In 2019, Google started updating certain components deep inside the Android OS directly, rather than waiting for carriers to push through a major update. Dubbed “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18531350/google-android-q-project-mainline-security-updates-play-store-io-2019"&gt;Project Mainline&lt;/a&gt;,” it meant Google could issue security updates for critical parts of Android using the Google Play infrastructure. Ever since, it’s been adding more pieces of Android to the Mainline system. Android 12’s big addition to this system is the Android Runtime (ART), a fundamental subsystem for making Android apps run. The aforementioned media transcoder will also become a Mainline module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="671KYK"&gt;Android 12 will have a few privacy and security updates, but they won’t be as prominently visible to users. The WebView engine that third-party apps use will adopt one of Chrome’s more recent cookie settings called “SameSite,” which could help mitigate some tracking. Google says that “more privacy and security features [will be] coming in later preview releases.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TMOld"&gt;Android recently began requiring apps to pop a notification when it needs to run a background activity — which turns out to be really distracting. In Android 12, Google says it “will be blocking foreground service starts from the background,” redirecting developers to a new API. If one of these background activities can finish up in less than 10 seconds, it may not need to display a notification at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loarav"&gt;Google is also releasing an Android 12 preview for Android TV right away, including giving developers the chance to test their apps on Google’s own Google TV platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Bd3Sxd"&gt;What’s next for Android 12&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IEat3v"&gt;Google is releasing the developer preview today, but again, it requires that you flash your device’s system image, so really it’s meant for developers only right now. Google says it will work on a “Pixel 3 / 3 XL, Pixel 3a / 3a XL, Pixel 4 / 4 XL, Pixel 4a / 4a 5G, or Pixel 5 device” or developers can simply run it inside the Android emulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOvU9D"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be a public beta at some point, but expect it to take a few months. And if Google follows its past habits, there will be a more comprehensive look at what’s coming in Android 12 in May (or possibly June). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6icVS"&gt;Last year, Android’s “platform stability” release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317085/android-11-beta-2-platform-stability-apis-developer-update-google-pixel"&gt;came in early July&lt;/a&gt;, but this year Google is targeting August — the official release usually comes shortly thereafter. That could mean that Android 12 will arrive just a little later in the year than usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQyOuh"&gt;In the meantime, we and others will be digging in to the developer preview to see what other details we can find. More often than not there are enough hints scattered throughout the code to give us a good idea of Google’s final plans for Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this article about how Prop 22 may have opened the gates for the gig economy</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="US-VOTE-IT-LIFESTYLE-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d3rYzKRWgQPkRa71IGLjJKGMd8s=/0x1:4257x2839/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68837694/1229135526.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dmtynq"&gt;Last November, California passed Proposition 22, which made it so that companies like Uber and Lyft could classify their workers as contractors instead of employees, avoiding the obligation to give them benefits. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has written a great report&lt;/a&gt; about how this type of change — replacing regular employees with contractors — could be coming to many other industries across the nation, which could affect millions of workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivqJFs"&gt;While the law was pushed for by ride-share companies, the article talks about the effects already being seen in other industries, like how grocery delivery workers are being fired and replaced by on-demand DoorDash workers. It also details an op-ed by an Uber investor, talking about how Prop 22 could be used to replace employees with contract workers in various industries, from nursing to agriculture.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buos9f"&gt;Companies moving their workers to independent contract employment, instead of traditional employment, helps them keep their labor costs low. Contract employees aren’t entitled to benefits like health insurance, overtime pay, etc. The companies also don’t have to pay employees for time that they’re on the clock but not carrying out their job duties — if a grocery delivery employee is waiting for an order to come in, the company still has to pay for them to be there, which is not the case if that person works for DoorDash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AiBYfD"&gt;We’ve already seen ride-share companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;talking about taking Prop 22-like legislation nationwide&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; digs into how Uber has plenty of contacts in the Biden administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2vUMvY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tony West, Uber’s top lawyer, is Vice President Kamala Harris’ brother-in-law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FJwHOb"&gt;The article also casts some doubt on the idea that unions will be able to stem the tide. It goes into the dilemma labor leaders are facing: do they work with companies to make sure contract workers are getting an okay deal, or do they work against them and possibly lose everything?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xDNnR3"&gt;Now Uber, after successfully reshaping culture and politics to accommodate its business model, is bending unions, too. Labor groups have to take seriously the prospect that if they don’t come to the table, the companies will write the laws themselves, as they did with Prop 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="w0YVzk"&gt;While the future may be uncertain for millions of workers, it’s a good idea to stay informed on what it could look like, so that workers can be prepared if and when similar legislation starts popping up around the country. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-02-17/gig-economy-coming-for-millions-of-u-s-jobs-after-california-s-uber-lyft-vote?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
