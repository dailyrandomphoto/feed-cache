    <title>Hasbro’s new $700 Optimus Prime toy can finally transform all on its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WGZ9cBRCQEZ2-62CNRS3PaS5Jc=/64x0:577x342/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103928/Apr_09_2021_17_13_10.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgSpxM"&gt;Transformers are some of the most iconic toys around — an action figure &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a car! All in one! A true bargain! But as modern &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; toys have gotten more complex, they have also become an &lt;a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/think-transformers-toys-have-become-too-complicated-blame-michael-bay"&gt;absolutely huge pain&lt;/a&gt; to actually transform from car to robot and back again, often requiring multiple shame-filled trips back to the trashcan where you threw it in a fit of hubris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jeiqbQ"&gt;Hasbro is finally fixing that problem. Not by making the toys simpler, but by making them a lot more complicated &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; expensive in the form of its &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-advanced-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;new $700 Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Advanced Robot&lt;/a&gt;, which thanks to the power of real robotics technology (in the form of 27 servo motors and a mobile app) can actually transform all by itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMJDnP"&gt;The new Transformer is almost breathtaking in its complexity: Hasbro says that the 19-inch figure features roughly 5,000 components, 27 patented servo motors, and 60 connected microchips in order to pull off the automated transforming feature. In addition to a mobile app, the new Optimus Prime toy also features voice commands that allow owners to control the transforming action or drive around the vehicle form by shouting things like “roll out” or “convert.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06Fjsls8EqMOXsKArRIFeM1nrQs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433527/Screen_Shot_2021_04_09_at_5.15.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hasbro&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Imaa6N"&gt;The downside of owning the first Transformer that can actually, y’know, transform on its own is the eye-watering price — for $700, the new Optimus Prime toy had better be able to fight off actual Decepticons to save the Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkloSO"&gt;The new model is being built in partnership with Robosen Robotics, which, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22361383/optimus-prime-robot-toy-transformers-hasbro-robosen-robotics"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has been making suspiciously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5sPgeEEXRs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transformer&lt;/em&gt;-looking motorized robots&lt;/a&gt; for years. The  new collaboration with Hasbro, though, gives Robosen the chance to bring its skills to an official Transformer product instead of a look-alike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDqw7h"&gt;The Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Advanced Robot is available to preorder now from the Hasbro Pulse website for $699.99. Orders are expected to ship on August 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DuckDuckGo promises to block Google’s latest ad-tracking tech — if Google allows it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_2IT52stOdEcY77jm6-7hNTtu0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103512/acastro_200218_3900_StoryStream_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4vZW73"&gt;Google is &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/google-testing-its-controversial-new-ad-targeting-tech-millions-browsers-heres"&gt;just starting to test&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;replacement for third-party cookies&lt;/a&gt;, but DuckDuckGo is &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/"&gt;already announcing that it wants to block that tech&lt;/a&gt; with its Chrome extension. Google’s FLoC, or Federated Learning of Cohorts, technology is designed to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;more privacy-centered way&lt;/a&gt; to track users and serve ads to them, but some privacy advocates, like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea"&gt;claimed that it could be harmful to consumers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CJvSo"&gt;We have a great explainer on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;what FLoC is&lt;/a&gt; for those who want to go in-depth, but the overview is that the tech works to sort users into groups based on their behavior. Advertisers can then target those groups instead of individual people. Privacy advocates argue that, while it’s better than the third-party cookie situation, FLoC IDs could still be bad for consumers, containing potentially sensitive information as well as providing another data point that lets advertisers individually identify you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgN3rz"&gt;DuckDuckGo says that it agrees with those concerns &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/block-floc-with-duckduckgo/"&gt;in its blog post&lt;/a&gt; where it also announced that the latest version of its Chrome extension would prevent websites from tracking users via their FLoC identification. Of course, the company notes that the extension update will have to be approved by Google before it becomes available to its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qk7RS9"&gt;In addition to the extension update, DuckDuckGo says its search engine will opt out of collecting FLoC IDs and using them to identify or advertise to users, regardless of whether you’re using its Chrome extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irGph8"&gt;The stance isn’t surprising for a Google competitor, especially one that uses privacy as one of its main selling points. However, it does speak to the idea that FLoC will not be universally accepted — like with third-party tracking cookies before it, FLoC may be destined to become part of an arms race between advertisers and users who don’t want to be tracked. The technology isn’t even out of the testing phase yet, and other companies are already looking to block it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple refuses request to testify for Senate app store hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4ilqchlztE6YxiGVW2_jo2uWy8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103463/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="78tDaB"&gt;Senate Judiciary Committee leaders are demanding that Apple provide a witness for an upcoming hearing on app stores and digital competition after the iPhone manufacturer has refused to participate, according to a new letter to the company released Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imbRdT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/6/e/6e3e8f7c-adf3-4f0a-ae4d-429ebdee5e7b/EBBA9ECB053293C7011FBA308652C607.2021.04.09-ltr-to-tcook-apple.pdf"&gt;In the letter addressed&lt;/a&gt; to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mike Lee (R-UT) say the company “abruptly” decided not to provide a witness for an April hearing on digital markets focused on Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RT3z2o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8h7rdt"&gt;“Apple has been aware for weeks that the Subcommittee was planning a hearing on this topic and was engaged in discussions with our staff regarding who would testify on Apple’s behalf,” the senators wrote to Apple Friday. “Yet a little more than two weeks [16 days] before the planned hearing, Apple abruptly declared that it would not provide any witness to testify at a hearing in April.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhNpZ6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSug3"&gt;Apple’s App Store practices have been under intense scrutiny by lawmakers over the last year. In 2019, the House Judiciary Committee launched an investigation into competition in the tech industry, including Apple’s App Store. Throughout the probe, lawmakers homed in on the 30 percent fees Apple charges app developers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;In a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;interview last June&lt;/a&gt;, Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI) called the practice “highway robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvbzcQ"&gt;The criticism extends to the app developers themselves. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;publisher Epic Games sued Apple last year, accusing the company of violating US antitrust laws after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;removed the popular battle royale&lt;/a&gt; game from the App Store. The trial is set to begin on May 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3jmNZ"&gt;“Apple’s sudden change in course to refuse to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee on app store competition issues in April, when the company is clearly willing to discuss them in other public forums, is unacceptable,” the senators wrote. “We strongly urge Apple to reconsider its position and to provide a witness to testify before the Subcommittee in a timely manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elx5N3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More than 500 Alphabet employees demand Google stop protecting harassers in open letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Id-bScn28UEQrENSKTZFM-EueKQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103201/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y5bfqu"&gt;More than 500 Alphabet employees have signed an &lt;a href="https://stopprotectingharassers.medium.com/alphabet-stop-protecting-harassers-d32a17aa5762"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; demanding Google stop protecting the subjects of harassment complaints. The move comes two days after former Google engineer Emi Nietfeld &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html"&gt;wrote an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alleging that she was forced to have one-on-one meetings with the man who harassed her — and sit next to him in the office — even after she filed an HR complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61d6"&gt;“This is a long pattern where Alphabet protects the harasser instead of protecting the person harmed by the harassment,” the letter reads. “The person who reports harassment is forced to bear the burden, usually leaving Alphabet while their harasser stays or is rewarded for their behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kosmJq"&gt;Workers lay out two demands in the letter. First, that Google strip harassers of their direct reports, ensuring that “no harasser should manage or lead a team.” Second, that they force harassers to change teams if the claims are verified so employees don’t have to work alongside their harasser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8osStJ"&gt;“I’m heartened to see this letter,” Nietfeld said in a phone interview with&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It reminds me of how great some of my former colleagues were and why I loved working with them. Google hires so many people who are passionate about doing the right thing. It’s such a shame when the system prevents them from doing that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhIPB"&gt;Andrew Gainer-Dewar, a Google software engineer and member of the Alphabet Workers Union, says Nietfeld’s experience underlines the need for collective action. “Surely someone who has been credibly accused of harassment shouldn’t be managing people,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And someone who has been &lt;em&gt;found&lt;/em&gt; to have harassed people definitely shouldn’t be managing people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEMDgG"&gt;Nietfeld’s story highlights concerns raised by Google employees in 2018 in the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;aftermath of the Andy Rubin scandal&lt;/a&gt;. Rubin, who co-founded Android, was paid $90 million despite being credibly accused of sexual misconduct. When these allegations came to light, 20,000 Google employees walked out to protest the company’s handling of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRUDwz"&gt;One of the demands from walkout organizers was an end to the forced arbitration clause in Google contracts. While Google removed the clause for employees, it did not remove it for contractors or workers at other Alphabet companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="co0s0v"&gt;The letter directly calls out this omission. “Alphabet has not changed, and did not meet any of the Google Walkout demands (temps, vendors, contractors, and workers from Alphabet companies other than Google are still forced into arbitration),” the letter says. “We’ve already raised these issues before. The Google Walkout demands are still waiting to be met!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Gyjn"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson emphasized that the company has changed its handling of harassment claims since the walkout took place. “We’ve made significant improvements to our overall process, including the way we handle and investigate employee concerns, and introducing new care programs for employees who report concerns,” a spokesperson said. “Reporting misconduct takes courage and we’ll continue our work to improve our processes and support for the people who do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISGAc2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfJKCq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s big podcasting move is creating shows to promote TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WpownqYEXeHyOwgMrsJ06wAczEQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69103100/VRG_ILLO_4520_Apple_Podcast_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mEJw9o"&gt;The podcasting world’s been waiting and watching for Apple to debut a full-blown revenue-producing podcast business. Spotify and other tech giants have been making moves in the space — signing exclusivity deals, acquiring companies, and generally trying to dominate the market. Yet, Apple has stayed mostly quiet, despite operating one of, if not the most, popular podcast apps on the market. Recently, however, it’s started to dabble in creating its own shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbGlxd"&gt;This week, Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Foriginals%2Fthe-line%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375738%2Fapple-podcast-the-line-us-navy-spotify-original-shows" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;premiered&lt;/a&gt; a new investigative nonfiction podcast looking at US Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher, who was charged with committing war crimes. The show, called &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, serves as a complementary but separately reported program to a forthcoming Apple TV Plus show of the same name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfOM7u"&gt;Anyone hoping this might signal Apple’s broader interest in building its own podcast content was likely disappointed. Although &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt; represents a step toward Apple creating its own shows, it doesn’t dive the company head-first into the podcasting waters. Instead, the company’s dipping its toes in, relying on podcasts to promote its subscription programming rather than using podcasts as a moneymaker themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2eQLJX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple’s original podcast endeavors serve as marketing for its other revenue-making businesses&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqP0xb"&gt;Apple’s strategy continues to grow around these companion shows. Earlier this year, it premiered &lt;em&gt;For All Mankind&lt;/em&gt;, a podcast to complement its TV show of the same name, and it created a companion show for the Oprah Book Club in partnership with Apple Books. It also plans to launch a show in coordination with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;The Problem With Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, another Apple TV Plus series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;coming this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of a full-throated proclamation that Apple wants to build a business around podcasting, we’re instead seeing Apple use audio to push podcast listeners toward its moneymaking subscription service TV Plus, as well as its a la carte book-selling app Books. Basically, Apple is playing it safe and avoiding a full commitment to podcasting, which, as of right now, doesn’t make it money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKbtwx"&gt;These companion podcasts instead serve as a marketing tool to capture potential audiences in new places. Maybe some dedicated podcast listeners missed Apple’s promotional push for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;, but instead spotted the program in a show carousel on the main Apple Podcasts page. If they listen, they then might want to subscribe to TV Plus for &lt;em&gt;The Line&lt;/em&gt;’s streaming premiere, and Apple gains a $4.99-per-month subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrZOfX"&gt;This doesn’t mean Apple won’t eventually build a way to make money off podcasting. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify"&gt;been rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be getting into the podcast game more deeply and is reportedly working on a paid podcast feature. Currently, however, Apple doesn’t support any sort of revenue-producing functionality in its podcast app, like tipping, subscriptions, or exclusive content gating. For comparison, Spotify, Apple’s biggest player competitor, is testing subscription Anchor podcasts and offers a premium subscription tier. It also sells ads against its own podcasts and inserts additional ads into free users’ streams, giving the company a number of ways to profit off shows. Apple will likely never look to advertising as its main revenue driver for podcasting. The company’s taken a firm stance on user privacy, and targeting podcast ads would cross that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HeyMBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting podcast listeners to subscribe to TV Plus could give Apple a user boost&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEJDGm"&gt;It could, however, start charging for podcast content or, instead of launching a podcast in coordination with an already created TV Plus show, use its original podcasts as a launching pad for future series. If a show does well as a podcast, Apple itself could greenlight the idea into a TV production, further driving revenue. This is already a podcasting business strategy. Shows like &lt;em&gt;Serial&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; started out as successful podcasts that were then turned into video programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFakrn"&gt;Other video streaming companies have pulled from a similar podcasting playbook. &lt;a href="https://www.hbo.com/podcasts"&gt;HBO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netflixeditorial.com/channels/netflix-podcasts/"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; both create companion content for their shows, which not only encourages viewers to spend more time with the company’s programming, but also reaches a different audience, one that might be enticed to subscribe just because of what they heard on a podcast. The difference between those companies and Apple is their lack of podcasting infrastructure. They don’t have a player themselves, so there’s less opportunity to build a business around original shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rExaAP"&gt;Apple has multiple one-ups on these other streaming services. It already owns the space where a large portion of people listen to podcasts, and it offers a variety of content subscriptions for games, TV shows, fitness, and more, including a bundle. Building the technology to support paid podcasts is one of the last steps to structure the business — it’s that and believing podcasting could actually become a real revenue driver all on its own.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkBtky"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to the ’80s classic &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; starring Tom Cruise, will now premiere on November 19th, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/top-gun-maverick-mission-impossible-7-tom-cruise-release-date-change-july-4th-weekend-memorial-day-weekend-1234730581/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It was previously slated to open on July 2nd — which itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336869/a-quiet-place-part-2-top-gun-maverick-delayed-coronavirus-covid-19-2021"&gt;was a delay&lt;/a&gt; from December 23rd, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmsJVs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maverick’s&lt;/em&gt; delay is the latest shift in this summer’s movie slate, which, like last summer’s, has been impacted significantly by the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;Disney delayed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;from a May release date to July 9th and is also opting to make it available as a $30 Disney Plus Premier Access title the same day. The company also made Pixar’s &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt; a Disney Plus exclusive and said &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; will be a Disney Plus Premier Access release when it hits theaters on May 28th. MGM delayed &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, the next James Bond movie, from April 2nd &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/no-time-to-die-release-date-delay-james-bond-1234883484/"&gt;to October 8th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krTaTE"&gt;Universal Pictures also shifted the highly anticipated &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/f9-release-date-postponed-summer-1234883492/"&gt;Memorial Day weekend to June 25th&lt;/a&gt;, which would make it the first major blockbuster to exclusively release in theaters since Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; last fall — assuming Universal doesn’t follow its competition and delay the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious&lt;/em&gt; film again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqzNC9"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Top Gun&lt;/em&gt; sequel’s delay has cascading effects on the rest of Paramount Pictures’ movie lineup. Two other movies starring Cruise have been bumped: &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7&lt;/em&gt; is now debuting on May 27th, 2022, instead of this November, while &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 8&lt;/em&gt; has moved from a November 2022 release to July 7th, 2023, according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Dungeons and Dragons&lt;/em&gt; has also been delayed, moving to a March 3rd, 2023, debut. Paramount’s announcement also referenced an as-yet unrevealed &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; film — which &lt;a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-next-star-trek-movie-has-a-stardate-in-2023-1846652498"&gt;&lt;em&gt;io9&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is a secret, J.J. Abrams-produced project — set to hit theaters on June 9th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA seeks to put first person of color on the Moon in Artemis mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YRn0roG1HDeVBsbiT3wyCswKK1g=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102884/GSFC_20171208_Archive_e001861_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Acting NASA administrator Steve Jurczyk said Friday that under President Biden’s budget request, the agency’s Artemis mission has a new goal: in addition to landing the first woman on the Moon, it will also send the first person of color to the lunar surface. So far, the only Earthlings to touch the Moon’s surface have been white men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfgyZF"&gt;“The president’s discretionary request increases NASA’s ability to better understand Earth and further monitor and predict the impacts of climate change,” &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/acting-nasa-administrator-statement-on-agency-fy-2022-discretionary-request"&gt;Jurczyk said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “It also gives us the necessary resources to continue advancing America’s bipartisan Moon to Mars space exploration plan, including landing the first woman and first person of color on the Moon under the Artemis program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8nuxGH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BC5khqpKovU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RgXVWL"&gt;Biden’s 2022 budget request includes $24.7 billion for NASA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z51NCU"&gt;NASA previously announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18622415/nasa-moon-return-first-woman-astronaut-artemis-program"&gt;Artemis mission&lt;/a&gt;, named for the Greek Moon goddess and twin sister of the god Apollo, would put a woman on the Moon’s surface by 2024. Last November, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;introduced the 18 astronauts&lt;/a&gt; who will staff the Artemis mission. The group includes several people of color and nine women. It’s not yet known who the first woman or person of color on the Moon will be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T0Seg"&gt;The Space Launch System — the giant rocket the space agency plans to use to send people to the Moon — has its first uncrewed flight scheduled for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The White House wants to spend $100 million to monitor the air we breathe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="615463_ME-SMOKE-AIR-QUALITY-BRV_BRV" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIUOWXagvLptksCz7pkTNgTZFfw=/48x0:3552x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102763/1228565206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bTNNe3"&gt;Today, the White House proposed spending $100 million on a new program aimed at tracking air quality in some of the most polluted communities in the US. It was a tiny piece of President Joe Biden’s initial $1.5 trillion federal budget request for 2022, but it is representative of the new administration’s&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;efforts to address legacies of environmental wreckage and injustice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNv8gV"&gt;The air quality program would be funded through the Environmental Protection Agency, whose budget Biden seeks to raise by more than 21 percent. There aren’t many details yet on what the program might look like. But on top of tracking air quality, it would be able to notify people with “real-time data” in places with some of the worst pollution in the nation. The program would “hold polluters accountable,” &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/FY2022-Discretionary-Request.pdf"&gt;according to the budget request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwNztp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The $100 million could go toward tackling some problematic gaps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAI17E"&gt;The $100 million could go toward tackling some problematic gaps in how air quality is measured today. Those gaps can leave some communities, particularly &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4626327/"&gt;low-income&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods and &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/13/6001?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=89531294&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9xNvMHn1bWk9yKfonfI3tKRFqpBykQxjDPLwQQ8jOWV6x-lOYIn8RzUEdKwvI0RkzvF9opoWwdz4RPe8VAmXGxrue0heNyHVsPkDmeLZHAAcWSn38&amp;amp;utm_content=89531294&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;people of color&lt;/a&gt;, more vulnerable to pollution than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBFhBI"&gt;High-quality air quality monitors that researchers and regulators use have typically been too&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;expensive to deploy widely. Because they can be spread thin in some regions, they can miss differences in pollution levels from neighborhood to neighborhood. From one block to another, pollution can actually grow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303326/data-air-pollution-mapped-google-street-view-aclima"&gt;as much as eight times thicker&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4iHYO"&gt;Even where there are government air quality monitors, communities have been let down. These devices have failed spectacularly in the past, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21833693/air-quality-index-monitoring-epa-pollution-health-reuters"&gt;investigation by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; revealed last year. When a refinery exploded in Philadelphia in 2019, the federal air quality index reported clean air in the city that day even though 700,000 pounds of hazardous chemicals had been released. That’s because the closest official air monitor was programmed to take measurements just one out of every six days, and it happened to miss the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gb6zrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More affordable commercial air quality monitors have hit the market&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74o9UZ"&gt;Luckily, more affordable commercial air quality monitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21440343/air-quality-sensors-wildfire-smoke-pollution-climate-change"&gt;have hit the market&lt;/a&gt; lately. That’s allowed a growing network of everyday people to track air quality from their homes. While these devices are not quite as sensitive as official monitors, they’ve begun to fill in the gaps when it comes to mapping pollution in the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEsKdA"&gt;That’s come in particularly handy as more intense fire seasons have choked the air across much of the western US. For the first time last year, the EPA and US Forest Service included data from popular at-home air quality sensors in their &lt;a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=40.764548399999995&amp;amp;lng=-73.9227458&amp;amp;zoom=10"&gt;fire and smoke map&lt;/a&gt;. The description of Biden’s proposed initiative as a “community” air quality monitoring and notification system, suggests that it might add to those efforts to merge citizen science with government data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDN612"&gt;Today’s $1.5 trillion proposal from the White House includes funding requests for discretionary spending, which makes up about a third of the total federal budget. The Biden administration plans to announce a fuller budget proposal later this spring for the 2022 fiscal year that starts in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV29vx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OneWeb, SpaceX satellites dodged a potential collision in orbit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fairy lights in the night sky" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1z1cf5YTaS6mZ7CpV1qpfQ3mXI=/0x443:7118x5188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102707/1210396023.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k79daZ"&gt;Two satellites from the fast-growing constellations of OneWeb and SpaceX’s Starlink dodged a dangerously close approach with one another in orbit last weekend, representatives from the US Space Force and OneWeb said. It’s the first known collision avoidance event for the two rival companies as they race to expand their new broadband-beaming networks in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSDCsS"&gt;On March 30th, five days after OneWeb launched its latest batch of 36 satellites from Russia, the company received several “red alerts” from the US Space Force’s 18th Space Control Squadron warning of a possible collision with a Starlink satellite. Because OneWeb’s constellation operates in higher orbits around Earth, the company’s satellites must pass through SpaceX’s mesh of Starlink satellites, which orbit at an altitude of roughly 550 km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wJKCr"&gt;One Space Force alert indicated a collision probability of 1.3 percent, with the two satellites coming as close as 190 feet — a dangerously close proximity for satellites in orbit. If satellites collide in orbit, it could cause a cascading disaster that could generate hundreds of pieces of debris and send them on crash courses with other satellites nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhejKL"&gt;Currently, there’s no national or global authority that would force satellite operators to take action on predicted collisions. Space Force’s urgent alerts sent OneWeb engineers scrambling to email SpaceX’s Starlink team to coordinate maneuvers that would put the two satellites at safer distances from one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0bYq35"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Coordination is the issue. It is not sufficient to say ‘I’ve got an automated system.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdtND5"&gt;While coordinating with OneWeb, SpaceX disabled its automated AI-powered collision avoidance system to allow OneWeb to steer its satellite out of the way, according to OneWeb’s government affairs chief Chris McLaughlin. It was unclear why exactly SpaceX disabled the system. SpaceX, which rarely responds to reporters, did not return multiple requests for comment for this story, nor did David Goldman, the company’s director of satellite policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4qv8y"&gt;SpaceX’s automated system for avoiding satellite collisions has sparked controversy, raising concerns from other satellite operators who say they have no way of knowing which way the system will move a Starlink satellite in the event of a close approach. “Coordination is the issue,” McLaughlin says. “It is not sufficient to say ‘I’ve got an automated system,’ because the other guy may not have, and won’t understand what yours is trying to do.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LSxBricZOFk2t78xAO0QYUgohik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22432826/Satellites.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: OneWeb / SpaceX&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneWeb satellites (left) launch in batches of 36. SpaceX’s Starlink satellites (right) launch in batches of 60.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UlziMS"&gt;SpaceX has roughly 1,370 Starlink satellites in orbit and is on track to launch thousands more, with ambitions to build a 12,000-satellite network of global broadband coverage. OneWeb has launched 146 satellites so far, of the roughly 650 it plans to send into orbit for a similar global network, operating in higher orbits around Earth. And Jeff Bezos’ Amazon has pledged to join the same race, planning to launch over 3,000 satellites in low-Earth orbit. All companies want to beam broadband internet into Earth’s most rural regions to meet increasing demand from consumers and governments alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1XhpM8"&gt;“This event was a good example of how satellite operators can be responsible given the constraints of global best practices,” says Diana McKissock, the head of the Space Force 18th Space Control Squadron’s data sharing and spaceflight safety wing. “They shared their data with each other, they got in contact with each other, and I think in absence of any global regulation, that’s... the art of the possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="d2K8Ip"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What is the point of having it if you have to turn it off when there’s going to be a potential collision?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pODbDc"&gt;Still, the sharp increase of satellites in orbit, mainly driven by SpaceX’s Starlink venture, has moved faster than any authority can regulate the industry for safety. McKissock says SpaceX has made efforts to increase its transparency in orbit; the company currently provides location data of its satellites to other operators. But its automated system for avoiding collisions is a closed book where openness and coordination are needed the most, analysts and operators say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjtb86"&gt;“What is the point of having it if you have to turn it off when there’s going to be a potential collision?” Victoria Samson of the Secure World Foundation says, adding that the void of any clear international framework for managing active objects in space makes it largely unclear who would be held responsible if a collision actually occurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51lVkr"&gt;Satellite maneuvers in space are common, but worry in the industry is mounting as OneWeb, SpaceX, Amazon, and other companies race to toss more satellites into space. And this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847243/spacex-starlink-satellite-european-space-agency-aeolus-conjunction-space-debris"&gt;Starlink close call isn’t the first&lt;/a&gt;. In 2019, a European Space Agency satellite had to move out of the way of a Starlink satellite to avoid a potential collision. SpaceX didn’t move its satellite because of a computer bug that prevented proper communication with ESA, it said at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zuhyrp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just crossing your fingers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQntcq"&gt;With more OneWeb satellite launches planned on a monthly basis, and with planned constellations from Amazon and Telesat in higher orbits than Starlink, the need to establish clear rules of the road in orbit is becoming more urgent than ever. SpaceX looms especially large, not just because of the size of its constellation but because of where it’s sending them. “OneWeb and others will have to transit through Starlink to reach their destinations, so SpaceX needs to ensure now that other satellite operators can do that safely,” says Caleb Henry, a satellite industry analyst at Quilty Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSBWQa"&gt;McKissock says the 18th Space Control Squadron is fully aware of the industry concerns with SpaceX’s autonomous avoidance approach. “So it’s been interesting,” she says. “But like I said, I’m glad they talked to each other. The scary situation is when one of the operators is not communicative, and then it’s just crossing your fingers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y4wFHy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, April 9, 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A source originally identified the company that maneuvered their satellite out of the way as SpaceX. After publication, they clarified that the satellite that made the maneuver belonged to OneWeb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned Disney is making a retractable lightsaber, and I need to see it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TKQtz3Gh0zLK3m_JM3zuyB96_k=/146x0:1145x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69102431/StudyingSkywalkersEpIV_luke_obi_wan_lightsaber.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7Ldz72"&gt;To whom it may concern at The Walt Disney Company and / or Lucasfilm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCZyph"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Show me the damn lightsaber&lt;/em&gt;. I know you have a real one now. And it’s time to fess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncBEnC"&gt;Let’s backtrack a bit. Yesterday, at a seemingly routine press event for the upcoming launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374457/avengers-campus-opening-disneyland-june-4th"&gt;Disneyland’s new Avengers Campus&lt;/a&gt; area on June 4th, Josh D’Amaro, the chairman of Disney parks, ended his presentation with a surprise reveal of a new lightsaber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="URqnFx"&gt;According to tweets from theme park reporter Carlye Wisel, who attended the press conference, the lightsaber was not the typical IRL lightsaber of “a giant light up stick attached to a neat-looking hilt.” In fact, it was the holy grail of replica sabers: one that can fully extend and retract its blade, just like the “real” lightsabers in the films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I just attended a virtual press conference and Josh D'Amaro had a lightsaber and it worked like a LIGHTSABER not a "im carrying around this long stick" lightsaber like a FUCKING LIGHTSABER LIGHTSABER&lt;/p&gt;— carlye wisel   hosts Very Amusing!  ✨  (@carlyewisel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlyewisel/status/1380267046164783105?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VU0NBC"&gt;There’s plenty of evidence that a better toy saber has been on Disney’s mind for a while. The company’s current crop of replica props and customized Galaxy’s Edge sabers are already hugely popular, to start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAFYT0"&gt;The company is clearly aware of the fact that the large plastic blades are a cumbersome annoyance — both Disney and plenty of third-party sellers &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.shopdisney.com/lightsaber-sheath-star-wars-galaxys-edge-400021042131.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer carrying bags&lt;/a&gt;. And a truly retractable saber that lights up and looks good (and no, those lame plastic ones of stacked tubes don’t count) would be a huge upgrade for park fans and cosplayers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQVxQu"&gt;More illuminating is a &lt;a href="https://wdwnt.com/2018/11/disney-files-patent-for-retractable-internally-illuminated-lightsaber/"&gt;patent that Disney filed in 2018&lt;/a&gt; for a “Sword Device with Retractable, Internally Illuminated Blade” — a lightsaber hilt with a motorized retractable blade that can extend out of the hilt, complete with lighting and sound effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UV1B5f"&gt;To be clear, given that Disney’s new model almost certainly lacks the ability to coalesce a beam of pure energy that can slice through any object, it’s still not a real lightsaber. Plus, I’m not sure where Disney would be able to source kyber crystals. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xC6J4T_hUKg"&gt;Hacksmith Industries’ retractable 4,000-degree plasma blade&lt;/a&gt; is still the closest to achieving that, but that build required a massive power pack and is almost certainly not safe to sell as a children’s toy at a theme park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ghym2a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xC6J4T_hUKg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyOhr1"&gt;But to return to my original point: after teasing this fantastic upgraded saber... &lt;em&gt;DISNEY DIDN’T RELEASE THE VIDEO. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbAodk"&gt;There are probably a few reasons for this. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carlyewisel/status/1380272525645553668"&gt;Wisel’s report notes&lt;/a&gt; that the new saber “*zhooped*” out of a “little box (like a hilt but much wider),” suggesting that the retractable saber is still in the design stage and that there’s probably some work that needs to be done before it’s ready for primetime. Disney may also be planning to save the new sabers for its upcoming immersive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyworld.disney.go.com%2Fdestinations%2Fstar-wars-galactic-starcruiser%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375720%2Fdisney-parks-lightsaber-retractable-blade-rumor-patent" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser&lt;/a&gt; hotel, where the more realistic sabers would fit right in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjAtDP"&gt;But I don’t really care about all those very logical business reasons. I just want to see the cool new lightsaber. Ball’s in your court, Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
