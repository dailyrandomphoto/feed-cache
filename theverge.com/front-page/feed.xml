    <title>V-Moda M-200 ANC review: $500 headphones can’t be this unpolished</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;V-Moda’s first noise-canceling headphones are built well and have balanced sound, but they fall short on features&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="tmz4ke"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max just might have ushered in a new norm of $500-plus wireless headphones. My argument in support of this? V-Moda’s new M-200 ANC headphones, which sell for $499.99 and, as the name makes obvious, are the company’s first headphones to include active noise cancellation. V-Moda is a company that’s well-known in the DJ world, and prior headphones like the original M100s and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16152736/v-moda-crossfade-2-wireless-review-bluetooth-headphones"&gt;Crossfade 2 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; have earned it some fans in the audiophile crowd. With the M-200 ANCs, V-Moda is trying to compete in a higher price bracket than ever before — but the results are a little uneven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8MQcE"&gt;If there’s one thing that V-Moda has never wavered on, it’s durability. Like past models, the M-200 ANC headphones feel phenomenally strong and reassuring no matter how harshly you handle them. These things are built like tanks. My old pair of M100s must be at least seven or eight years old at this point, but the folding joints and other core hardware have never given out — even long after the headband material has started to wear and show its age. I still use ‘em as a gaming headset with V-Moda’s add-on boom mic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4BBYA"&gt;I think it’s fair to question whether this is the same V-Moda that it used to be; before the company was sold to Roland, I’d regularly sit down with founder Val Kolton, who seemed to hold the brand to an obsessive level of quality assurance. But so far, I don’t see any reason to question the robustness of these new headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="30GST9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10401766"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOZWJb"&gt;The M-200 ANCs stick with the usual V-Moda aesthetic: it’s mostly a mix of metal and artificial leather. They also still fold down into the company’s signature carrying case. However, the size of the shield plates on each ear cup has changed. So if you’ve got old, customized plates, those will no longer fit. The ear pads (filled with memory foam) now attach magnetically and feel nice and cushiony. It used to be that you had to buy V-Moda’s aftermarket “XL” earpads for the best extended comfort, but not so this time around. I’m also glad they’re so easy to replace. Magnets!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHEC7s"&gt;There are buttons at the top of the right ear cup for play / pause and volume controls, and this is where the M-200 ANCs start to betray their asking price. The buttons are mushy, which I can understand since that means they don’t click loudly as you’re listening to music. It can still feel a bit cheap. Aside from this, their location so far at the top can make them awkward to reach when you’re actually wearing the headphones. Maybe it’s just my enormous head, but I struggled at times. The buttons at the bottom for power and noise cancellation are much simpler to reach (and for some reason, they’re clickier, too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RcIzC-5iPndF4LqNsmL6bBagE_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382875/VModaControls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The music control buttons can be a little cumbersome.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ub-DTGbGJ4rk094lzkKk9a_IPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382877/VModaUSBC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda has made the switch to USB-C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5FNiPv"&gt;Out of the box with EQ settings left untouched, the M-200 ANCs have an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; neutral sound profile. I don’t know that I’d call them reference studio monitors, but they’re very flat. This can make for a jarring change if you’re switching over from other headphones like the AirPods Max or Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless cans, which try to show you everything they’re sonically worth right off the bat without any adjustments. In this case, you’ll want to immediately explore the EQ presets (V-Moda’s app lets you take full manual control) to find something that sounds the best to you. Even if you crank the low-frequency sliders, the M-200 ANCs won’t rattle your brain. But you can get them to a point where EDM and hip-hop don’t underwhelm, which they can if you stick with the default, balanced EQ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Urqfdu"&gt;When you do take the time to nail the EQ, the M-200 ANCs sound very good. V-Moda downsized to 40-millimeter drivers (from 50mm in the original M-200), but these headphones do a terrific job of preserving the mids through all sorts of EQ adjustments. “$500 noise-canceling headphones with neutral sound” strikes me as an odd zone to be playing in, but V-Moda can certainly paint itself as a standout here. They support aptX HD, aptX, AAC, and SBC Bluetooth codecs, so they’re well-rounded for wireless audio. I also tested them wired with my Apple Lossless files and streaming Amazon Music HD, and the M-200 ANCs proved wonderfully layered and rich. (They don’t seem to pass audio over USB-C, unfortunately, so that port is just for charging.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjZhDl"&gt;I’ve noticed that V-Moda’s app can be buggy; sometimes it’ll display a spinning loading indicator that never goes anywhere. The M-200 ANCs have also given me “iPhone can no longer connect to this device” errors, which required me to pair the headphones all over again. Roland needs to put more work into its software. Most frustrating of all is that the M-200 ANCs can only store two paired devices in memory. If you add a third, the first one will be overwritten. Want to switch between a phone, tablet, and PC without much fuss? Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JG7gXpHrgDOg_1mBdU2eCtR4dpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382881/VModaDriver.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M-200 ANC ear pads attach to the headphones magnetically. Underneath them are these 40mm drivers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iUCtvS"&gt;These headphones don’t have a dedicated transparency mode that you can toggle on for hearing outside noise. But V-Moda did &lt;em&gt;blatantly&lt;/em&gt; steal a trick from Sony: you can hold a hand on the left ear cup, the music will drop in volume, and ambient noise will be piped in using the built-in microphones. Once you remove your hand, your music volume and ANC return to normal. That’s a useful feature for quick interactions or listening to an announcement at an airport or on a train, but at $500, I would’ve liked to see some way of keeping transparency mode enabled for as long as desired — no arm-lifting required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mr67QDQv916p4MA9hIG4lpT3u2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382896/VModaCase.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;V-Moda might have the best carrying case around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BaKLBkcSKVPDPuDNmXq9aRZ3e6E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382898/VModaEars.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M-200 ANCs don’t uncomfortably clamp down on your head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tGg8ML"&gt;The M-200 ANCs lack sensors for detecting when they’ve been removed from your ears, so they won’t pause audio automatically like other premium noise-canceling headphones. Again, for $500, those extra convenience tricks should be part of the experience. Another would be multipoint Bluetooth pairing, which these headphones don’t give you either. Battery life is rated at 20 hours, which is on par with Bose and Apple but short of Sony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="LWOrQp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10401801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uurxca"&gt;V-Moda is new to noise cancellation, and it shows. The M-200 ANCs can’t rise to the level of the AirPods Max or even lower-priced options like Sony’s 1000XM4s or the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700. They’ll cut out a lot of lower-frequency noise, but the overall effect isn’t quite on the level of competitors. The V-Moda app lets you choose between 10 levels of noise cancellation, but even fully dialed up, I never quite felt like I was in that personal bubble of silence that the best ANC headphones provide. On the positive side, V-Moda’s noise cancellation didn’t result in any discomfort, nor did it noticeably alter the sound, which can happen with some headphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YyjjhPIB8mhqZSkBHlh4-Z95F3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22382887/VModaMax.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who will be next to join the $500 noise-canceling headphones squad?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HYww7p"&gt;Along with the headphones and case, V-Moda includes a 3.5-millimeter cable, USB-C charging cable, and an airplane adapter. I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wish the company had bundled its BoomPro microphone — sold separately for $35 — right in the box with the M-200 ANCs. It feels like a missed opportunity, as the BoomPro is truly a great accessory for gaming and Zoom calls. Keep in mind that Apple didn’t even include a headphone cable with the AirPods Max, so I can’t knock V-Moda too hard, but this would’ve been a prime moment to give customers that bonus. It also would’ve helped boost the M-200 ANCs at voice call performance. As is, the built-in microphones are nothing special, and callers might find it difficult to hear you in loud or windy environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NIqCZK"&gt;I genuinely wonder if V-Moda would have priced these things at $500 in a world without the AirPods Max. With Apple’s cans set aside, you’d be looking at an upper echelon of Bluetooth headphones with options like the Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins PX7 and Sennheiser Momentum 3 that tops out around $400. (No, I haven’t forgotten about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409031/bang-olufsen-beoplay-h95-noise-canceling-headphones-announced"&gt;those $800 Beoplay H95s&lt;/a&gt;, but come on.) The M-200 ANCs are a solid pair of wireless headphones, and they maintain V-Moda’s fantastic build quality. But it’s impossible to overlook what’s missing when a company is asking for this much cash. The balanced sound signature will be a definite win for people who are explicitly looking for that. But these really needed to have a true transparency mode and better ANC to keep up with the pack and to warrant the significant investment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro looks even better than a real one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKfzK4MEgHc9NL_E6dxEaIyDTDA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68996280/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_1.50.09_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="48SGu8"&gt;Intel launched a new ad campaign starring Justin Long, Apple’s “I’m a Mac” actor, but for this campaign, Long is singing the praises of PC laptops and comparing them to MacBooks. The thing is, for reasons that we can’t quite figure out, Intel actually made the MacBook Pros in its commercials look &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than they do in real life, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/my4ZjCUkTsI"&gt;tech YouTuber Rene Ritchie&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHxUsS"&gt;Take a look at these two photos. The one on the left is a photo of a MacBook Pro with an M1 chip taken for &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; review. The one on the right is taken from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;this Intel ad&lt;/a&gt;. Can you spot the difference? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gCbYEy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10402291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQAO3Z"&gt;I’ll spoil it for you: Intel’s version of the MacBook Pro has &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; thinner screen bezels, making it a nearly edge-to-edge display. I’d love it if my MacBook’s bezels were this thin! (Though Intel’s version of a MacBook Pro doesn’t have a webcam. Bummer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfrVaf"&gt;But Intel’s fabled all-screen MacBook Pro didn’t make just one appearance. It’s also &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;in this ad&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to ding the MacBook Pro for not being a 2-in-1. Look at that Mac — all screen! &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Umm86hxxxDCxyXPZek-082_221Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383686/Screen_Shot_2021_03_19_at_10.08.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="deOxPX"&gt;Intel did confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it used real MacBook Pros with an M1 chip in the commercials, but the company wouldn’t initially say what it may or may not have changed about them: “With respect to filming and showcasing details, we’re not commenting at this time,” an Intel spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NmIWF"&gt;However, Intel’s Ryan Shrout confirmed a likely theory on Saturday: Intel changed the look of the MacBook Pros’ screens in post-production, which had the happenstance effect of making their screens look better than they do in real life. It was a rush job, apparently, and they made a mistake when compositing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZhPwq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Also, the composite on the Macs made the bezels look smaller than they should be, another mistake in composite due to time. We recorded using the current shipping M1-based machines.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Shrout (@ryanshrout) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryanshrout/status/1373339942533926917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0FVO2"&gt;(If you look at the image from the second ad, you can also see some kind of blackish-haze applied over the screen, which probably wouldn’t be there in reality.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Q96gD"&gt;These ads, in my opinion, are also kind of missing the point. None of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvDDC6ktCUg"&gt;Intel’s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gtRRMd2_UI"&gt;four&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfHplU5fatE"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HebkohrCns"&gt;commercials&lt;/a&gt; demonstrate how Intel’s chips can compete with the MacBook Pro’s real advantage: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;Apple’s speedy and battery-efficient M1 chip&lt;/a&gt;. (So far, Intel has only produced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272041/intel-apple-macbook-m1-performance-benchmarks-processors"&gt;cherry-picked benchmarks&lt;/a&gt; to try and hit back at the M1.) And by trying to dunk on the MacBook Pro, Intel is also, in a way, dunking on itself, since it still provides chips for some models of the Apple laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1k50q1"&gt;And seriously, doesn’t that all-screen MacBook Pro just look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnauH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 20th, 9PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Intel’s confirmation that it was a compositing error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IsIoq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Shrout tweeted on Saturday, not Sunday, because it is not Sunday yet. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22340964/twitter-accounts-bots-days-of-the-week-what-day-is-it"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I blame Daniel Craig.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fp51go"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This tiny car beat Tesla’s Model 3 as the best-selling EV in the world for January and February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W_KTQ0pWWLh8V3MwV_N24ez5K3k=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999986/1024px_Wuling_Hongguang_Mini_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jengtingchen" target="_blank"&gt;Jengtingchen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xp09Gq"&gt;The Hong Guang Mini EV edged out Tesla’s Model 3 as the &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/491293/global-plugin-car-sales-january-2021/"&gt;top-selling electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; in the world in January &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/495187/china-plugin-car-sales-february-2021/"&gt;and February&lt;/a&gt;, not a small feat for the relatively new hatchback. More than 36,000 of the tiny cars sold in January, compared to about 21,500 Model 3s, and the Hong Guang sold just over 20,000 units last month, compared to just under 13,700 Tesla 3s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDU1Py"&gt;The diminutive vehicle is made under a joint partnership between China’s state-owned SAIC Motor, Wuling Motors, and US carmaker General Motors, and is locally referred to simply as Wuling. The Hong Guang Mini EV sells in China only for 28,800 yuan, or about $4,500. It claims to get 170 kilometers (roughly 106 miles) per charge, and can reach a top speed of 100 kilometers per hour or 62 miles per hour (so no drag racing in this thing). &lt;a href="https://www.topgear.com.ph/news/car-news/2020-wuling-hong-guang-mini-ev-specs-prices-features-a962-20201026"&gt;Its specs include&lt;/a&gt; a wheelbase of 76.4 inches, and it is just under 115 inches long, 59 inches wide, and stands about 64 inches tall. Its total weight is about 1,466 pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hVQML"&gt;In other words, it’s tall but skinny. Still, the manufacturer claims it can seat four people, and the rear seats fold down if you need storage space. For something very small, presumably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1H1Eg"&gt;The 2021 base model of Tesla’s Model 3 EV on the other hand, gets more than 250 miles per charge, and its sticker price starts at just under $40,000. It has a wheelbase of 113 inches, is 185 inches long, 73 inches wide and about 57 inches tall. The base Model 3 weighs around 3,500 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODWpUG"&gt;The Hong Guang Mini EV launched last summer and was a &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/442357/wuling-15000-hong-guang-mini-ev-august/"&gt;surprise success&lt;/a&gt;, but is still only sold in China. Some &lt;a href="https://www.thedrive.com/news/36218/this-adorable-four-seater-electric-hatchback-is-selling-like-crazy-in-china"&gt;reports suggest&lt;/a&gt; that it may come to other markets eventually, but the US is likely low on the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8FUP3"&gt;It is cute, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In8tu3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brazil regulator fines Apple $2 million for not including chargers with iPhone 12</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RLt8N"&gt;The consumer protection agency in Brazil’s São Paulo state has fined Apple $2 million for failing to include chargers within iPhone 12 boxes, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/20/brazil-agency-fines-apple-iphone-12-charger/"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; 9to5 Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Procon-SP says Apple engaged in “misleading advertising, selling a device without the charger and unfair terms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhGqAY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514480/apple-iphone-charging-brick-charger-earbuds-box-environmental-impact-carbon-emissions"&gt;Apple announced in October&lt;/a&gt; that the iPhone 12 and would not come with chargers or earbuds in their boxes, citing environmental concerns. By only including a USB-C to Lightning cable with iPhone 12 and other new models, Apple said it would be able to reduce the raw materials for each iPhone it sells, in addition to reducing the size of the phones’ boxes. Critics suggested the change had more to do with allowing Apple to reduce shipping costs, and environmental experts said the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;impact on the environment would likely be minimal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5YEJv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/procon-na-midia/"&gt;Procon&lt;/a&gt; said it asked Apple whether the company would reduce the iPhone 12’s price since there were no chargers included, and did not receive a response. The agency also accused the company of failing to help customers who had “problems with some functions” on their iPhones following updates. A spokesman for the agency said Apple “needs to respect these laws and these institutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL1kTN"&gt;The fine does not seem like it would be particularly troubling for Apple, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;$111.4 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in the first quarter of 2021 (that total includes 2020 holiday sales of iPhone 12 models). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mw50E"&gt;Apple did not immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase pays $6.5 million to settle trading investigation with CFTC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j2Prig"&gt;The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8369-21"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt; Friday that cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase has paid $6.5 million to settle regulators’ claims that it reported misleading transaction data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2DNgW"&gt;According to the CFTC, between January 2015 and September 2018 “Coinbase recklessly delivered false, misleading, or inaccurate reports concerning transactions in digital assets.” The agency alleges that two trading programs operated  by Coinbase generated orders that traded with each other, which could have misled traders about the trading volume on the exchange now called Coinbase Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WDjHg"&gt;The CFTC also fined Coinbase for what are known as “&lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CFTCGlossary/index.htm#washsales"&gt;wash trades&lt;/a&gt;” in the Litecoin cryptocurrency and bitcoin that were conducted by a former Coinbase employee on Coinbase’s GDAX platform. Wash trades are banned because they create a false appearance of trading volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGsix7"&gt;A Coinbase spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;  that it did not admit or deny the CFTC’s charges, and had “proactively engaged with the CFTC” over the course of its investigation. The staement notes that the settlement order “does not include any finding of harm to any Coinbase customer.” The company says it “firmly believe[s] that Coinbase has always aimed to create a reliable and secure trading environment for the benefit of our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9pLd4X"&gt;Last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300835/coinbase-s1-bitcoin-going-public-profit-revenue-invest-crypto"&gt;Coinbase publicly filed&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to list its stock on the NASDAQ exchange. According to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_1197"&gt;S-1 prospectus&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase had 43 million verified users at the end of 2020, with a total of $90 billion of assets held in trust. Since its founding in 2012 as a platform for bitcoin trading, Coinbase has handled some $456 billion of transactions. Last year, it had revenue of $1.2 billion, turning a profit of $322 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinuing two configurations of its 21.5 inch iMac</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DUWgd5-YJjYedvU_sL9yJ_k_sj8=/48x0:2808x1840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999258/Screen_Shot_2020_08_04_at_11.10.17_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The 21.5 and 27 inch iMacs | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fGSntk"&gt;Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/6/22316831/apple-store-imac-pro-base-model-while-supplies-last"&gt;discontinued the iMac Pro,&lt;/a&gt; and two configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are now joining the Pro in retirement. As spotted &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/20/512gb-1tb-ssd-imac-21-discontinued/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 512GB and 1TB SSD configurations of the 21.5-inch iMac are no longer available for purchase, with only the 256GB SSD and 1TB Fusion drive versions available to buy on Apple’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlNXBM"&gt;Both configurations appeared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/21-5-inch-imac-ssd-upgrades-unavailable/"&gt;unavailable for purchase&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s website as of last month, but at the time it was not clear if that was a supply issue or a permanent discontinuation of the two options. But now both the 512GB and 1TB SSD options are gone from the iMac configuration page, &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugEhbO"&gt;A big iMac redesign has been rumored in the works for some time. Apple is expected to replace the 27-inch and 21.5-inch versions of the iMac with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233191/apple-silicon-redesigned-imac-mac-pro-rumor-features"&gt;redesigned iMac&lt;/a&gt; and will likely revamp the Mac Pro sometime this year. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-plans-redesigned-imac-new-mac-pro-smaller-mac-pro-cheaper-monitor?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the update would have a flat-back design and do away with the “chin” beneath the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuOIe5"&gt;The new iMacs are expected to use Apple silicon chips, as the company continues to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21295475/apple-mac-processors-arm-silicon-chips-wwdc-2020"&gt;shift away from Intel chips&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Victor Santos’ new comic Paranoia Killer is a dark thriller with an unassuming cartoon look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bRgZ_PLietEMCBiPlUtZ33-JOXw=/0x77:740x570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999190/paranoiakiller_01_big.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fhhc71"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comics have never been bigger: with Marvel TV shows, DC movies, and indie adaptations growing by the day, comic books have never been more prominent in pop culture. This ongoing &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; column recommends comic series new and old, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqUOWq"&gt;Sometimes the art and narrative of a comic go hand-in-hand. A horror story might be full of lots of black and reds, while a superhero comic is brighter and cleaner. &lt;a href="http://panelsyndicate.com/comics/paranoia-killer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; goes in a different direction. The series is a dark thriller, full of violence and serious subject matter, but with a visual style reminiscent of a Nickelodeon cartoon. Somehow, it still works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTRYT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is a brand-new series — so far, only the first of four parts is available — that centers on Nathalie Laertes, an FBI agent forced to take on a very strange undercover job: impersonating her twin brother. It turns out that her twin, who she believed to be just a slightly troubled sibling, was actually one of the world’s most infamous hitmen. Surprise!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="str0oW"&gt;Nathalie learns all of this when her brother turns up dead, and her boss forces her to impersonate him in order to infiltrate a criminal organization. Part of it is that they’re identical twins, so she has the look down. But they also apparently share some kind of “aura” that makes the whole switch possible. The first issue ends just as things really start heating up, as she heads off to a criminal training facility in the middle of the desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IBo3fSpwi5wgU_trlTnAaRBNNjg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22383128/Paranoia06Pre.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0mxERs"&gt;The thriller setup has a lot of potential, and I’m hooked after just the first issue. But part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; so interesting is its contrast in styles. The story is R-rated material; you’ll see characters shot dead in cold blood, and it opens with what appears to be a torture sequence. But it’s coupled with a surprisingly lighthearted art style, with flat colors and lots of clear, simple shapes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPlBo"&gt;In the first issue’s afterword, creator Victor Santos says this contrast of styles was born partly out of stubbornness. “I went for a more exaggerated cartoon style in this book, I suppose because I’m very stubborn, and I keep reading from time-to-time some critics saying that you can’t do ‘serious things’ with that style,” he writes. Well, so far, he’s made his point; in issue one, the art doesn’t distract but instead gives &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; a very distinct vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOFFEY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is it by?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is the brainchild of Victor Santos, a Spanish comics creator who handled every part of the project: story, art, and design. He’s probably best-known for the series &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_(webcomic)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also happens to be about a hitman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cb6fyH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I read it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paranoia Killer&lt;/em&gt; is the latest release on Panel Syndicate, a creator-run digital platform for comics. So far, it’s featured excellent series like &lt;em&gt;The Private Eye&lt;/em&gt; — a story about a future without the internet from Brian K. Vaughan, Marcos Martin, and Muntsa Vicente — and even a &lt;em&gt;Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; spinoff. It’s a great place to find some offbeat stories, like the incredible &lt;em&gt;Umami&lt;/em&gt; from Ken Niimura, which might not have a place at more traditional publishers. It also operates under a pay-what-you-want system, letting you support creators however you feel comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter will set up a legal entity in Turkey to comply with controversial social media law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KrrNL2xxcJVYi490kG9fGe53XU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68999103/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ZpXXc"&gt;Twitter is planning to establish a legal entity in Turkey to continue operating there under the country’s controversial &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/world/europe/turkey-social-media-control.html"&gt;internet law that took effect last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/update-twitter-turkey.html"&gt;announced late Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Under the law, social media companies that have more than 1 million users must store Turkish users’ data in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmHs8P"&gt;Such companies also are required to designate an official representative in Turkey, who must answer requests to take down content that violates privacy within 48 hours. If the companies refuse to comply, they could face fines, advertising bans, and eventually bandwidth reductions that could make the platforms unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPWf0M"&gt;“We remain committed to protecting the voices and data of people in Turkey who use Twitter. We will continue to be transparent about how we handle requests from government and law enforcement,” Twitter said in its statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpxUQg"&gt;Authorities in Turkey fined Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok 40 million liras (about $5.1 million) each in 2020 for failing to appoint the required local representative. Facebook, TikTok, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/turkey-media-social-media-6f2b1567e0e7f02e983a98f9dc795265"&gt;have since established&lt;/a&gt; the required legal entities in the country. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-twitter/turkey-slaps-ad-ban-on-twitter-under-new-social-media-law-idUSKBN29O0CT"&gt;Twitter was among the social media companies&lt;/a&gt; that received a ban on advertising in Turkey under the new law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOySxg"&gt;The Turkish government says Internet Law 5651, as the legislation is called, is necessary to protect the rights of social media users in the country and to fight online criminal activity. But human rights organizations caution the law is censorship that risks access to information, in a country that the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/twitter-to-establish-legal-entity-in-turkey-comply-with-law/2021/03/20/fe4f501e-8959-11eb-be4a-24b89f616f2c_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; has a history of restricting free speech. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to the age of vaccine diplomacy  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EL SALVADOR-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8eV4pTTkqJ_6-vvKgqimOLmKQU=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68998744/1231655388.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Workers unload the first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine provided by COVAX in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, on March 11, 2021. | Photo by MARVIN RECINOS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1xbLy"&gt;Millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines currently sitting in United States warehouses are now destined for vaccination sites in Mexico and Canada, according to the White House. The donation marks one of the US’ first steps into the dawning — and deeply contentious — world of late-stage pandemic vaccine diplomacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IcDZq7"&gt;The neighborly gesture is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/world/americas/usa-mexico-vaccine-coronavirus.html"&gt;reportedly a loan&lt;/a&gt; — the US expects that they will return the favor and hand over some vaccine doses in the future. The US can certainly afford to be generous with these doses. The AstraZeneca vaccine that it’s donating hasn’t been authorized in the US. The country reserved doses &lt;em&gt;just in case&lt;/em&gt; it is eventually given the green light by the FDA, but the vaccine is still being tested in the US. Results from that trial &lt;a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04516746"&gt;are expected soon&lt;/a&gt;, but functionally, the US has a whole bunch of doses sitting around that it can’t do anything with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="h3nPPJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xVkyp"&gt;But other countries can. Many places have given AstraZeneca the all-clear, including Canada and Mexico. And the US has lined up enough authorized vaccines to innoculate the entire US populations. That’s left many people pushing the Biden administration to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-vaccine.html"&gt;let the doses go&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html"&gt;countries that need them&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it seems, they are finally going to do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uTPd3"&gt;(Quick aside: Complicating everything, there’s a whole mess with the AstraZeneca vaccine rollout in Europe — some weird blood clotting showed up in a few patients, causing several countries to halt vaccinations. Vaccinations resumed this week, with several regulators — and AstraZeneca — insisting that the vaccine is safe.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FRE1zC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;functionally, the US has a whole bunch of doses sitting around that it can’t do anything with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7IpwA"&gt;The few million doses being handed to Mexico and Canada are a start. But on the global stage, the US is a bit late to the party when it comes to vaccine donation. China, India, and Russia, among others, have all been pushing this particular version of soft power for a while now. India, which has a massive pharmaceutical manufacturing industry, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/us/politics/coronavirus-astrazeneca-united-states.html"&gt;is in a prime position to donate vaccines to other countries&lt;/a&gt;. The UAE is jockeying to become a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3123969/uae-chinas-vaccine-diplomacy-stepping-stone-its-own-geopolitical"&gt;major vaccine hub&lt;/a&gt; in the Middle East, both buying and distributing vaccines. China and Russia have both developed their own vaccines and are using them to &lt;a href="https://healthpolicy-watch.news/russia-and-chinas-bilateral-vaccine/"&gt;bolster alliances around the world&lt;/a&gt;. So now you’ve got multiple countries pushing their own vaccine supplies (and their own national agendas) to countries who can’t afford to negotiate their own deals with a limited number of manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRCizJ"&gt;Then there’s COVAX. COVAX is a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-55795297"&gt;vaccine distribution effort&lt;/a&gt; put together by international organizations including the World Health Organization. Its goal is to make sure that poorer countries &lt;a href="https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/fair-allocation-mechanism-for-covid-19-vaccines-through-the-covax-facility"&gt;also have access&lt;/a&gt; to COVID-19 vaccines. So far, it’s shipped &lt;a href="https://www.gavi.org/covax-vaccine-roll-out"&gt;about 30 million vaccines&lt;/a&gt; around the world. That’s not nothing, but a small fraction of the more than 420 million vaccine doses &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/"&gt;administered worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. And it’s well short of COVAX’s goal of administering more than one billion doses to poorer countries by the end of this year.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr5pVe"&gt;This has left COVAX &lt;em&gt;very annoyed&lt;/em&gt; at all the bilateral wheeling-dealing happening between countries, and between countries and drug companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxNDEO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pushing wealthy countries like the US to put their doses where their wallets are&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KA67JP"&gt;“We have made great progress,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-who-covax/vaccine-hoarding-threatens-global-supply-via-covax-who-idUSKBN2AQ2O5"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt;. “But that progress is fragile. We need to accelerate the supply and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and we cannot do that if some countries continue to approach manufacturers who are producing vaccines that COVAX is counting on. These actions undermine COVAX and deprive health workers and vulnerable people around the world of life-saving vaccines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2i68f"&gt;Biden has pledged &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/us-covax-initative-4-billion-donate-doses-83903faa-a6b9-44e7-b44b-90e6f28c42ee.html"&gt;$4 billion to COVAX&lt;/a&gt;, but international pressure is increasingly building for wealthy countries like the US to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/covax-why-biden-s-billions-won-t-fix-covid-vaccine-n1258816"&gt;put their doses where their wallets are&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiaDbq"&gt;“From a U.S. perspective, we’re losing a bit of the messaging war out there,” Krishna Udayakumar, director of Duke University’s Global Health Innovation Center &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/extra-vaccine-doses-america-a7b5c9ee-7ab2-4cce-b220-54899f824ba9.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. “If we look six months from now, it may well be the fact that the U.S. has donated more doses than any other country in the world. But right now the storyline is how we’re buying more and hoarding more of the supply.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="X594p4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When this is all over... the nations of the world will be left with how they treated other human beings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wfBLwj"&gt;The US appears to be trying to change that storyline — but it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/12/us-and-pacific-partners-to-flood-asia-with-vaccines-475571"&gt;taking its own diplomatic path to get there&lt;/a&gt;. In March, President Biden met with leaders of Australia, Japan, and India on a plan to boost production of vaccines, and flood countries in Asia and the Pacific with vaccines this year.  At the same time, there’s internal pressure for the US government to quickly roll out the vaccines they have to their own population, which, due to the Trump administration’s own bungling of the pandemic has &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html"&gt;suffered the highest official death toll of any country in the world&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORi9oM"&gt;As the rollout continues, this is all going to keep happening. Countries will try to vaccinate the people in their borders, and they’ll simultaneously try to make the most of any donations to the rest of the world. For now, it’s a messy political problem that’s getting tied into other international negotiations. But when this is all over and the vaccine vials are empty, the nations of the world will be left with how they treated other human beings — whether they held on to a security blanket of extra doses, or whether they handed over some of their bounty to a neighbor in need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAUDE7"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="w7NJFN"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xh82x8"&gt;Destiny has led me into a mysterious place these last nine months: isolation. At a time in my life when I am supposed to be branching out, the COVID pandemic seems to have trimmed those branches back to nubs. I have had to research colleges without setting foot on them. I’ve introduced myself to strangers through essays, videos, and test scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>TikTok banning some accounts in Myanmar in attempt to stop the spread of violent videos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8iVo2g"&gt;TikTok says it has “aggressively banned” numerous accounts and devices in Myanmar, in an attempt to curb misinformation and the spread of violent videos on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLr9zD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/tiktok-is-repeating-facebooks-mistakes-in-myanmar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that government soldiers in Myanmar have posted hundreds of videos to TikTok since its military seized power in February. The videos ranges from traditional pro-government propaganda, to misinformation meant to confuse protesters, to threats from soldiers with weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euwgNg"&gt;TikTok removed some of the videos earlier this month after &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-tiktok/i-will-shoot-whoever-i-see-myanmar-soldiers-use-tiktok-to-threaten-protesters-idUSKBN2AW17X"&gt;media reports&lt;/a&gt; about the rise in hate speech and threats in the southeast Asian nation. But &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reports that the short-form video platform admitted it had not moved swiftly enough to stop the spread of the threatening videos and other violent content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rNbJK"&gt;As demonstrators continue to protest the February 1st coup, more than 200 people have been &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-politics-idUSKBN2BC026"&gt;killed in Myanmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjwK7x"&gt;“The promotion of hate, violence and misinformation has absolutely no place on TikTok,” a company spokesperson said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When we identified the rapidly escalating situation in Myanmar, we quickly expanded our dedicated resources and further stepped up efforts to remove violative content. We aggressively banned numerous accounts and devices that we identified promoting dangerous content at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsQj5i"&gt;The spokesperson added that TikTok “will continue to make significant investment to respond to new threats in order to keep TikTok in Myanmar a safe platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AW31VG"&gt;Activists and rights advocates told &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; that the use of TikTok to spread government propaganda in Myanmar bore similarities to the way the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html"&gt;country’s military used Facebook&lt;/a&gt; to stoke violence and hate speech against the country’s Rohingya minority in the early 2010s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGxwgx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/an-update-on-myanmar/"&gt;In February, Facebook said&lt;/a&gt; it was banning the Tatmadaw—Myanmar’s military— and other state-controlled entities from both Facebook and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XFfXaZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
