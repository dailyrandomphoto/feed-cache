    <title>Hyundai recalls Kona EVs over battery fire risk</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZJ4IG"&gt;Hyundai is finally recalling some 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020 after more than a dozen reported fires related to the electric SUV’s battery pack. It’s the second recall of the Kona EV, but the first global recall, and it will cost Hyundai around $900 million to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlTSWh"&gt;Hyundai is also recalling some Ioniq EVs and electric buses built between November 2017 and March 2020 that use the same LG Chem cells. In total, the automaker is recalling 82,000 vehicles. Hyundai and LG Chem have decided to completely replace the batteries in these vehicles instead of trying to solve the issue through software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMAhX7"&gt;The recall is starting in South Korea, but Hyundai Motor North America told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it will “be taking a similar action in the US and Canada.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMsezD"&gt;“We are working closely with NHTSA and Transport Canada on the recall and will communicate the details to affected customers shortly,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2waPu"&gt;Reports of Kona EVs catching fire date back as far as mid-2019, and at least 15 have been documented since, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/now-a-recalled-kona-ev-has-caught-fire-and-hyundai-is-1846134031"&gt;including one vehicle that was already called in for repair&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1ligg"&gt;The issue &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/489753/chevy-bolt-cells-different-separators-kona/"&gt;allegedly has to do with the material that separates the cell’s cathode and anode&lt;/a&gt;, though an official investigation in South Korea is still ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eWb8C"&gt;General Motors recently recalled nearly 70,000 Chevy Bolts that use LG Chem batteries after reports of fires, though the automaker &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/489753/chevy-bolt-cells-different-separators-kona/"&gt;clarified to &lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it uses a different cell than the one in the Kona EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUC1aG"&gt;News of the recall comes just one day after Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;unveiled the Ioniq 5 crossover SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which will be the first EV built on the company’s new electric vehicle platform. That platform &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/23/hyundai-taps-catl-and-sk-innovation-to-supply-more-batteries-for-e-gmp/"&gt;will use battery cells from fellow Korean company SK Innovation as well as China’s CATL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update February 24th, 2021 11:48AM ET: Both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059832%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x/consoles/products/xbox-series-x/B224744Y.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059832%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x/consoles/products/xbox-series-s-digital-edition/B224746K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are currently available at GameStop starting at $299.99. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out, and if you missed out on preordering either (or both — look, I’m not going to judge), you might be able to snag one online soon. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ikctbP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744Y.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-s-digital-edition%2FB224746K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles have been available to purchase since last fall, but actually finding one to buy has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking to buy either console, GameStop has both models in stock, and they are available for preorder while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Regardless of which console you buy, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P06Nfx"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpa4v9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOq3lx"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="A07hUv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"},{"title":"Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21538464/ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-games-list-new-release-holiday-2020-2021"},{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s next big patch delayed to second half of March after studio hack</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6BgMK6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; next big patch has been delayed following developer CD Projekt Red’s disclosure that it fell victim to a ransomware attack earlier this month. The next big patch, 1.2, is now scheduled for a release sometime in the second half of March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUZgzo"&gt;“While we dearly wanted to deliver Patch 1.2 for Cyberpunk 2077 in the timespan we detailed previously, the recent cyber attack on the studio’s IT infrastructure and extensive scope of the update mean this unfortunately will not happen — we’ll need some additional time,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607741680115717"&gt;CD Projekt Red said&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kQR2Yc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our goal for Patch 1.2 goes beyond any of our previous updates. We’ve been working on numerous overall quality improvements and fixes, and we still have work to do to make sure that’s what you get. With that in mind, we’re now aiming for release in the second half of March. 2/3&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607743399755780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUgv92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; launched in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;extremely buggy state&lt;/a&gt;, which led Sony to take the drastic step of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;removing the game from the PlayStation Store&lt;/a&gt;. CD Projekt Red has released numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268382/cyberpunk-2077-1-12-new-hotfix-patch-mods-vulnerability-security"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; since launch in an attempt to address issues, and it sounds as if patch 1.2 could be the most significant yet. “Our goal for Patch 1.2 goes beyond any of our previous updates,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1364607743399755780"&gt;CD Projekt Red said&lt;/a&gt;. The studio is also &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;working on&lt;/a&gt; free DLCs and a free next-gen console update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The NYPD deploys a robot dog again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7hfxwrfAXZuYuzRwkieP29RKKEA=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867715/robot_dog.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UkC5Mu"&gt;The cyberpunk dystopia is here! (If you weren’t aware: I’m sorry. You’re living in a cyberpunk dystopia.) The latest sign — aside from corporations controlling many aspects of everyday life, massive widespread wealth inequality, and the recent prominence of bisexual lighting — comes in the form of robot dogs deployed to do jobs human police used to. Yesterday, as &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/23/video-shows-nypds-new-robotic-dog-in-action-in-the-bronx"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the NYPD deployed Boston Dynamics’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697540/boston-dynamics-robots-commercial-real-world-business-spot-on-sale"&gt;robot “dog” Spot&lt;/a&gt; to a home invasion crime scene in the Bronx. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MSKqy6"&gt;&lt;iframe height="348" width="618" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="//players.brightcove.net/4137224153001/6aIMRO3kiI_default/index.html?videoId=6234666514001"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWmZbr"&gt;The video was taken by videographer Daniel Valls, of FreedomNews.tv. You can hear a voice say “that thing is creepy” as the robot prances past the camera. The &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; reports that a spokesperson for the NYPD said the robot is in a test phase, presumably to see if it’s actually useful out in the field. (It was equipped with lights and cameras, the spokesperson continued, to ensure that NYPD could see whatever the robot was seeing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX6jVD"&gt;This isn’t the first time the NYPD has deployed one of Boston Dynamics’ robots. Back in October, the department used another Spot to &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2020/10/29/nypd-deploys-robot-dog-after-brooklyn-parking-dispute-shooting/"&gt;find a gunman who’d barricaded himself in a building&lt;/a&gt; after he’d accidentally shot someone in the head during a parking dispute in Brooklyn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jAnpv7"&gt;While I think it’s probably a good thing that robots are being used more often in situations that might be dangerous for a human, it is more than a little unnerving to see the things that happen in books begin to happen in real life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reservation Of The Anticovid Vaccine For Over Eighty In Apulian Pharmacies" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4leCSmB_jTd6jhw7V_SvQQsfQ8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299704/1231117569.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydTwid"&gt;Joby Aviation, the electric aviation company based in Northern California, is the latest futuristic mobility company to go public via a reverse merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. To celebrate, the company is releasing the first footage of its electric aircraft in flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bs2kqd"&gt;Joby, which is backed by Toyota and recently acquired Uber’s flying taxi division, is merging with Reinvent Technology Partners, a “blank check” company run by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Zynga founder Mark Pincus. The new company, which will have a post-money valuation of $6.6 billion, will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dYdDT"&gt;As part of the deal, Joby will get $1.6 billion in cash, $690 million of which will come from Reinvent’s cash in trust and $835 million from private investors The Baupost Group, funds and accounts managed by BlackRock, Fidelity Management &amp;amp; Research LLC, and Baillie Gifford. Hoffman will join Joby’s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MtOKH7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As part of the deal, Joby will get $1.6 billion in cash&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UteFAA"&gt;Joby is the brainchild of inventor JoeBen Bevirt, who started the company in 2009 and operated it in relative obscurity. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/1/16959698/joby-aviation-evtol-100-million-investment"&gt;Joby announced&lt;/a&gt; it had raised a surprising $100 million from a variety of investors, including the venture capital arms of Intel, Toyota, and JetBlue. The money helped finance the development of the company’s air taxi prototype, which has been conducting test flights at Joby’s private airfield in Northern California. Bevirt helps run an incubator outside of Santa Cruz that’s been described as a &lt;a href="https://pando.com/2013/07/03/the-startup-ranch-of-santa-cruz/"&gt;quasi-commune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9nuYr"&gt;The company closed on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21068135/joby-aviation-toyota-flying-air-taxi-investment-amount"&gt;massive $590 million round of venture capital funding&lt;/a&gt;. Joby also announced that it was teaming up with previous investor Toyota to launch an air taxi service using its new aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDzeEe"&gt;Unlike the dozens of other companies that are currently building electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, Joby has kept much of its project under wraps. Today’s footage is the first time Joby’s vehicle has been seen in flight. The all-electric aircraft has six rotors and seats five, including the pilot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9vx9z"&gt;The video shows it taking off vertically, like a helicopter, and then shifting into forward flight using tilt rotors. Joby says it can reach a top speed of 200 mph, travel 150 miles on a single charge, and is 100 times quieter than a conventional aircraft. The company says it aims to have a scaled-up air taxi service in operation by 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFrwdA"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KViIZufQAZ7Q8T7vh79VIuHVW-nZp3CN/view"&gt;the company’s investor presentation&lt;/a&gt;, Joby expects each aircraft to cost $1.3 million to manufacture, with the potential to reduce that amount by half in the future. Joby also projects that each aircraft will generate $2.2 million in revenue. That assumes every aircraft will operate 4,500 hours per year with an average of 2.3 passengers per trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v89ELH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Joby expects each aircraft to cost $1.3 million to manufacture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iiDkzq"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michetravi/status/1364586943053455363"&gt;As noted by aviation writer Michael Travierso on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, this represents an exponential increase over the number of hours the average Cessna aircraft at a busy aeroclub flies every year. Electric aircraft are expected to require less maintenance than their gas-powered equivalents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evaJTe"&gt;Of course, many companies — Joby included — have promised revolutionary new aircraft for years, only to miss deadlines or fail to live up to past promises. Kitty Hawk, the flying car venture backed by Google co-founder Larry Page, had to reorganize &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/12/01/inside-larry-pages-kitty-hawk-returned-deposits-battery-fires-boeing-cora/#c6e934858ab4"&gt;amid reports&lt;/a&gt; about breakdowns, battery fires, and returned deposits. Another startup, Zunum, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612702/zunum-aero-sues-boeing-fraud-hybrid-electric-jet"&gt;locked in a bitter legal fight&lt;/a&gt; with its former investor, Boeing. And last year, Germany’s Lilium Jet had a &lt;a href="https://evtol.com/news/lilium-evtol-catches-fire/"&gt;prototype catch fire recently&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gsiyh7"&gt;Joby isn’t the only eVTOL company to go public via SPAC. Archer Aviation, another electric flight company, plans on &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/42feff1d-8228-4c93-bd78-b537d9eb9fa7"&gt;merging with blank-check company&lt;/a&gt; Atlas Crest Investment Corp, and it has said it would &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/23/archer-aviation-aims-to-launch-network-of-urban-air-taxis-in-los-angeles-by-2024/"&gt;launch an air taxi service in Los Angeles by 2024&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim is Steam’s hottest new PC game, and it’s now sold 4 million copies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday February 19th, two days after we originally published this post, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;it hit 3 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. We're now at &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/892970/announcements/detail/3058478454611894476"&gt;4 million&lt;/a&gt; as of February 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlvYZS"&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at many occasions, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably trading blows with Dota 2 and PUBG for the #2 and #3 slots each day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="an0GTw"&gt;By Friday the 19th, it took the #9 spot with 410,000 players, pulling &lt;em&gt;Postal &lt;/em&gt;down one rung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pANFTq"&gt;By the 21st, it crossed 500,000 simultaneous players to claim the #5 slot, bumping four more games down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WvlxVY"&gt;Developer Iron Gate says it's already been played for a total of 10,000 years. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJXT0NhkWQgCA4_iJaYyaP3x5AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309223/steam_top_sellers_lunar_new_year.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot taken February 15th, the last day of the Steam sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jvXfF31K_kYujVsQz_1WN9Ow060=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309294/valheim_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3l7Vk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 19th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim has now sold 3 million copies and is now has a new record for the ninth-most simultaneous players at any one moment on Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vR2id"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 24th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim has now sold 4 million copies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kiyo Pro doesn’t deliver all the goods a $200 webcam should</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This lens-shaped webcam has some tricks up its sleeve, but at a high cost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hnEwN4"&gt;Razer has released a swath of products so far during the pandemic, but its new Kiyo Pro might have the widest appeal of them all. It’s a new $199 webcam that looks like a lens ripped off a mirrorless camera, aimed to give Logitech’s Brio some good competition in the specs department. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/7/14531452/logitech-brio-4k-pro-webcam"&gt;four-year-old Brio&lt;/a&gt; is still the ideal choice if you value 4K capture and Windows Hello authentication, but the Kiyo Pro is no slouch, capable of streaming or recording 1080p footage at up to 60 frames per second, with an optional HDR mode that displays at 30 frames per second. Razer’s new webcam is a more compact alternative, and it has a few other features that might make it worth considering if you want a high-end webcam for more than just joining Zoom calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j37Vsy"&gt;The Kiyo Pro is being positioned as a good choice both for jumping into a meeting and for people who have hobbies or careers broadcasting their faces. It’s backing up that claim with a few features that I’ve been able to test over the past few days. One of them is its adjustable field of view (FOV), letting you swap between 80 degrees for a tighter crop of your face, a midrange 90-degree shot, or up to a super-wide 103 degrees. The latter option is nice if more than one person is in the shot or if you want to show off your living space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xh8I4C"&gt;You can adjust these settings and more from within Razer’s Synapse, though annoyingly, that software didn’t always reflect changes I made to the settings in the camera preview. Strangely, I had to join a Zoom call to see changes take effect. I understand there are people who don’t want to fuss with software, and so you know, this is a plug-and-play device for Windows 10 and macOS. That said, it’ll be at a fixed FOV, and the suite of settings that I detail below won’t be available to you unless you get Razer’s software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IoKnK4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10355570"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3XFFf"&gt;This webcam features a 2.1-megapixel CMOS IMX327 autofocusing sensor with an f/2.0 aperture, covered in a sheet of Gorilla Glass 3, which is admittedly an odd feature for a camera that doesn’t move. It utilizes Sony’s Starvis technology, typically used in security cams, that makes it good at picking out details in low light and balancing light sources for a true-to-life picture. I was impressed with its ability to automatically make the dreadful lighting in my basement studio apartment look alright, with a few small tweaks by me in the brightness and saturation departments). So, I imagine people with ideal lighting will fare even better and possibly not have to adjust settings at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PoiAjt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Noticeably smoother and more detailed than any laptop webcam&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aiFIRQ"&gt;During some Zoom calls with the Kiyo Pro, none of the participants were blown away by the visual fidelity. They did, however, remark that it’s noticeably smoother and more detailed in terms of color accuracy than any laptop webcam, and especially given my apartment’s lighting situation (almost all artificial lights, with little natural light coming in), my picture looked lively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xBmDYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10359311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYIDfk"&gt;Even with a bright window behind me that usually gets over-exposed by just about any laptop’s webcam, this camera balanced my apartment’s lighting without blowing out the background or dropping off in terms of detail. If you’re a game streamer with a vibrant set of colorful LEDs set up around your rig, this feature should be beneficial to you, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afQNKp"&gt;The autofocus works relatively quickly, and it didn’t have to spend long clearing up the shot when I held an object close to the sensor, then pulled it away so it could refocus on my face. However, the autofocus tends to jump around a lot, hunting for a clearer shot even if I’m barely moving. This was perhaps the most annoying part of the experience for me, but it’s a small consolation that Synapse lets you set it to manual focus if you don’t plan to move all that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpJWJp"&gt;This webcam features omnidirectional microphones, though I highly recommend using a dedicated microphone or a headset equipped with one instead. What’s built into the Kiyo Pro is good in a pinch, and there’s a good amount of bass and clarity in my voice, but it’s a little quiet and echo-y by default. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8bca6H4ql71R6eQMT4B48MpnuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22319959/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resist the urge to twist the Kiyo Pro like a traditional camera lens. It’s unfortunately just for show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oYxWKH"&gt;Razer’s Kiyo Pro is a competent webcam with a few unique traits. At $200, it obviously can’t compete with the fidelity of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;DSLR or mirrorless camera that’s been repurposed as a webcam&lt;/a&gt; or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;a modern smartphone with webcam apps installed&lt;/a&gt;. But for the cost, it should stack up better than it does to Logitech’s Brio released in 2017. Instead, Razer made an equally pricey webcam with fewer features. If webcams ever become as tough to find in stock as they were in early 2020, it’ll be nice to have another option on the market. But presently, it’s tough to recommend this model outright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson’s single-shot vaccine is effective, FDA confirms</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Zaqwv"&gt;The one-dose COVID-19 vaccine made by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson protects against severe disease and has no serious safety concerns, according to a new analysis &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146217/download"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; by the US Food and Drug Administration. The report takes the vaccine one step closer to authorization by the agency, meaning the United States could have a third shot available in a matter of days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aLvTo8"&gt;The FDA has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;spent the last three weeks&lt;/a&gt; reviewing data submitted by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson. The company ran its clinical trial in the United States, South Africa, and Latin America. The vaccine was over 80 percent effective at preventing severe cases of COVID-19 in both South Africa and the United States. No one who was 28 days out from their dose of the vaccine was hospitalized with or died from COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Jl1vk"&gt;In the United States, the FDA found that the vaccine was 72 percent effective at preventing both severe and milder cases of the disease 28 days after the shot. That dropped to 64 percent in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;is circulating&lt;/a&gt;. COVID-19 vaccines don’t work as well against that variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tAdU8G"&gt;Even though that drop is worrying, the FDA’s analysis of the South Africa data is actually more encouraging than the initial results released by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson at the end of January. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;At that point&lt;/a&gt;, the vaccine appeared to be only 58 percent effective in the South Africa trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96E2M7"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Janssen/J&amp;amp;J vaccine data now posted. Consistent with other COVID vaccines, divergence in rates around 14 days and lower hospitalization rates.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/8HXOZDQSHZ"&gt;https://t.co/8HXOZDQSHZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5pDDByWFz8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5pDDByWFz8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Bennett (@nbennett04) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbennett04/status/1364564588528734216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="taML6S"&gt;New data released by Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/146219/download"&gt;hinted&lt;/a&gt; that the vaccine could also protect people from asymptomatic infections (cases where people have the virus but never develop any symptoms). The company tested nearly 1,000 people in the clinical trial 71 days after they received a shot to check if they had antibodies against the coronavirus. If they had antibodies, that was a sign that they’d been infected with the virus (even if they never felt sick). Only two people who received the vaccine had antibodies, compared to 16 people who received a placebo shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAXlKM"&gt;It’s a promising sign, even though the data is extremely limited. “Definitive conclusions cannot be drawn at this time,” the FDA wrote in its briefing document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PC4NtT"&gt;It’s difficult to compare the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to those made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna. Although those two vaccines appeared to be more effective against all cases of COVID-19 where people reported symptoms (around 95 percent), they were tested before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;coronavirus variants&lt;/a&gt; were circulating widely. And even if it’s slightly less effective against mild and moderate disease, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot only takes one dose and can be stored in refrigerators. The logistical benefits may counteract a slight drop in efficacy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1ramu"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson is asking the FDA to authorize its vaccine for people 18 years of age and older. An independent advisory committee to the agency will meet on February 26th to review the data. The committee will decide if it thinks the FDA should authorize the vaccine, and if all goes well, that authorization could come as early as February 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
