    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FP6wnJ"&gt;Early Christmas morning, NASA’s revolutionary new space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, successfully launched into space after taking off on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket from South America. The launch marks the beginning of one of the most anticipated NASA missions in decades, a program that promises to transform how we study the deepest depths of the Universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khSZcV"&gt;“From a tropical rainforest to the edge of time itself, James Webb begins a voyage back to the birth of the Universe,” Rob Navias, NASA’s announcer on the agency’s livestream, said at liftoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oLI1g"&gt;Though the initial trip to space may have been successful, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22826899/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-what-to-expect"&gt;there’s still a risky journey ahead for the James Webb Space Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, also known as JWST. Over the next month, the spacecraft will be journeying out to its final location 1 million miles from Earth. Along the way, the spacecraft will be slowly unfolding and reshaping itself to reach its final configuration, a process that is absolutely necessary for the telescope to observe the cosmos. There are hundreds of steps involved and plenty of moments where one bad deployment could jeopardize the entire mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYy5lB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if it all works out, JWST will become one of the most important tools we’ve ever had&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtE3m4"&gt;But if it all works out, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789561/nasa-jwst-james-webb-space-telescope-priorities-astronomy-astrophysics-exoplanets"&gt;JWST will become one of the most important tools we’ve ever had for peering into the distant recesses of space&lt;/a&gt;. With a gold-plated mirror stretching 21 feet, or 6.5 meters wide, JWST will be able to gather infrared light from galaxies that has crossed 13.6 billion light-years through space and time. So when JWST sees these distant clusters, it will be seeing them as they were 13.6 billion years ago, right after the Universe as we know it came into being. Astronomers believe that the Big Bang, which sparked the expansion of our Universe, occurred 13.8 billion years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LI22VD"&gt;On top of that, JWST will observe every kind of cosmic object we can possibly see, from distant alien worlds and black holes, galaxies, supernovae, and violent collisions between dense stars. And perhaps, we’ll see some things we were not expecting along the way. “We are, without a doubt, going to see surprises... the likes of which we can only dream of right now,” Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AwLJxKzg_AG2BC9yWNASPxAsudw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23125541/Screen_Shot_2021_12_25_at_7.25.00_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The first glimpse of the James Webb Space Telescope during the launch. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eOQUo0"&gt;JWST is often considered the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, which has been orbiting the Earth since 1990. However, JWST’s mirror will dwarf Hubble’s mirror, which is just 8 feet, or 2.4 meters, wide. This next-generation observatory promises to be 10 to 100 times more sensitive than Hubble and much more capable of picking up distant, faint objects. To emphasize JWST’s impressive capabilities, NASA claims that the telescope would be able to pick up the infrared light emitted by a bumblebee located at the distance of the Moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w2ZKe"&gt;Astronomers have dreamt of JWST’s capabilities for the last two and a half decades, but turning those dreams into reality has been a grueling process. Scientists formally proposed a massive infrared space telescope in 1996, and early mission engineers hoped to launch such an observatory as early as 2007 for a price tag as low as $1 billion. However, creating the spacecraft took much more time and money than anyone anticipated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17627560/james-webb-space-telescope-cost-estimate-nasa-northrop-grumman"&gt;JWST missed one target launch date after the next&lt;/a&gt;, while its budget ballooned by billions of dollars. Congress even tried to cancel the project at one point over the rising costs but agreed to continue funding the mission if NASA stuck to a cost cap of $8.8 billion. However, NASA blew through that, and the entire mission cost now sits at $9.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sojt6C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astronomers have dreamt of JWST’s capabilities for the last two and a half decades&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4VfwIx"&gt;Ultimately, JWST became known for consistently being late, with plenty of testing and construction mishaps on its road to launch. But after all the delays, hard work, and lessons learned, JWST finally arrived at its launch site in French Guiana this October, traveling by boat from California, where it had been undergoing final tests at the site of its primary contractor Northrop Grumman. However, the mishaps followed the telescope to South America. As engineers prepped the telescope for launch, a clamp holding JWST snapped and sent vibrations through the vehicle. And up until launch, flight personnel were working out a communications issue with the ground systems that supported the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GKxW4"&gt;After all of those headaches and tension, JWST miraculously made it to space in one piece this morning. “This countdown was as flawless as you can imagine,” Navias said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/geJbW28TF8D7CSBZyKuVZb5Fry4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23125549/51412123217_ba966ac1c2_o__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An artistic rendering of JWST completely unfurled in space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wLlyJB"&gt;But the telescope’s work is just beginning. JWST had to fly to space folded up, as it’s too massive to fit on any existing rocket in its final form. NASA and Europe agreed to fly JWST on Arianespace’s premiere Ariane 5 rocket back in the early 2000s, citing the vehicle’s reliability. Although Ariane 5 is nearly 18 feet, or 5.4 meters, wide, it was still not big enough to carry JWST to space completely unfurled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZBJu9"&gt;Now a long to-do list of deployments is in store for the telescope. JWST already deployed its solar array in order to get power from the Sun, and tomorrow, it will deploy its high gain antenna to communicate with Earth. After that, the telescope will slowly deploy various beams and structures, reconfiguring its shape so that it can observe infrared light of the distant Universe. Perhaps its most crucial deployment is its sunshield, which consists of five thin layers of a material called Kapton. In order to see in infrared light, JWST must stay incredibly cold. The sunshield is key for absorbing heat from our Sun, allowing JWST to remain a frigid -370 degrees Fahrenheit. The shield’s deployment must be perfect to guarantee the mission’s success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oYrcFt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Now a long to-do list of deployments is in store for the telescope&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CLSemO"&gt;Once that is complete, JWST will fully deploy its primary mirror, which also had to launch to space folded. The final test comes roughly 29 days from today, when JWST fires its onboard thrusters and puts itself into its final orbit 1 million miles from Earth. There it will live out the rest of its life, always pointed away from the Sun, until it runs out of fuel in five or 10 years. NASA is &lt;a href="https://jwst.nasa.gov/content/webbLaunch/whereIsWebb.html"&gt;providing live tracking of JWST’s position in space&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the status of all of these crucial deployments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIwLrL"&gt;Even if all those steps go well, it’s going to be some time before JWST’s science begins. First, it must cool down to cryogenic temperatures, and then scientists will have to test out all of JWST’s instruments to make sure they work properly. A roughly-six month wait is in store, but if we’re lucky, the first unbelievable images from JWST could be available this summer. NASA won’t say what those first images will be, but they promise to be stunners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9ysSo"&gt;“We want to surprise the world with what these images are going to be,” Amber Straughn, the deputy project scientist for JWST at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And those first science images, of course, are taken to be beautiful, stunning, amazing images. And I myself can’t wait to see what they are and to see what they look like.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the launch of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/foSPA64ahd8D-9oUyCbLVfK69Dg=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70315333/51746433586_625d55e635_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Wdliu"&gt;After nearly two and a half decades of planning and work, NASA is finally set to launch its next-generation space observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, this morning. The spacecraft will ride to space on top of a European Ariane 5 rocket, taking off out of Europe’s primary launch site in French Guiana, South America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dgV88i"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="JWST explainer|105132" data-volume-uuid="10e6068e6" data-volume-id="105132" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-400" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R7Q2ne"&gt;The launch is expected to last just 26 minutes to get JWST to space. Once it’s free of the rocket, JWST will then spend the next month traveling to its final destination roughly 1 million miles from Earth and slowly unfurling to reach its final form for probing the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I48VPN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What to expect from&amp;amp;nbsp;NASA’s James Webb&amp;amp;nbsp;Space&amp;amp;nbsp;Telescope launch  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22826899/james-webb-space-telescope-jwst-launch-mission-what-to-expect"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3R43NV"&gt;Here’s what you need to know to watch today’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NUsJ0g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I watch the launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tp6CXL"&gt;NASA plans to livestream today’s launch on its dedicated channel, NASA TV, with coverage starting at 6AM ET. You can watch the feed on &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/#public"&gt;NASA’s website&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. NASA is also providing a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nA9UZF-SZoQ"&gt;clean feed of the launch&lt;/a&gt; without commentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kXpvAf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time is the launch?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XanXlB"&gt;Arianespace has a launch window that begins at 7:20AM ET and ends at 7:52AM ET. The launch provider will strive to launch at the beginning of the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vRK5P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheduled launch time:&lt;/strong&gt; New York: 7:20AM / San Francisco: 4:20AM / London: 12:20PM / Berlin: 1:20PM / Moscow: 3:20PM / New Delhi: 5:50PM / Beijing: 8:20PM / Tokyo: 9:20PM / Melbourne: 11:20PM&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES 2022 loses Microsoft in Las Vegas over COVID fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CES-2016-stock-verge-09" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NI-3eZ6irX2SQAjACB8eAcrNo0g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70314597/CES-2016-stock-verge-09.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H1BOKW"&gt;Microsoft is the latest company to drop a physical presence at CES, as the increased prevalence of COVID-19 spooks exhibitors. It joins a growing list of major companies ditching the world’s largest technology show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9q0B2"&gt;“After reviewing the latest data on the rapidly evolving COVID environment, Microsoft has decided not to participate in-person at CES 2022,” a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. (The spokesperson declined to give their name because that’s how Microsoft prefers to announce event status changes.) Instead, the company will have a digital presence for both the Microsoft Partner Innovation Experience and Automotive Press Kit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vl78S"&gt;Microsoft was a featured exhibitor at the technology conference, and is now the latest to say it will not attend. Lenovo, T-Mobile, Amazon, the company formerly known as Facebook, GM, Intel, Twitter and Google have all pulled out, citing COVID-19 fears. The disease has been rapidly rising in prevalence again in the U.S., as a new variant sweeps through the population. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMLMEQ"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22852534/ces-2022-is-not-canceled-will-go-on-without-intel-google-gm"&gt;CES organizers insisted the event&lt;/a&gt; would go on regardless, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;required proof of vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, masks, and free rapid tests. On Wednesday, the Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, said 42 exhibitors have canceled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple must let dating apps offer alternate in-app payment options, says Dutch regulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DarfZ-TgKQE1f89Avy1Nn5Julvo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70314461/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o93swP"&gt;Apple must allow dating app developers to offer non-Apple payment systems for in-app purchases or face a hefty fine, &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-obliges-apple-adjust-unreasonable-conditions-its-app-store"&gt;according to a detailed ruling released today from the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets&lt;/a&gt; (ACM). The regulator has been investigating the company’s App Store practices since 2019, but &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-dutch-watchdog-finds-apple-app-store-payment-rules-anti-competitive-2021-10-07/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that it decided to focus on dating apps after receiving a complaint from Match Group, owners of dating services like Tinder, Match.com, and OkCupid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDc0Yc"&gt;This decision doesn’t apply to other app categories, like games or productivity apps, in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rab8EB"&gt;“Some app providers are dependent on Apple’s App Store, and Apple takes advantage of that dependency,” writes Martijn Snoep, chairman of the board of ACM. “Apple has special responsibilities because of its dominant position. That is why Apple needs to take seriously the interests of app providers too, and set reasonable conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pRNWO"&gt;In addition to allowing dating app developers to offer alternate payment systems, the Dutch regulator says they should also be allowed to point users to payment options outside the app. If the company fails to do so by January 15th, it &lt;a href="https://www.acm.nl/sites/default/files/documents/summary-of-decision-on-abuse-of-dominant-position-by-apple.pdf"&gt;faces&lt;/a&gt; a 5 million Euro-per-week fine, up to a maximum of 50 million Euros.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yMvgSU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ACM says Apple takes advantage of its dominant position&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxpTM0"&gt;Currently, app developers have to use Apple’s in-app purchase system, which lets the company take a 15- to 30 percent cut from any purchases customers make within an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUqQ9L"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Marni Goldberg said the company “disagree[s] with the order issued by the ACM and [has] filed an appeal.” She went on to say Apple “does not have a dominant position in the market for software distribution in the Netherlands, has invested tremendous resources helping developers of dating apps reach customers and thrive on the App Store, and has the right under EU and Dutch law to charge developers of these apps a fee for all the services and technologies Apple provides them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBGL1U"&gt;Still, governments around the world are scrutinizing Apple’s App Store rules. In September, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;announced an agreement with a Japanese regulator&lt;/a&gt; to let “reader apps,” like Netflix and Kindle, point users toward external sign-up pages where customers can provide credit card info, bypassing Apple’s system. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;South Korea passed a law&lt;/a&gt; in August that looks to let developers use payment systems other than the ones provided by platform owners and is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-lawmaker-says-apple-google-not-doing-enough-comply-with-app-store-law-2021-11-16/"&gt;reportedly deciding&lt;/a&gt; what Apple and Google will have to do to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGnHfH"&gt;The US was also planning on making Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;open up to third-party payment systems&lt;/a&gt; as a result of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;, but an appeals court &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22814147/epic-apple-app-store-injunction-paused"&gt;stayed that decision&lt;/a&gt; just before it was set to take effect, which could take months to resolve.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An app gave crucial seconds of warning before a major California earthquake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Earthquake Early Warning App" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UXdhsC0ZXXLk9kYPjtTnFDSVi08=/3x0:3575x2381/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313995/1176500948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Yichuan Cao/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oGJzNK"&gt;An early-alert system designed to give people crucial seconds of warning before earthquakes lived up to its promise on Monday. It buzzed through a half a million phones ahead of a 6.2 magnitude earthquake that hit northwest California — the largest quake since the system, called ShakeAlert, rolled out across the entire state, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/california-earthquake-early-warning-system"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9V8il2"&gt;ShakeAlert pulls information from the United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) sensor network. If data from those sensors says there will be major shaking in an area, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919639/california-earthquake-early-warning-system-app"&gt;people living there get alerts&lt;/a&gt; through the MyShake app (if they’ve downloaded it), or through the wireless emergency alerts system on their phones. Alerts also go out to Android users through a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362370/android-earthquake-detection-seismometer-epicenter-shakealert-google"&gt;partnership&lt;/a&gt; between Google, USGS, and the California Office of Emergency Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgf2xX"&gt;The epicenter of Monday’s earthquake was off the coast of a small town called Petrolia, and around 45 miles from the nearest population center, Eureka. People reported getting alerts around 10 seconds before shaking started, Robert de Groot, a ShakeAlert coordinator with the USGS, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/california-earthquake-early-warning-system"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it a successful proof of concept for the first substantial earthquake handled by the system. The quake didn’t do major damage to the area, and there were no fatalities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xw7MD"&gt;The ShakeAlert system was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682517/earthquake-warning-system-shakealert-la-app-alert"&gt;first introduced&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles in 2018, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919639/california-earthquake-early-warning-system-app"&gt;expanding to all of California&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. The system was in place in LA when a 6.4 magnitude earthquake hit around 150 miles outside of the city, but didn’t set off an alert because the expected shaking in the city &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682517/earthquake-warning-system-shakealert-la-app-alert"&gt;wasn’t strong enough&lt;/a&gt; to cross the app’s threshold. Users complained they didn’t get an alert even though they felt shaking, so the app’s developers lowered the threshold before the state-wide rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55HEhL"&gt;Now, the scientists behind ShakeAlert can use the information from this most recent earthquake to again improve the system for next time. “We are really going to learn the most from real earthquakes,” de Groot &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/21/california-earthquake-early-warning-system"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s giving us the chance to use the system and learn how to do a better job of alerting people.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google faces nearly $100 million fine in Russia over failure to delete banned content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PAzXfbdbezcFi6aM6HD39FjOTE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313983/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6gwf9L"&gt;A Russian court has fined Google $98 million over its failure to remove content deemed illegal in the country. The 7.2 billion rouble fine is around eight percent of Google’s revenue in Russia, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-court-fines-alphabets-google-72-bln-roubles-2021-12-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, and comes amid a broader push within the country to exert more control over big tech companies and the content people publish on their platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiZRJP"&gt;Google tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it will “study the court documents when they are available and then decide on next steps.” However, a Russian official &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-24/russia-steps-up-pressure-on-google-with-98-million-fine?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;cited by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; threatened “very unpleasant measures” if Google doesn’t comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-deletes-some-content-banned-russia-still-faces-fine-report-2021-10-05/"&gt;country’s mandate to delete banned content&lt;/a&gt;, which includes promotion of drugs and posts by organizations the government says are extremist or terroristic, including those associated with opposition leader Alexei Navalny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DPMM8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Russian regulators have issued fines and mandates in an effort to control foreign tech companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOeJ1k"&gt;This isn’t Google’s first fine in Russia over its content moderation. It &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russian-businessman-us-sanctions-list-claims-court-win-over-google-2021-12-16/"&gt;faces another&lt;/a&gt; that could double in size each week unless it reverses &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/918d2e15-b4d7-4d02-8961-6dfc4e76d68f"&gt;its ban on a conservative Russian news channel&lt;/a&gt;, though Google says the ban is due to &lt;a href="https://meduza.io/en/news/2020/07/28/citing-u-s-sanctions-against-russian-oligarch-youtube-permanently-blocks-right-wing-christian-orthodox-news-network"&gt;US and UK sanctions&lt;/a&gt; against the channel’s owner. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-twitter-mobile-slowdown-remain-until-all-banned-content-is-removed-2021-11-29/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-deletes-some-content-banned-russia-still-faces-fine-report-2021-10-05/"&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; have also faced slowdowns to their services and fines based on their failures in moderating to Russian regulators’ standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmTetu"&gt;Russian regulators have tried to pressure tech companies to comply in non-financial ways, as well. In 2019, the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20977459/russian-law-pre-installed-domestic-software-tvs-smartphones-laptops"&gt;passed a law&lt;/a&gt; that smartphones, computers, and TVs would have to come with software from Russian developers pre-installed, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334641/apple-follows-russian-default-apps-law-setup-screen-options-user"&gt;went into effect earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Companies will also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559383/russia-social-media-tech-company-office-law-signed"&gt;have to open offices in Russia&lt;/a&gt; if they run websites with over 500,000 daily visitors from the country. Russian officials have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679425/apple-google-remove-navalny-smart-voting-app-russian-election"&gt;leaned on Google and Apple&lt;/a&gt; to remove political opponents’ voting apps from their app stores by threatening to prosecute the companies’ locally-based employees.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You’ll miss 25 minutes of The Expanse’s final season if you don’t pause it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dNEdunfxXC0jYu5EGKrSRAZvALs=/491x0:3410x1946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313902/the_expanse_season_6_cast_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bu6Xr5"&gt;If you’re a fan of &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;, like me, you’re probably wondering whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716691/the-expanse-season-6-first-trailer-final-season"&gt;its final six episodes — currently airing each Friday through January 14th&lt;/a&gt; — are enough to wrap up its epic story. What you’re probably&lt;em&gt; not&lt;/em&gt; wondering: whether Amazon has buried nearly one-tenth of the show’s final season in a place you might not think to look, and can’t even find on your TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sJz8A"&gt;But it’s true. &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s production company filmed an additional 25 minutes of story across five vignettes, which you can only access through Amazon’s X-Ray service by &lt;em&gt;pausing the show&lt;/em&gt; and scrolling through otherwise hidden menus. (They’re under Bonus Content.) But I couldn’t find them on Apple TV or Google TV, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheExpanseWR/status/1472763062151041024"&gt;the showrunners have confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that’s because Amazon hasn’t made them available there yet. They’re only on phones, tablets, and computers for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lW8mWn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Unfortunately as of now, our X-rays aren’t available on TVs and can only be accessed on phones, tablets, or laptops. The series isn’t the easiest to find unfortunately but it’s definitely worth checking out! Thanks for watching!     &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheExpanseOneShip?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheExpanseOneShip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Expanse Writers (@TheExpanseWR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheExpanseWR/status/1472763062151041024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q00tX6"&gt;Fair warning: they’re not exactly &lt;em&gt;important&lt;/em&gt; to the plot, nor do they meaningfully fill in all the gaps. I’ve watched all six main episodes and all five X-Rays, and I wouldn’t say any of the side stories were strictly necessary. But they were absolutely worth my time, one of them was super fun, and I’d be angry if I never knew they existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MK2owa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They are in order and connected to the narrative”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ljwl2G"&gt;Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; showrunner and co-author Daniel Abraham tells me they were designed to be shown in order with the main episodes. “They are in order and connected to the narrative, so watch them in order,” he warned me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYqdxF"&gt;“The X-Ray [is] something we’ve been talking about doing for years, and we finally got to a place where we have the resources and time to get it done,” Abraham explains. “They’re small little character moments that create an extra scene with some depth to flesh out the mainline story. It’s very much like the novels where we had the little novellas on the side where we could give you things that weren’t critical to the main line, but could make the story a little richer and deeper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CMkh5"&gt;“They have little touchstones to the main line, and little touchstones to each other, just to spend that extra moment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gALsb5"&gt;Technically, &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/theexpansewr/status/1216076764675371008"&gt;has done some X-Ray bonus content before&lt;/a&gt;, offering a chance to go behind the scenes, and you’ll find a bunch of other &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSIizgaz-o0"&gt;aftershow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70OrDuorNYY"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; floating around the internet as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b5AJBY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Who wouldn't want to hang out on the Roci with Shohreh Aghdashloo? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheExpanse?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheExpanse&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fdLM1bMd1N"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fdLM1bMd1N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The Expanse (@ExpanseOnPrime) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExpanseOnPrime/status/1473420583706628096?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UdgOjJ"&gt;With a runtime of only 272 minutes sans credits, the tightly-edited final season can feel a bit cramped. The extra 25 minutes gives the series some much-needed breathing room. I might be biased, though: I’ll spend as much time with these well-acted characters as I can possibly get. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sex ed info on TikTok shows gaps in traditional education</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUtZU3nqoI3THCbnhBjFDBW4k8U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313862/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CCoHwO"&gt;Teens and adolescents might be turning to TikTok to learn about sex when their typical sex education isn’t sufficient. But the videos on the platform aren’t screened for misinformation and don’t give teens ways to ask additional questions, notes &lt;a href="https://mcusercontent.com/c20b80e633c1998112f620cfb/files/0017dc64-cb7d-8c68-8eb8-690168d497a1/Fowlerarticle.pdf"&gt;a new analysis.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69Fh8R"&gt;Sex education offered in schools in the United States is usually inadequate — most states don’t require kids to be taught about topics like contraception, consent, and gender diversity. Information about sex, though, is spreading on TikTok, which has millions of adolescent and teen users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ashtJu"&gt;To evaluate the sex education information on TikTok, one author of a new study created an account as a 15-year-old, downloaded 100 videos under the #sexeducation and #healthclass hashtags, and categorized them. Over half either focused on male and female anatomy or on sexual pleasure, with most focusing on female anatomy and female sexual pleasure. Thirteen percent talked about contraception, and only five of the sample covered other aspects of sexual health — like safe sex, consent, and how to navigate health care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7RTtQ"&gt;The volume of content on female sexual anatomy and pleasure on TikTok shows one area traditional sex education isn’t effective, the study authors note in their analysis. If teens are looking to TikTok for information on those topics, it might mean they’re not getting it elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1EKBW"&gt;Having a place to privately see information that might answer questions about sex could be helpful. However, adolescents looking through those videos don’t have a clear or easy way to get additional information if they have more questions, the authors said. They also may not have an easy or clear way to determine if a video includes misinformation. Some health care professionals make videos and answer questions on TikTok, but there are so many videos that it’s difficult to keep up with them all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jrs28X"&gt;“The ever-growing quantity of content available on TikTok makes responding to all misinformation impractical, and there is no guarantee a user will ever encounter these corrective videos,” the authors wrote. &lt;a href="https://gh.bmj.com/content/bmjgh/6/11/e007648.full.pdf"&gt;Other studies show&lt;/a&gt; that bad information about other areas of health, like COVID-19 and prostate cancer, has spread on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="271LL6"&gt;Considering the size of the platform — TikTok recently eclipsed &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/1-billion-people-on-tiktok"&gt;a billion monthly users&lt;/a&gt; worldwide &lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;experts should conduct more research evaluating the accuracy of sex education information presented on it, the study concluded. That recommendation is in line with a recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808011/tiktok-health-impact-research-plan"&gt;proposed research agenda for TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, which included a call for researchers to study the medical advice given on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eI4K97"&gt;In the meantime, doctors should ask patients about their social media use and could use that as a jumping-off point to answer questions or clear up any misinformation. “Providers have a critical role to play in anticipating common myths and misunderstandings and providing correct information about sexual health topics,” the authors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VV2fZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>8 great TikTok accounts from 2021 to follow </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJyyxXPHaEPqh0SSftlQVXOq8Ss=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313734/RoundUpArt_TikTok.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Put these great creators into your algorithm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rfKrRj"&gt;Maybe you’re new to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22585248/tiktok-guide-creators-video-how-to"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps you’ve been on the app for a couple of years and would like to find some new accounts to follow. While the algorithm does a shockingly great job of surfacing videos a user might like, it’s easy to get stuck in a bubble of repetitive content, so you’re seeing the same creators again and again or hearing one trending sound just a little too often. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2AS5U"&gt;I spend a lot of my downtime perusing TikTok, and I take pride in the list of accounts I follow. So much pride that I’ve got a sizable list of all the creators I’d recommend following. They range from creators who dole out advice to a forager and even to a heavy metal vocalist. If you’re just starting out on TikTok, these accounts are a great place to start. If you’ve been using it for a while, then unless we have the same algorithm, these accounts will be a good way to freshen up the videos you normally see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ea5YNl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey?"&gt;Oldtimehawkey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="PqFPoU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey/video/7035066592278973702" data-video-id="7035066592278973702" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@oldtimehawkey" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@oldtimehawkey"&gt;@oldtimehawkey&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;hot turkey sandwich   &lt;a title="comfort" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/comfort"&gt;#comfort&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Ylang Ylang - FKJ &amp;amp; ((( O )))" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Ylang-Ylang-6757899185262987266"&gt;♬ Ylang Ylang - FKJ &amp;amp; ((( O )))&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QzuwDZ"&gt;It never fails — when I’m feeling particularly emotional or stressed, oldtimehawkey pops on my For You page with his friendly catchphrase, “Well, hello there, buddy!” This creator’s videos are so calming, invoking a sense of serenity through the screen. The creator takes his followers through the marsh he lives in, alongside his dog. In most videos, he’ll cook himself and the viewer up a little something, split a couple of cold pops, and finally, he’ll have us sit down with him as he watches old VHS tapes or plays vintage Nintendo games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="XzXpkm"&gt;Mercury is one of the first creators I followed on TikTok out of sheer desperation after a few phone calls to my apartment’s maintenance team for embarrassingly easy fixes. She goes by Trans Handy Ma’am, and she doles out repair advice, life advice, and frequent hilarious anecdotes. Her videos have helped me on so many occasions that I actually keep some saved in my phone to send to friends in case they ever need repair advice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0chvXA"&gt;Jacob Soule, better known as theplantprodigy on TikTok, is my go-to for advice on how to keep my plants alive. He offers helpful, often sassy explainers on different plant types and how to take care of them. Additionally, he debunks a lot of viral plant “hacks” and tips, which saves me a lot of time. Admittedly, even after having followed him for nearly a year now, I still have managed to kill many of my house plants, but that’s totally on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PSCZOY"&gt;In a bout of misguided assumptions, I assumed the only plants that were edible were already sold in grocery stores. Come to find out from Alexisnicole, a vegan forager on TikTok, there is an abundance of delicious plants right outside my door. Alexis wanders around identifying and cooking up all types of different weeds, nuts, roots, and more. Not only are her videos extremely educational, but her excited way of sharing stories and telling the viewer how to get the most of something is incredibly contagious. I’m fortunate enough to be located in the same city as Alexis, so I use her videos as guides for what I can and cannot eat. So far, using her recipes, I’ve had great success putting hairy bittercress, purple deadnettles, lilac petals, and dandelions to use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="exvKqo"&gt;Don’t let Annrussel03’s nonjudgmental home and life advice deceive you. She won’t put up with any nonsense, and she’s not afraid to call commentators out for crossing lines. That being said, Ann gives wonderful tips on how to care for oneself and one’s home. I’ve kept her cleaning advice tucked in the back of my mind and have found it useful when I’ve got a particularly nasty mess to clean up. There are a lot of creators that try to do what Ann does, but no one delivers their tips in such an understanding yet commanding way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BcuZ8F"&gt;Dementia and Alzheimers run in my family, although I don’t currently know anyone who has it. These diseases alter a person’s memory, often making it easy for them to forget who their loved ones are or even where they’re located in the moment and why. I wish I would have had a source like this when my family members living with dementia were around. Teepa Snow is a wonderful educator, teaching viewers how to interact with people who have these diseases in a way that still respects that person and calms them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8iApx"&gt;Farah, known by the handle hippiearab, has a gift for witty and engaging storytelling. She’s one of the more recent accounts I’ve come across, and she was an instant follow for me. Her tales alone are rife with comedic value, but it’s really her perfectly timed pauses and witty asides that have me laughing out loud. One of her most successful videos (with 6.1 million views) is about a new chair that is both well designed and easily mistaken for a person at night. It is a perfect example of how she can turn a mundane topic into a hilarious story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="n5sxzd"&gt;I spent my high school days as a Scene kid going to heavy metal shows on the weekend. I loved the music, clothes, and community that came with these types of shows. However, it was a very male-dominated culture — I only ever knew of a handful of hardcore bands that had female vocalists. Jumping forward to the future, I found scenequeenrocks. Scene Queen has coined the term “bimbocore” and is bringing highly feminine aesthetics to heavy metal. She’s very tongue-in-cheek and unapologetic about taking up space within the heavy metal world. Her music goes hard, has a great message, and ultimately creates some diversity in a space where it’s needed. Rock on, Scene Queen, rock on. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The gadgets we broke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKj05xLsTWxfSuBmqxQ9WBgfPzw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70313731/acastro_211205_4931_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Verge has smashed a bunch of phones... and other things&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LIPDsv"&gt;This holiday season, let’s talk about the gadgets that are no longer with us anymore — not because they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727322/worst-gadgets-reviews-verge-first-decade"&gt;bad&lt;/a&gt; or became obsolete or were the victims of an upgrade offer too good to refuse, but because they met their demise in a delightfully destructive way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpvCll"&gt;We broke these gadgets without meaning to. (Probably. Helen is sus.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lv952B"&gt;This started out as a fun conversation in &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; private Slack, and now we’re bringing a more polished version to you. Also, feel free to share your own tales in the comments below this story!&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Wgfvbu"&gt;Canon EOS Rebel T5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="41LINs"&gt;I have a sassy cat named Pablo. As a very large boy, he’s quite particular about when he gets fed. Actually, sometimes he yowls at 4AM because he doesn’t like eating alone, making us sit with him as he chows down on kibble. A few months ago, our vet told us Pablo is “too young to be this fat,” and so, like a fool, I tried to put him on a diet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsjcOM"&gt;In retaliation, Pablo began a crusade of knocking things off high places. Several house plants were harmed, the dirt from their pots spilling like blood on our floor. We lost some good mugs. But the thing that hurt most was my camera, which I used to take product shots for my job. You know, the thing that helps me pay for Pablo’s food. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bosxVE"&gt;That day, Pablo was hangry about his new diet. I told him to wait. I was shooting a smartwatch and needed a bathroom break. He was displeased. I naively left it on a counter, thinking my lazy cat wouldn’t leap up just to spite me. But he did. I heard the crash from the bathroom, and when I came out, he was sitting there, smug, probably playing Taylor Swift’s “Look What You Made Me Do” in his little cat brain. Below was my camera, destroyed. I now feed him when he wants. &lt;em&gt;—Victoria Song&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pablo eats when he wants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdMPOp"&gt;iPhone 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sR3x91"&gt;Until 2014, I would have gladly and smugly told anyone I have never broken a phone. Then I broke the same phone &lt;em&gt;twice&lt;/em&gt;. I don’t remember how I first broke my iPhone 5. I think I dropped it at work. I vaguely remember people wincing and me trying to play off the shattering like it was no big deal (it was a very big deal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29AXLi"&gt;I finally got the money together to repair the phone — just in time for my mom to visit. The second day of her visit, we went to Ikea to look at furniture I could not really afford to buy. My mom kept saying I looked tired and frazzled. As we left the store, I took my phone out of my pocket and then... it just flew. Somehow, my dumb ass was too tired to actually hold onto the pricey device I’d just pulled from my pocket. The phone soared through the air and proceeded to land on the pavement, the crunch so audible a family walking by reflexively winced and looked on with sympathy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CsNRD"&gt;My phone was busted less than 12 hours after I had just had it repaired. My mom patted me on the shoulder and said I needed a nap.  &lt;em&gt;—Alex Cranz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our original HTC Vive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jKdhGr"&gt;HTC Vive&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WaA4l4"&gt;I lent &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s original HTC Vive headset to the Panorama music festival in the summer of 2016, back when virtual reality systems had months-long waiting lists. This is how I learned that VR screens get sunspots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vhOBn"&gt;And I didn’t even get to see The Arcade Fire. —&lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Vn5v1F"&gt;Handspring Visor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vytGPr"&gt;I still have a working &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22711230/springboard-handspring-documentary-secret-history-first-real-smartphone"&gt;Handspring Visor&lt;/a&gt;, and one regret — other than my inability to obtain the cellular modem backpack add-on — is that it isn’t the original device. Mine was replaced at an Ohio Best Buy thanks to the company’s perhaps overly generous early 2000s extended warranty plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIvcVJyga6P4D2Ky8DVyLD7TFwQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23118755/IMG_20191114_145151999.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Handspring Visor, still going strong.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9entK"&gt;Why did I need another Handspring Visor? The PalmOS-powered devices were incredibly durable, as evidenced by the fact that mine is still running 20 years later. However, my original device couldn’t survive being in my back pocket when I got body slammed into a table on a Saturday night. The exact details around the incident are hazy, and anyone who has ever visited Court St. in Athens can understand why. —&lt;em&gt;Richard Lawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VPAizP"&gt;Logitech Bluetooth Multi-Device Keyboard K480&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lMIkCd"&gt;To say I’m terrified of spiders would be an understatement. I once literally spent an entire night standing outside in the cold in my pajamas in an unsafe neighborhood because I found one on my pillow. I am not really certain why my brain registered a spider as more of a threat to my life than potential murderers lurking around, but there you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RVyeY"&gt;So, naturally, all rationality flew out the window when one day, a spider decided to crawl on my hands as I typed on my Logitech keyboard. I wailed like a banshee and threw my keyboard at the wall, then ran out of my room. When I eventually summoned the strength to walk back into my room one day later, I then not only sprayed everything — including my keyboard — with Raid, I also added some WD-40, hair spray, and perfume to cover the other awful scents. My keyboard, naturally, died, and it was all for nothing, really. I later found the spider near my bed and stopped sleeping in my room for nearly a month after that. &lt;em&gt;—Sheena Vasani&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9IxSwo"&gt;MacBook (2007)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6GxdRe"&gt;In the winter of 2010/2011, my MacBook’s hard drive died for the second time in less than four years. And with the laptop no longer under warranty, it made the most sense for me to replace the drive myself. A friend who lived down the street happened to have the fancy screwdriver needed to remove the drive’s housing. So one night, after I got the new drive in the mail, I put on a coat, grabbed my laptop, and walked a block through the snowy streets of Pittsburgh to get to his house around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8QCeB"&gt;The fix was easy: remove the battery, unscrew the housing, swap the new unit in, and put everything back in place. Soon enough, I was walking the block back home with a fixed laptop in hand. I remember crossing the street and hopping up onto the curb about halfway between our houses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GCP0zB"&gt;It was while falling sideways that I realized I had landed directly on a patch of black ice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="237Vxm"&gt;The laptop landed on its back right corner, exploding the plastic open, a thick silver bar of metal now jutting out between its body and screen. The screen hung off the body at an odd angle, attached only at the left and center portions of the hinge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDzir7"&gt;Somehow, it still worked. It felt like the laptop could have broken in two every time I opened it. But it managed to survive my final semester of college. When Apple finally refreshed the MacBook Air that July, I bought one the very first day. &lt;em&gt;—Jacob Kastrenakes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fuoMOE"&gt;Work-issued Blackberry, circa 2012&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="q6HkyH"&gt;When I started writing about consumer technology, the world was new, iPhones were still on the rise, and companies still issued Blackberry phones to their employees. I worked for such a company, so for a while in my 20s, I lived a two-phone lifestyle, carrying around my personal flip phone to text my friends and my work phone for work email. And you know, things my flip phone couldn’t do, like checking Facebook and Googling stuff. All very work-related, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7JSJV"&gt;As an aside, you haven’t really lived until you’ve sobbed openly at the McCarran baggage claim, typing out apology emails on your phone’s physical QWERTY keyboard for accidentally breaking an embargo. That’s another story, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ksfMA"&gt;Anyway, like I said, I was in my early 20s, and as such, I had a lot of &lt;em&gt;feelings.&lt;/em&gt; I could also leave home after 8PM on a weeknight, get drunk at the neighborhood karaoke night, and somehow function just fine at work the next morning. I came home from such a night feeling particularly emotional about something I don’t remember at all now. But at the time, it was &lt;em&gt;very upsetting&lt;/em&gt;, and it felt necessary to take off my coat and &lt;em&gt;throw it dramatically on the floor&lt;/em&gt;. My Blackberry was in the pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ce4o9"&gt;This would have been fine if I’d lived somewhere with carpeting. I did not; in fact, I lived in a former can factory converted into apartments with cement floors. My coat hit the floor just right, and I went from being just sad and drunk to being sad and drunk with a broken phone. I told work that my Blackberry “broke,” and if I remember correctly, they just sent me a new one without asking any questions. I learned nothing from this experience. &lt;em&gt;–Allison Johnson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Vef47"&gt;Pixel 3, 3a, and 3a XL&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WkizjT"&gt;I never needed a case for my phone. The early bombproof plastic phones simply &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; break, and I kept a firm enough grip on modern glass handsets that I rarely worried about it. But the family and I went for a beautiful island vacation in Maui, and I decided to try slapping a case on my new Pixel 3. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was my rainbow pic worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7rlWt9"&gt;As Google’s first IP68-rated phone, I knew I could take it with me into the crystal-clear Lahaina waters, and I was glad when I turned around to see this gorgeous rainbow overhead, dipping nearly all the way to shore. But after I waded back to land and started walking to the car, I realized my phone’s case was probably hurting more than it was helping, trapping water against the phone instead of drying out. I yanked it out... and fumbled. &lt;em&gt;SMACK &lt;/em&gt;— my phone hit the pavement screen-side down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXWnF0"&gt;Yep, my most protected phone yet, the one I was most concerned about protecting, was the one that broke. At least I didn’t pay full price — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2018/11/21/18107357/google-pixel-3-xl-black-friday-verizon-best-buy-sale-deal"&gt;I got it half-off&lt;/a&gt;. —&lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="snkFMX"&gt;
&lt;p id="vkPQ8Y"&gt;I’ve got another Pixel 3 breakage story, I’m afraid. I happily used one as my personal phone for 22 months before it died on me after a particularly lengthy smartphone briefing. Although I can’t say for sure, I’m almost certain it overheated thanks to running &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20996972/google-recorder-app-transcription-audio-available-pixel-2-3-3a-4"&gt;its useful auto-transcription software&lt;/a&gt; continuously for almost two hours while sitting in a case and wirelessly charging. It wasn’t particularly dramatic, but it was a useful reminder that there are limits to what a smartphone can do before it’ll give up the ghost. —&lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="T0wc30"&gt;
&lt;p id="J6R343"&gt;I &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; broke a Pixel 3 (XL). I ordered it right after launch, around Black Friday. I, too, was the type to keep phones bare or maybe use an adhesive skin to add grip and a pop of color, but the Pixel 3 was around the time phones started getting quite pricey, so I was persuaded by my wife (then, girlfriend) to protect it with a case. I used a thick clear-silicone case to start but later swapped it for one of Google’s fabric cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDQoon"&gt;Fast forward to the summer of 2020: I’m now working from home, I get up from my desk, slide the phone into my back pocket, and WHAM — it drops straight onto my hardwood floor, my partner right beside me — so we both get to witness the ensuing heartbreak. I pick it up to find a nice hairline crack across the full width of the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTEQTZ"&gt;I had accidentally dropped my phone plenty of times before, seemingly much worse than this one, but this short drop hit it just right. I tried covering up the crack with one of those glass screen protectors that use a liquid adhesive, but it was never the same. I keep it as a reminder and occasionally to take group selfies with its super-wide front-facing camera. &lt;em&gt;—Antonio G. Di Benedetto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ECLOAf"&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqs6t"&gt;It started innocently enough. My eight-year-old nephew wanted to give me a surprise present, so I tucked my Pixel 3a XL hurriedly under my armpit to look for him. Rather than take an extra second to put on a hoodie with a pocket for my phone, I dismissed my gut instinct with a casual “nah.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuConJ"&gt;When my sweet nephew handed me his favorite stuffed dog and told me to bring it to New York, I lost all common sense. I couldn’t help but receive this adorable present with two outstretched arms. It was at that moment that I heard a loud “clunk” and saw my Purplish 3a XL on the marble floor. I picked my phone up as nonchalantly as I could and shooed him away while I frantically hit the power button and swore under my breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3EHCo"&gt;It was a fatal drop for my beloved Pixel. Unfortunately, I wasn’t in Canada long enough to get the screen repaired, nor did the cost of a replacement screen ($200) make sense for a budget phone. My US phone was incompatible with my newly activated Canadian SIM card and cellular service. Don’t make the same mistake as me, kids: get a case, always travel with more than one phone, and use a damn pocket. —&lt;em&gt;Gloria Sin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3nid45"&gt;PlayStation (PSX) console&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="aVVrXt"&gt;This is an incidental breakage, not an accidental one. Nevertheless, it was devastating. In the two years after I received the PlayStation as a Christmas gift back in 1999 (sorry, Mom, I saw it in the closet a few months before, though I was still plenty excited), I played &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;many video games that the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psx/comments/a04s7p/one_of_the_little_plastic_pieces_circled_in_red/"&gt;circular CD-ROM holder&lt;/a&gt; in my PlayStation broke. &lt;em&gt;Legend of Dragoon&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dino Crisis 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tenchu &lt;/em&gt;1 and 2, &lt;em&gt;Um Jammer Lammy&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;Spyro&lt;/em&gt; trilogy in particular all clearly got a little too much playtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p77tj"&gt;I remember that archaic mechanism fondly. It was circular and housed a few small ball bearings that kept the disc in place. Flipped over, it had an orange rubber band that wedged inside of the plastic, likely to reduce vibrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwwk3Q"&gt;I super-glued all of the fragile plastic pieces together countless times, as the concept of it being a cheap, easy-to-replace part existed outside of my nine-year-old brain. I really thought I’d have to get an all-new console, bless my heart. But one day, I was playing a game, and it broke apart into several pieces while the console was running. That was the end of my PSX days. &lt;em&gt;—Cameron Faulkner&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="g479GY"&gt;iPad first-gen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hLrHa4"&gt;My first iPad was a “baby gift” from my husband to celebrate the birth of our daughter in 2011. In a convoluted way, it was the start of my journey into the smart home (my beat here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;) and the best gift you could give a person who spent six hours of every day glued to a couch feeding a baby. Then, just two years later, whilst navigating the cavernous aisles of Costco with a two-year-old and a five-year-old in tow, I made the mistake of lending it to my son. I desperately needed a distraction for him so I could focus on my shopping list, and he promised he would be good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ldlUM"&gt;Not more than five minutes later, I heard the chill-inducing sound of glass meeting concrete as my iPad landed face down on the warehouse floor. I hadn’t owned an iPad since (and neither has my son) until I finally gifted myself a new iPad Mini just last month. It’s good to be back. —&lt;em&gt;Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My car, full of water. Please excuse the iPhone 6S’s poor quality, my good camera was taking a swim inside the car.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GnQmS3"&gt;Nikon D500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="P7VR3F"&gt;When Hurricane Hermine hit Tallahassee in 2016, I had parked my car at the top of a hill next to a water drain — to keep it, and all the stuff I had inside of it, safe. Unfortunately, that didn’t pan out, and the back seat ended up flooded with a few inches of swampy water. It was&lt;em&gt; just&lt;/em&gt; enough to submerge the brand new Nikon D500 DSLR I had bought less than two months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6DzhJ"&gt;Despite the D500 being built like a tank and including “weather sealing,” it understandably didn’t survive the night. I mean, the car didn’t either — apparently, the car’s underseat computer can’t get wet? — but as a film student, I was way more bent out of shape about losing my camera than my transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgbW5D"&gt;Thankfully, Nikon was willing to repair the camera for around $400, which (if I remember correctly) meant replacing pretty much all of the internal components. I’m happy to report that, although I continued to endanger my camera and car by taking pictures in pools and off-roading through ponds, both survived long enough to make their way to new, hopefully more careful owners. &lt;em&gt;—Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gGoSWb"&gt;Huawei Mate 10 Pro&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tCEbLB"&gt;One of my favorite foods is lobster, and one of my favorite places to find lobster is a place called Abbott’s, a few miles south of Mystic, Conn. You place your order at a window, wait until they call your name, and then carry your tray full of lobster, corn-on-the-cob, and whatever else you ordered to a picnic table out on the lawn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANUm2v"&gt;This particular day, we had just parked after a long drive and started walking toward the restaurant when I took it into my head to make sure I hadn’t left my phone in the car. So I started searching through my backpack. I’d actually put it in an unzipped external pocket in that backpack; as I searched, it slipped out and crashed screen-down onto the ground. And since the ground was made up of loose gravel, the case I had around my phone was of no use whatsoever. When I picked it up, I saw that the top area of my screen was beautifully decorated by a spiderweb of cracks. I did not enjoy my lobster that evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFAjLE"&gt;If you have a phone that is neither an iPhone nor a Samsung, it can be nearly impossible to get the screen replaced. But since the phone still worked fine, I couldn’t justify buying another. So I spent a year using screen protectors to keep that display from getting worse until I finally broke down and bought a replacement. &lt;em&gt;—Barbara Krasnoff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Definitely not destroyed on purpose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4wvHcn"&gt;Pixel 4&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pqZA7P"&gt;I have hated my Pixel 4 since almost the first month I bought it. I should have heeded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;Dieter’s review&lt;/a&gt;, which pointed out the horrible battery life and huge top bezel. Instead, I traded in my beloved Pixel 2 — replacing my fingerprint sensor with face unlock just in time to mask up for a global pandemic. An 8-digit passcode is not fun to repeatedly enter when trying to grocery shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxAHj2"&gt;I have been complaining about my Pixel 4 so much that when I accidentally ran it over with my dad’s car this week, my partner accused me of doing it deliberately. So unjust! The screen is now splinters and random pixels, and I am rid of the Pixel 4 once and for all. At least the SIM card survived. As of today, I am using my dad’s old iPhone 6S until I can buy the iPhone 13 Pro — I do plan to take Dieter’s advice this time. —&lt;em&gt;Helen Havlak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1X7Bp"&gt;Nissan Leaf SL (2015)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="weQBqH"&gt;I think it’s safe to say that electric cars are now just devices that take you places. I made my first jump into driving pure EV with a used base model 2013 Nissan Leaf S. After delving nose-first into the addictive world of combatting range anxiety and getting my wife addicted to skipping gas stations, I decided to trade that in for a fully loaded 2015 Nissan Leaf SL. It came with an app to locate where it’s parked, remote A/C starting features, Bose sound, and premium materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfOsdI"&gt;After only six months of driving this beauty (only a Leaf owner can say that), it met its demise — a vehicle entering my lane from a construction site didn’t yield and stomped on its brakes. I could not brake in time, so it became my fault. Thankfully, I can say my Nissan Leaf leaves behind two loving owners and a properly restrained dog. —&lt;em&gt;Umar Shakir&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
