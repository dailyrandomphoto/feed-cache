    <title>The simple solutions to better games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oe_NCWgNPs72B1Rkgi65wnC5YQY=/0x392:1080x1112/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073931/VRG_ILLO_4853_10_Year_accessibility.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Game accessibility has come a long way, but there’s still more to do&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="YUz4lZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ItbV2F"&gt;In 2010, Ubisoft released &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;, an action-adventure game in which players use stealth and parkour to navigate a vibrant open world. It was one of the biggest games of the year, but it only came with two options that might generously be called accessibility features: players could customize the control scheme and turn on subtitles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqECVW"&gt;The subtitles were an improvement — the first game in the series didn’t have any at all — but they didn’t have labels to show which character was speaking, making it difficult &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2019/04/02/deaf-game-review-assassins-creed-brotherhood-revelations/"&gt;for players to follow conversations&lt;/a&gt; if they couldn’t hear the audio. There were no options specifically designed for people with vision, motor, or cognitive disabilities. For these players, &lt;em&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/em&gt;, like many games of its time, fell on a spectrum from frustrating to completely unplayable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6xnUe"&gt;In the 10 years that followed, the landscape of game accessibility changed dramatically. &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2020,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;has &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5Rys9UeXZh9bAjnHBZN4pC/assassins-creed-valhalla-bringing-accessibility-to-a-viking-epic"&gt;more than 30 accessibility options&lt;/a&gt;, including closed captions and subtitles with adjustable sizes, backgrounds, and the option to display speaker names. There are options for text to speech, colorblind modes, alternative inputs, aim assistance, and multiple difficulty settings. The game is still &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/tag/assassins-creed-valhalla/"&gt;far from perfectly accessible&lt;/a&gt;, but the evolution of the series points to growing investment in accessibility across the game industry over recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hZ9rTn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s been a slow climb up to this point.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzcOdm"&gt;“It’s been a slow climb up to this point,” says Steve Saylor, a blind game accessibility advocate. “But as the momentum has kind of grown, it just keeps getting faster and faster.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IW0hth"&gt;Accessibility has gradually become more of a priority across the tech industry. Phones, tablets, and computers come with a range of features built-in, from screen readers to support for different input options. Streaming platforms are slowly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352839/hbo-max-audio-description-warner-media"&gt;adding audio descriptions&lt;/a&gt; to more movies and shows. Social sites more often give users the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22587544/instagram-twitter-tiktok-accessibility-blind-low-vision"&gt;add alt text&lt;/a&gt; or captions to their content, and more people are learning to use them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VChbW"&gt;The shift toward accessibility is particularly tangible in games. The increased visibility of disability advocates and consultants across the internet, along with developments in tech and industry guidelines, has led to more focus on making games that are accessible to a wider range of people. “The amount of information you can get out there to help developers be aware of what changes they need to make, or what things to implement, is really, I think, more prevalent than it was 10 years ago,” says Kyle Abbate, a game accessibility advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OUBF8l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of games barely meet the minimum of accessibility options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2xByFq"&gt;Many players and developers credit Naughty Dog’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for raising the bar of what’s possible — and expected — in new games. The game, released in 2020, includes over 60 accessibility settings, as well as presets for players with vision, hearing, and motor disabilities. Other recent blockbuster games, like Insomniac’s &lt;a href="https://dagersystem.com/accessibility-game-review-spider-man-miles-morales/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22445946/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-ps5-accessibility-settings-insomniac-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, have been recognized for their wide-ranging accessibility features. Indie studios and developers are also upping the ante, with games like &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/15/severed-steel-a-new-fps-big-on-bullet-time-and-stylish-gunplay/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Severed Steel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/03/25/how-hyperdot-made-waves-in-accessibility-research/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HyperDot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;being influenced by research about and feedback from disabled players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZhlj3"&gt;But there’s still work to do. Plenty of games barely meet the minimum of accessibility options, and even those that exceed expectations have room for improvement. A more inclusive future is emerging in games — if the people making them care to reach for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPuBxT"&gt;“Even with &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; coming out with the amazing amount of accessibility that’s there, that doesn’t mean that it’s the end of accessibility,’’ says Saylor. “It just means it’s the end of the beginning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKPPz-HmuicynrHNtY4ddSjPiHY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963876/VRG_ILLO_4853_10Year_Accessibility_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="JCzXYH"&gt;More of the features that already exist&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UhamjY"&gt;I asked people for their biggest dreams about the future of games: new gadgets, augmented reality, brain implants. But most of them pointed to fairly simple solutions that they want to see more of, rather than tech possibilities straight out of science fiction. “The future of gaming, for me, is going to be a number of features that have already been slowly developing over the years,” says Ben Bayliss, editor in chief of &lt;em&gt;Can I Play That&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44ZrVd"&gt;As much as accessibility options have expanded, many games are still missing basic features like consistent captions or customizable controls. “It’s not really like I wish games would do ‘X’ thing; I just think that there needs to be more consistency,” says Abbate. He relies on the ability to remap controls in games, but sometimes even games that enable remapping have certain keys that can’t be changed. “You assume every game has remappable keybinds — it’s 2021, they should,” he says, “but you’d be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mBwRko"&gt;Abbate compares basic settings like control remapping to ramps for wheelchair users. “Just to get me into the game, that should be there,” he says. “Some games are still missing the ramp.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TXxu7K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Games still miss vital features, like the ability to change the size of text&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs0HPD"&gt;Saylor uses a number of options — rescaled UI, subtitles, increased text size, screen magnification, high contrast modes, text to speech, menu narration — when they’re available. But he says that even though games increasingly have at least some features, like subtitles, they’re often missing other vital features, like the ability to change the size of text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i12CSf"&gt;Those features are also lacking at the console level. Several console systems have “amazing options to navigate the system itself, but they don’t really tap into the games themselves,” says Saylor. “I would love to be able to see that meshed together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMrYQa"&gt;Players also want more games to have options like assist modes, invincibility options, or adjustable difficulty levels. &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hades-god-mode-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/43kadm/celeste-assist-mode-change-and-accessibility"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/casual-gamer-control-easy-mode-wait/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have compelling assist modes, some of which were added after launch in response to player feedback, but some developers (and fans) have been reluctant to sacrifice the difficulty that, for them, is a major part of a game’s appeal. Games like &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls,&lt;/em&gt; celebrated for being notoriously punishing, create a high barrier to entry for disabled players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV20uH"&gt;“I want to be able to play Souls-like type games and be able to complete those and customize the experience,” says Abbate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GBAjpm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’d love to see, at some point, the industry come together”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wxs2Fy"&gt;Accessibility features could also be advertised more prominently when new games are coming out, included in trailers and demos, and &lt;a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2021/04/22/accessibility-features-need-to-start-being-listed-on-digital-stores/"&gt;clearly listed in online stores&lt;/a&gt; and physical packaging. Google Stadia lists the accessibility features of games in its store, though they’re only visible to Stadia members. Xbox recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22702660/xbox-games-accessibility-feature-tags"&gt;launched accessibility feature tags&lt;/a&gt; for games in its stores, with games needing to meet specific criteria to get the tags. Many players also want the accessibility information within games to be easier to understand; menus packed with toggles and jargon can be overwhelming for people with cognitive disabilities or who just aren’t very familiar with games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox7RSU"&gt;“I’d love to see, at some point, the industry come together to say, ‘Look, here’s some standard ways we can talk about this stuff and let people know about this stuff ahead of time, before they preorder a game, before they purchase a game,’” says Brannon Zahand, senior gaming accessibility program manager at Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVAU13"&gt;More shared resources across the industry could make it easier to build in accessibility at all levels of game creation. Xbox has publicly available reference materials like the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/guidelines"&gt;Xbox Accessibility Guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/accessibility/gadpeg"&gt;Gaming and Disability Player Experience Guide&lt;/a&gt;, but the most robust guidance and testing go to developers that publish with Xbox. EA recently shared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638535/ea-accessibility-patent-pledge-apex-legends-ping-system"&gt;open patents and open-source code&lt;/a&gt; for its accessibility tech but doesn’t offer resources beyond those documents for how to implement the tech. Most large companies keep their tech solutions under lock and key, only sharing with their subsidiary studios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8cuJe"&gt;Game accessibility could advance more rapidly if publishers, game engine developers, and studios went a step further in sharing what they know, even if it means sharing with the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="o4plZP"&gt;Hardware improvements &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xQWq0C"&gt;Another major element of game accessibility is hardware. There are existing devices like the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Logitech’s Adaptive Gaming Kit, and Tobii’s Eye Trackers, as well as various mix-and-match solutions cobbled together by players. But clever devices, while useful, come with their own problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs50c7"&gt;“Everything is so expensive. And that’s just why we always create our own stuff,” says Abbate, who has cerebral palsy. “My setup is a USB touchpad velcroed to a piece of cardboard underneath my keyboard because it’s just 30 bucks,” he says, compared to around $200 for an&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Xbox Adaptive Controller and Logitech switches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rADZvQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hardware exists, but it’s often expensive and hard to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnOF1w"&gt;Whether a player goes for brand-name tech or homebrewed solutions, they need a fair amount of knowledge and effort to set it up. They have to decide which devices to try, figure out what adaptor cables are needed, map game controls to the equipment, and then get used to playing with something that’s not a conventional controller or keyboard — and all that work could be for just one game. Players might also have to reconfigure everything if they move from playing on a PC to a console and back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b5MBq"&gt;More people could use adaptive hardware if it was less complicated. “One of the challenges is that we have this great tech; you have an adaptive controller; we have switches; we have software accessibility settings of the platform and in the games. But if you don’t know about it, and you don’t know how to configure it, it’s kind of useless,” says Zahand. “So, I think part of it is in the future, we want to have more documentation to make it easier for people to understand this stuff. But I also think we want to use both some better inclusive design in how we build the tech itself, to make it easier to understand and comprehend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S22JKJ"&gt;The price and complexity issues might be reduced if hardware had more compatibility across a number of devices and software. “One thing that I really hope will happen is we’ll start to see companies — and not just game companies, but hardware companies, technology companies — start to think more about interoperability,” says Zahand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="k2pknq"&gt;The brain stuff&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ovlocd"&gt;There’s also the dream of being able to play games with your mind, performing actions by simply thinking about them, letting even people with very low mobility play complex games with little effort. None of the tech we currently have quite measures up to the idea of controlling a game with your thoughts, but there are some things in the works that might get at least a little bit closer within the next decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xf4s1J"&gt;EEG headsets, which sense electrical activity in the brain, have built some hype but are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10754436/commercial-eeg-headsets-video-games-mind-control-technology"&gt;generally more gimmick than science&lt;/a&gt;. An EEG can pick up patterns in brain waves, but the most accurate readings come from electrodes placed carefully on the scalp with conductive gel, not consumer headsets.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Some headsets have tested well for specific uses, like as controls for &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-50164-8_25"&gt;very simple game mechanics&lt;/a&gt;, but we’re likely still a ways out from them replacing other adaptive hardware options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T7XZeB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Though right now I can only play basic games, I still think that’s super cool.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xb9JXF"&gt;Myoelectric tech, which is more feasible for games, comes close to mind-reading by using electrical signals in muscles to control devices. Prosthetic limbs that are controlled with myoelectric sensors already exist, and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2018.00094/full"&gt;some researchers have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that video games could be useful for training people to use them. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/muscle-computer-interfaces-mucis/"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/19/future-apple-watch-could-monitor-muscle-movements-using-emg-sensors"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; have both researched the potential of myoelectric sensors for controlling devices, and Meta (aka Facebook) wants to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;myoelectric wristbands&lt;/a&gt; to complement its AR glasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gYdNY"&gt;At the more extreme end of these game control possibilities are brain implants. Nathan Copeland, who has a spinal cord injury, has spent six years &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2021/05/20/998725924/a-sense-of-touch-boosts-speed-accuracy-of-mind-controlled-robotic-arm"&gt;participating in lab research&lt;/a&gt; on brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs. Most of his time in the lab is spent controlling a robotic arm with his BCI, but he’s also been able to use it to play &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt; and other older games with basic control schemes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vifNnF"&gt;Copeland has enough motion in his arms to use adaptive controls like joysticks, but the BCI gives him another way to play. “Though right now I can only play basic games, I still think that’s super cool,” he says. “&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; is just a good game, no matter what. So if I can do it with my brain, it’s just a little extra challenge. I could plug my joystick in, and I could do it better with the functionality and the equipment I have, but that’s not the funnest way to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wx1ERo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The focus isn’t really on games&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wDAJNL"&gt;Researchers are able to record signals in Copeland’s brain when he thinks about different arm or hand movements and map them to a robotic arm, a process that can also be applied to controlling a cursor or pressing keys. “If you can imagine doing different hand postures, you could potentially map that onto buttons on a video game controller,” says Jennifer Collinger, one of the researchers who work with Copeland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbwlkS"&gt;“I think the field has really progressed a lot in the last 10 years in terms of the complexity of control that can be demonstrated at the same time,” says Collinger. But there’s still plenty of research to be done, and she doesn’t expect much of a consumer market for BCIs. Their potential is more as tools for restoring limb function, communication, and computer access for people like Copeland. “Because it requires a brain implant, I don’t think that anybody is specifically trying to develop an implanted technology for video game control,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SOdkDp"&gt;Cultural shifts&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rwMaf9"&gt;Beyond all the things that go into games and how they’re played, there are changes needed in the broader culture around gaming. There’s still a lot of ignorance about disabled players, even as awareness for accessible gaming has increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEmpB8"&gt;“I want to see a gaming world in which players don’t feel excluded,” says Bayliss, “and where the community is more inclusive and understands and accepts features such as invincibility modes and doesn’t belittle people’s needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="oJ7nzR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Let me play how I want to play; you go play how you want to play.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2enSg"&gt;The game industry is changing. Game makers are thinking about accessibility earlier in development, sometimes even making games specifically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631651/the-vale-shadow-of-the-crown-blind-audio-xbox-pc"&gt;geared toward previously unconsidered players&lt;/a&gt;. Accessibility is on the rise, but a cultural shift has to happen to keep the momentum going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJntbK"&gt;There continue to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DoubleFine/status/1413619563166584834"&gt;public debates&lt;/a&gt; about difficulty options in games, which is tiresome for players who have to hear people argue against their inclusion. “We shouldn’t dictate to people how they play the game — just allow them to play,” says Abbate. “You’re not in my house. Let me play how I want to play; you go play how you want to play.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAxpd2"&gt;And as much as accessibility has entered more mainstream conversations, it’s still not often addressed in game reviews outside of dedicated sites. “I would love to be able to see that being talked about and accessibility be included as part of reviews and a part of coverage for video games because then, that allows disabled players to be a part of the hype,” says Saylor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHur9J"&gt;The hope is that players will be able to spend more time experiencing that hype and less time pleading for the same basic features. Steven Spohn, COO of AbleGamers, says that it’s impossible for any game to be completely accessible for every single person. But he does see a future where broader accessibility becomes the standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fr9DA"&gt;“Is there a time I can foresee in 10 years where we have a lot of this is finally figured out,” says Spohn, “and a lot of it is just default and baked into engines and the different building platforms that these publishers use to make the games? Absolutely, I can see where it’s going to continue to get better and get better.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The metaverse, the multiverse, and the end of your free time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FIUFXVCGh6JTKYIGRo9EG_ePtI0=/0x553:1080x1273/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073895/VRG_ILLO_4852_10_Year_metaverse.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;In a decade, entertainment will try to be everything &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="2AUmtR"&gt;It’s impossible to predict what the biggest movie will be in a decade. The same goes for games and music, even sports and social networks. Given the speed at which culture moves, it’s really anyone’s guess. Maybe superheroes will continue to reign supreme. Maybe in 10 years, frisbee golf will finally get its due and blow up on Vine 4.0. But there is one thing that could very well happen: the most popular movie, game, social network, and sport could actually be the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLe8b4"&gt;The idea of products that span different mediums isn’t new. There have always been licensed video games, and Marvel’s entire model involves putting stories about Captain America and Spider-Man in as many places as possible, whether it’s comic books or blockbuster movies or a new streaming series. But the last few years have given rise to a new kind of all-encompassing entertainment experience that tries to give you everything and demands all of your time in return. It’s a highlander mentality: in the eyes of the biggest entertainment companies, there can be only one. And right now, this comes in two forms. You’re either sucked into a multiverse, or you’re spending your life in a metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ql4juD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The metaverse mentality: create a game or virtual world that has everything you could ever want&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8J4RO"&gt;Often, this starts out as a video game. A little over a decade ago, Riot released &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, a five-vs.-five strategy game set in a fantasy realm where players took control of various magical beings in an attempt to destroy the other team’s crystal. In many ways, it was just another multiplayer PC game, one that didn’t seem all that unique compared to Valve’s &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oybYvU"&gt;Today, it’s something completely different. The game remains fundamentally the same, but everything around it has changed. There are &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; comic books and a Netflix series. The game has three virtual bands with albums you can stream on Spotify, ranging from metal to K-pop, and a character that started out as a virtual influencer on Instagram. Those bands have “performed” through the magic of AR and holograms while decked out in Louis Vuitton, at the annual &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship, an esports event with tens of millions of viewers and professional teams across the globe, each of which competes in their own regional leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvjWp7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;is no longer a game — it’s a lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4tjq8"&gt;The same could be said of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which began life as a battle royale and now hosts movie festivals and concerts and copies any game that challenges its place on top. It’s one of the most popular hangouts for teenagers, to the point that developer Epic even added an area devoid of violence where you can virtually party. It’s the metaverse mentality: the idea is to create a game or virtual world that has everything you could ever want. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; are stories and sports and social spaces and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aWHjPosANudzh37hVgPECmcDy_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963891/VRG_ILLO_4852_10Year_Metaverse_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9w36or"&gt;Concepts like transmedia and virtual worlds have floated around for years, but they’re taking off now thanks to a mix of improved technology (&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is a lot more fun than &lt;em&gt;Second Life &lt;/em&gt;ever was) and proven success (when every Marvel movie makes $1 billion, everyone wants their own cinematic universe). Couple this with the pandemic, which saw entertainment and virtual communication skyrocket, and you have a huge shift in how we interact with each other and the stories we watch and play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XjQoMt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When these things become so large and all-consuming, it doesn’t leave much room for anything else&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dU265T"&gt;The success of these games and comics turned-all-consuming-entertainment-experiences has changed the way companies approach new ideas. Sure, standalone blockbuster movies still come out from time to time, and single-player video games haven’t completely disappeared. But they’re becoming increasingly rare. Everything competes with everything; it’s Netflix versus &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; versus TikTok. In order to stay relevant, you can’t be just one thing. When Krafton, the company behind &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, announced it was licensing the Korean fantasy novel &lt;em&gt;The Bird That Drinks Tears&lt;/em&gt;, it didn’t reveal a game or a movie but rather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22639319/krafton-pubg-project-windless-fantasy-franchise"&gt;plans for a multimedia franchise&lt;/a&gt;. One of the goals of Amazon’s game division is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686351/amazon-games-christoph-hartmann-twitch-luna-new-world"&gt;come up with a property that can become a Prime Video series or movie&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix and Amazon are making games; Riot and Ubisoft are making TV shows. A &lt;em&gt;Pokémon &lt;/em&gt;esports league is likely to happen at some point. Facebook just rebranded its entire company around metaverse software that barely exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdTTMy"&gt;This is only going to get more pronounced. Companies are investing more and more into projects, thinking of them as genre- and medium-spanning franchises from the very beginning. You can’t listen to a modern media executive talk for more than a minute without hearing either “IP” or “metaverse.” This is great news if you happen to love &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. But there are very obvious drawbacks, and they’re already happening. Disney’s blockbusters are pushing smaller and mid-tier films out of theaters. Netflix is suffering from content overload, making it hard to find all but the most popular titles. Live-service games have become so lucrative that large publishers are chasing the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; high with their own never-ending titles. The problem is that when these things become so large and all-consuming, it doesn’t leave much room for anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tSfOur"&gt;The way things are going, it doesn’t seem like these projects will get any smaller. Instead, their scale will likely grow to absurd proportions. You’ll go to see the trailer for the new &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; movie on a screen inside Fortnite, sipping an IRL can of Slurp Juice while your friend sits beside you and talks, looking like a deepfaked version of Peely. It’ll be a new kind of verse, where multi and meta combine, and free time is nonexistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Bu2lb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hce59U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The future of AI is a conversation with a computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83_ZI3EDbyMPLcyMW-b0d8IOLlc=/0x658:1080x1378/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073883/VRG_ILLO_4851_10_Year_ai.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;AI writing tools can tell us a lot about artificial intelligence&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L1S8Gy"&gt;How would an AI writing program start an article on the future of AI writing? Well, there’s one easy way to find out: I used the best known of these tools, OpenAI’s GPT-3, to do the job for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4StTG"&gt;Using GPT-3 is disarmingly simple. You have a text box to type into and a menu on the side to adjust parameters, like the “temperature” of the response (which essentially equates to randomness). You type, hit enter, and GPT-3 completes what you’ve written, be it poetry, fiction, or code. I tried inputting a simple headline and a few sentences about the topic, and GPT-3 began to fill in the details. It told me that AI uses “a series of autocomplete-like programs to learn language” and that these programs analyze “the statistical properties of the language” to “make educated guesses based on the words you’ve typed previously.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJTy8a"&gt;So far, so good, I thought. I hit enter again, and the program added a quote from Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean, then referenced an experimental piece of software from the 1960s before promising that an “AI Revolution” was coming that would reap immense rewards across the fields of science, technology, and medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="znB7mV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48hFNM"&gt;Fine, I thought. Then I thought a little more and did some googling. I soon discovered that the quote from Dean was made up, that the experimental software never existed, and while the promise of an “AI Revolution” was all well and good, it wasn’t any different from the vague nonsense found in hype-filled press releases. Really, what was most revealing about the future of AI was not &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; GPT-3 said but &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; it said it. The medium is the message, as Marshall McLuhan pointed out many years ago. And here, the medium included plausible fabrications; endless output; and, crucially, an opportunity to respond to the robot writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdFDTd"&gt;If we’re looking ahead at the next 10 years of AI development, trying to predict how we will interact with increasingly intelligent software, it helps to consider those tools that can talk back. AI writing models may only be digital parrots, able to copy form without understanding meaning, but they still create a dialogue with the user. This is something that often seems missing from the introduction of AI systems like facial recognition algorithms (which are imposed upon us) or self-driving cars (where the public becomes the test subject in a dangerous experiment). With AI writing tools, there is the possibility for a conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LbLGbM"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="alQiPa"&gt;If you use Gmail or Google Docs, then you’ve probably already encountered this technology. In Google’s products, AI editors lurk in the blank space in front of your cursor, manifesting textual specters that suggest how to finish a sentence or reply to an email. Often, their prompts are just simple platitudes — ”Thanks!”, “Great idea!”, “Let’s talk next week!” — but sometimes these tools seem to be taking a stronger editorial line, pushing your response in a certain direction. Such suggestions are intended to be helpful, of course, but they seem to provoke annoyance as frequently as gratitude.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZj8PZ"&gt;To understand how AI systems learn to generate such suggestions, imagine being given two lists of words. One starts off “eggs, flour, spatula,” and the other goes “paint, crayons, scissors.” If you had to add the items “milk” and “glitter” to these lists, which would you choose and with how much confidence? And what if that word was “brush” instead? Does that belong in the kitchen, where it might apply an egg wash, or is it more firmly located in the world of arts-and-crafts? Quantifying this sort of context is how AI writing tools learn to make their suggestions. They mine vast amounts of text data to create statistical maps of the relationships between words, and use this information to complete what you write. When you start typing, they start predicting which words should come next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZUidJ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Their ability to actually &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; language is a topic of hot debate, but their fluency across genres is undeniable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkuilR"&gt;Features like Gmail’s Smart Reply are only the most obvious example of how these systems — often known as large language models — are working their way into the written world. AI chatbots designed for companionship have become increasingly popular, with some, like Microsoft’s Chinese Xiaoice, attracting &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210824-always-there-the-ai-chatbot-comforting-china-s-lonely-millions"&gt;tens of millions of users&lt;/a&gt;. Choose-your-own-adventure-style text games with AI dungeon masters are attracting users by letting people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042942/ai-dungeon-nick-walton-openai-gpt2-text-adventure-game-web-version-launch"&gt;tell stories collaboratively with computers&lt;/a&gt;. And a host of startups offer multipurpose AI text tools that summarize, rephrase, expand, and alter users’ input with varying degrees of competence. They can help you to write fiction or school essays, say their creators, or they might just fill the web with endless spam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3EfcZ"&gt;The ability of the underlying software to actually &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; language is a topic of hot debate. (One that tends to arrive, time and time again, at the same question: what do we mean by “understand” anyway?). But their fluency across genres is undeniable. For those enamored with this technology, scale is key to their success. It’s by making these models and their training data bigger and bigger that they’ve been able to improve so quickly. Take, for example, the training data used to create GPT-3. The exact size of the input is difficult to calculate, but one estimate suggests that the entirety of Wikipedia in English (3.9 billion words and more than 6 million articles) makes up only 0.6 percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUSX8G"&gt;Relying on scale to build these systems has benefits and drawbacks. From an engineering perspective, it allows for fast improvements in quality: just add more data and compute to reap fast rewards. The size of large language models is generally measured in their number of connections, or parameters, and by this metric, these systems have increased in complexity extremely quickly. GPT-2, released in 2019, had 1.5 billion parameters, while its 2020 successor, GPT-3, had more than 100 times that — some 175 billion parameters. Earlier this year, Google announced it had trained a language model with &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/12/google-trained-a-trillion-parameter-ai-language-model/"&gt;1.6 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; parameters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMsZ4x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, and they will lie thoughtlessly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZR47YV"&gt;The difference in quality as systems get larger is notable, but it’s unclear how much longer these scaling efforts will reap rewards in quality. Boosters think that sky’s the limit — that these systems will keep on getting smarter and smarter, and that they may even be the first step toward creating a general-purpose artificial intelligence or AGI. But skeptics suggest that the AI field in general is starting to reap &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/deep-learning-computational-cost"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; as it scales ever up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGUPIA"&gt;A reliance on scale, though, is inextricably linked to the statistical approach that creates uncertainty in these models’ output. These systems have no centralized store of accepted “truths”; no embodied understanding of “what the world is like for humans” and, hence, no way to distinguish fact from fiction or to exercise common sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG6txs"&gt;Quiz them on simple trivia, like capital cities or the birthdays of US presidents, and they are right &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of the time. But to these systems, truth is simply a statistical feature of their training data. They answer questions correctly because the text they’ve been fed has presented them with the correct information with enough frequency. This means that if you push them on any given topic or stray from the most obvious fields, they will lie thoughtlessly, making up quotes, dates, biographical details, and anything else you want to hear. The same probabilistic approach also means they can stumble over &lt;a href="https://lacker.io/ai/2020/07/06/giving-gpt-3-a-turing-test.html"&gt;common sense questions&lt;/a&gt;. Start quizzing them with slightly fantastical queries, and they will confidently assert, for example, that a pencil is heavier than a toaster or that a blade of grass only has one eye. Such answers reveal the gulf between statistical and embodied intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JXcF-qv_7EnqiKqnlUiCG-c1iyc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963890/VRG_ILLO_4851_10Year_AI_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="wYMzl0"&gt;To get a better understanding of these AI language models, I’ve been playing with a variety for the past few weeks; from tools sold to copywriters to flexible, multipurpose systems like GPT-3. The experience has been dizzying. Often, I’m amazed by the fluency, insight, and creativity of these systems. As part of a project for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s 10-year anniversary, for example, I used GPT-3 to write technopagan spells for a zine, feeding it a prompt (below in bold) which it completed with a four-step ritual (of which I’m showing only the first step):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="khmfKr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technopaganism is a new sort of magic that blends traditional witchcraft with the power of being online all the time. What follows is a technopagan spell designed to protect your phone from spam and improve the quality of messages you receive. Step 1)&lt;/strong&gt; Take your cell phone and go outside. Close your eyes, hold the device in front of you, and intone: “I offer you, O Spirit of Technopagan Magic, my eternal and unending electronic connection to the net. And in return I ask you for magick to combine my will with the will of the system — make me impervious to the garbage that flows through my inbox. Make all messages flow together, and I will choose among them what is right for me to see. Grant me the Finger of the Internet, and I will strike at spam, and cast out the spammers back to the dark places where they come from.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FhfFhd"&gt;But other times, I’m stunned by how limited these programs are. Something that’s often overlooked is just how much human curation is needed to shape their output. The text above was not the first response I received from GPT-3, and I had to go through several iterations to generate a response that was both cogent and funny. It helped, of course, that the task I’d set GPT-3 was an imaginative and open-ended one: it played into the program’s strengths (and I think GPT-3’s success in such tasks has led some users and observers to exaggerate the intelligence of these systems). Other times, though, the software produced nonsensical content even within the fanciful framing I’d given it. Another “spell” it generated in response to the same prompt was much less focused, adding fictitious social media handles, tech headlines, and non-existent URLs to the spell’s instructions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S4dMmp"&gt;Perform a ritual to seal the crown circle into the device. May the gods help us all, the Apple iPhone X reference for is broken! Destroy the holy symbol! —tianong xiong (@tianongxiong) September 13, 2018 To confirm the rumor: Facebook Messenger’s search bar does have a search bar hidden right next to it pic.twitter.com/DghBL5DmhU — Warl Darkh (@dkpt) September 12, 2018 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wcDBuF"&gt;You can argue that this is just creativity of a different sort, and that of course a &lt;em&gt;proper&lt;/em&gt; technopagan spell would include URLs. But it’s also obvious the machine has gone off-piste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B3Ejd"&gt;Despite such weaknesses, there’s already talk of AI systems taking over writers’ jobs. Naturally, I wondered if a computer could write articles for &lt;em&gt;The Verge (&lt;/em&gt;and not just this one). I played around with different models, inputting opening paragraphs into these systems and asking for story ideas. Here is some more from GPT-3 on large language models: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EJdiz0"&gt;“The human brain is just a really fancy computer,” said Jeff Dean, a Google hardware engineer and AI expert, at a company event in 2016. “It’s a computer made of meat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FlGZH"&gt;To understand GPT-3, you first have to know a little about how the brain learns. The brain isn’t born knowing how to speak or understand speech. It must first acquire this ability through exposure to the outside world, which is why children tend to learn language so quickly, and why being raised in a household where a language isn’t spoken presents a major obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq4dBU"&gt;As neuroscientist Mark Changizi has shown, the process of learning a language is a massive project. “Language is one of the most complex things that brains can do,” he writes, “and it emerges from the brain’s more basic skills, like vision, hearing, and motor control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJ375F"&gt;But how does the brain acquire all this knowledge? The short answer is: via autocomplete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="avw9lt"&gt;All these points make sense if you’re not concentrating too hard, but they don’t flow from sentence to sentence. They never follow an argument or build to a conclusion. And again, fabrication is a problem. Both Jeff Dean and Mark Changizi are real people who have been more or less correctly identified (though Dean is now head of AI at Google, and Changizi is a cognitive scientist rather than a neuroscientist). But neither man ever uttered the words that GPT-3 attributed to them, as far as I can tell. Yet despite these problems, there’s also a lot to be impressed by. For example, using “autocomplete” as a metaphor to describe AI language models is both accurate and easy to understand. I’ve done it myself! But is this because it’s simply a common metaphor that others have deployed before? Is it right then to say GPT-3 is “intelligent” to use this phrase or is it just subtly plagiarizing others? (Hell, I ask the same questions about my own writing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tNzq9u"&gt;Where AI language models seem best suited, is creating text that is rote, not bespoke, as with Gmail’s suggested replies. In the case of journalism, automated systems have already been integrated into newsrooms to write “fill in the blanks” stories about earthquakes, sporting events, and the like. And with the rise of large AI language models, the span of content that can be addressed in this way is expanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="miicbM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMrCL7"&gt;Samanyou Garg is the founder of an AI writing startup named Writesonic, and says his service is used mostly by e-commerce firms. “It really helps [with] product descriptions at scale,” says Garg. “Some of the companies who approach us have like 10 million products on their website, and it’s not possible for a human to write that many.” Fabian Langer, founder of a similar firm named AI Writer, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his tools are often used to pad out “SEO farms” — sites that exist purely to catch Google searches and that create revenue by redirecting visitors to ads or affiliates. “Mostly, it’s people in the content marketing industry who have company blogs to fill, who need to create content,” said Langer. “And to be honest, for these [SEO] farms, I do not expect that people really read it. As soon as you get the click, you can show your advertisement, and that’s good enough.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKswYJ"&gt;It’s this sort of writing that AI will take over first, and which I’ve started to think of as “low-attention” text — a description that applies to both the effort needed to create and read it. Low-attention text is not writing that makes huge demands on our intelligence, but is mostly functional, conveying information quickly or simply filling space. It also constitutes a greater portion of the written world than you might think, including not only marketing blogs but work interactions and idle chit-chat. That’s why Gmail and Google Docs are incorporating AI language models’ suggestions: they’re picking low-hanging fruit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M7i2go"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effects&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b2AiNE"&gt;A big question, though, is what effect will these AI writing systems have on &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; writing and, by extension, our culture? The more I’ve thought about the output of large language models, the more it reminds me of &lt;a href="https://theprepared.org/features-feed/on-geofoam"&gt;geofoam&lt;/a&gt;. This is a building material made from expanded polystyrene that is cheap to produce, easy to handle, and packed into the voids left over by construction projects. It is incredibly useful but somewhat controversial, due to its uncanny appearance as giant polystyrene blocks. To some, geofoam is an environmentally-sound material that fulfills a specific purpose. To others, it’s a horrific symbol of our exploitative relationship with the Earth. Geofoam is made by pumping oil out of the ground, refining it into cheap matter, and stuffing it back into the empty spaces progress leaves behind. Large language models work in a similar way: processing the archaeological strata of digital text into synthetic speech to fill our low-attention voids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MGEyWR"&gt;For those who worry that much of the internet is already “&lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2018/12/how-much-of-the-internet-is-fake.html"&gt;fake&lt;/a&gt;” — sustained by botnets, traffic farms, and automatically generated content — this will simply mark the continuation of an existing trend. But just as with geofoam, the choice to use this filler on a wide scale will have structural effects. There is ample evidence, for example, that large language models encode and amplify social biases, producing text that is racist and sexist, or that repeats harmful stereotypes. The corporations in control of these models pay lip service to these problems but don’t think they present serious problems. (Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;famously&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22292011/google-second-ethical-ai-researcher-fired"&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; two of its AI researchers after they published a &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;detailed paper&lt;/a&gt; describing these issues.) And as we offload more of the cognitive burden of writing onto machines, making our low-attention text no-attention text, it seems plausible that we, in turn, will be shaped by the output of these models. Google already uses its AI autocomplete tools to suggest &lt;a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/05/19/google-to-suggest-more-inclusive-terms-with-assisted-writing-tool-14608473/"&gt;gender-neutral language&lt;/a&gt; (replacing “chairman” with “chair,” for example), and regardless of your opinion on the politics of this sort of nudge, it’s worth discussing what the end-point of these systems might be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSH7PZ"&gt;In other words: what happens when AI systems trained on our writing start training us? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DAsPxe"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JHkv5k"&gt;Despite the problems and limitations of large language models, they’re already being embraced for many tasks. Google is making language models central to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22696268/google-search-on-updates-ai-mum-explained"&gt;various search products&lt;/a&gt;; Microsoft is using them to build &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451144/microsoft-gpt-3-openai-coding-autocomplete-powerapps-power-fx"&gt;automated coding software&lt;/a&gt;, and the popularity of apps like Xiaoice and AI Dungeon suggests that the free-flowing nature of AI writing programs is no hindrance to their adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oz3RMV"&gt;Like many other AI systems, large language models have serious limitations when compared with their hype-filled presentations. And some predict this widespread gap between promise and performance means we’re heading into another period of AI disillusionment. As the roboticist Rodney Brooks &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/rodney-brooks-ai/particle-1"&gt;put it&lt;/a&gt;: “just about every successful deployment [of AI] has either one of two expedients: It has a person somewhere in the loop, or the cost of failure, should the system blunder, is very low.” But AI writing tools can, to an extent, avoid these problems: if they make a mistake, no one gets hurt, and their collaborative nature means human curation is often baked in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yAYgYo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ3hnQ"&gt;What’s interesting is considering how the particular characteristics of these tools can be used to our advantage, showing how we might interact with machine learning systems, not in a purely functional fashion but as something exploratory and collaborative. Perhaps the most interesting single use of large language models to date is a book named &lt;em&gt;Phamarko AI: &lt;/em&gt;a text written by artist and coder K Allado-McDowell as an extended dialogue with GPT-3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz6SPM"&gt;To create &lt;em&gt;Phamarko AI&lt;/em&gt;, Allado-McDowell wrote and GPT-3 responded. “I would write into a text field, I would write a prompt, sometimes that would be several paragraphs, sometimes it would be very short, and then I would generate some text from the prompt,” Allado-McDowell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I would edit the output as it was coming out, and if I wasn’t interested in what it was saying, I would cut that part and regenerate, so I compared it to pruning a plant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Ieke"&gt;The resulting text is esoteric and obscure, discussing everything from the roots of language itself to the concept of “hyper-dimensionality.” It is also brilliant and illuminating, showing how writing &lt;em&gt;alongside&lt;/em&gt; machines can shape thought and expression. At different points, Allado-McDowell compares the experience of writing using GPT-3 to taking mushrooms and communing with gods. They write: “A deity that rules communication is an incorporeal linguistic power. A modern conception of such might read: a force of language from outside of materiality.” That force, Allado-McDowell suggests, might well be a useful way to think about artificial intelligence. The result of communing with it is a sort of “emergence,” they told me, an experience of “being part of a larger ecosystem than just the individual human or the machine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="aEsaw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for us&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhNBsz"&gt;This, I think, is why AI writing is so much more exciting than many other applications of artificial intelligence: because it offers the chance for communication and collaboration. The urge to speak to something greater than ourselves is evident in how these programs are being embraced by early adopters. A &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/jessica-simulation-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;number&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://believermag.com/ghosts/"&gt;individuals&lt;/a&gt; have used GPT-3 to talk to dead loved ones, for example, turning its statistical intelligence into an algorithmic ouija board. Though such experiments also reveal the limitations. In one of these cases, OpenAI &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2021/jessica-simulation-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;shut down a chatbot&lt;/a&gt; shaped to resemble a developer’s dead fiancée because the program didn’t conform to the company’s terms of service. That’s another, less promising reality of these systems: the vast majority are owned and operated by corporations with their own interests, and they will shape their programs (and, in turn, their users) as they see fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="W1k8Tt"&gt;Despite this, I’m hopeful, or at least curious, about the future of AI writing. It will be a conversation with our machines; one that is diffuse and subtle, taking place across multiple platforms, where AI programs linger on the fringes of language. These programs will be unseen editors to news stories and blog posts, they will suggest comments in emails and documents, and they will be interlocutors that we even talk to directly. It’s impossible that this exchange will only be good for us, and that the deployment of these systems won’t come without problems and challenges. But it will, at least, be a dialogue. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta’s Andrew Bosworth on moving Facebook to the metaverse</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The magnitude of technological shifts that we are trying to manifest here hasn’t been attempted in a long time’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cYAejy"&gt;Last week, Facebook announced a major corporate rebrand by changing its company name to Meta. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new name is meant to solidify the social media giant’s long-term bet on building the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgA7cm"&gt;Leading that work directly is Andrew Bosworth, a 15-year-veteran of Facebook who leads its Reality Labs division building consumer hardware and software, including the Quest VR headset. His organization has over 10,000 employees and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;spending at least $10 billion this year alone&lt;/a&gt;. Before Reality Labs, he led the division building Facebook’s advertising business and co-invented staple features like the News Feed and Groups. Next year, he will become the chief technology officer of Meta, expanding his remit to include the company’s artificial intelligence and broader engineering teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKlJMl"&gt;Bosworth (who goes by “Boz”) talked with senior reporter Alex Heath about Facebook’s rebrand to Meta, how content moderation will work in the metaverse, and the hardware journey from virtual to mixed reality and, eventually, AR glasses. Bosworth also touched on the controversy surrounding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;the Facebook Papers&lt;/a&gt;, a trove of internal documents leaked by an ex-employee named Frances Haugen, that he argues “don’t tell a particularly objective story.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1xb3Wv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cysuRW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Andrew Bosworth, you are the VP of reality labs at Meta and soon-to-be CTO of Meta, welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJtP7F"&gt;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZ41a6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrQgCF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to get into everything you guys just announced at Connect: a big new corporate rebrand focused on the metaverse. But first, I have to know, what were the other name options? Because over the last week, I’m sure you’ve seen, there have been a lot of guesses. I personally would’ve loved the Washington Football Team, but I was really curious if you could just give a short list of what were the options?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gu921u"&gt;This is probably someone else’s story to tell more than mine, especially Alex Schultz, who [was] pretty masterful, at the scale that this company operates, to have this held out as long as we did was, I think, pretty spectacular. Obviously, one of the names you see us investing a lot in is Horizon. And at some point you had to make a choice of, well, you want the entire company to be a metaverse company but you also want to have a product within that. So we talked about Worlds and Rooms and Home as kind of these three pillars of what Horizon is. So that was one of the ones that we were discussing. I know you took a shot in the dark on that one. It was a near miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHqUxY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7itOoI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735612/facebook-change-company-name-metaverse"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;spoiled a little bit of your all’s surprise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zlike"&gt;It was a good scoop, man.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;We don’t know how you did it. Don’t tell me. I don’t like having the surprise ruined for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vt5BAq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpjK3m"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I thought it might be Horizon. Meta was the other one on the short list.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yhxoah"&gt;You sent me a DM and you’re like, “It better not just be Meta.” I just didn’t respond. Reporters troll me all the time for information and you just can’t respond. I didn’t respond. And then today, the moment it was announced, the first thing I did was reply to that response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tAZ6J"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2mmKp5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, you did. And I should say you mentioned Alex Schultz earlier. For people who don’t know, that’s Facebook’s CMO [chief marketing officer], one of your—&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsn0Aw"&gt;Meta’s CMO, even.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEqQK4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RHscy4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s right, Meta’s CMO. This is going to be the whole podcast. Alex is a longtime colleague of yours. So you oversee a very large part of Meta now, and it’s going to get bigger when you become CTO [chief technology officer] next year. I’d love to get into all that. First, for the audience, I’d love for you to just quickly walk through your background, what you worked on before this, and how you got to be in this role?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JssBKm"&gt;I have a really wide-ranging background at Facebook. I’ve been at Facebook a long time. As an undergraduate, I studied artificial intelligence. I had a brief stint at Microsoft, actually, which was great, it taught me a lot about professional software development and management, but joined Facebook relatively early in my career. The first thing I did out of the gate, and what a great assignment, working with Chris Cox and Ruchi Sanghvi, was the News Feed. And I built all the AI, the ranking, and we built the first, as far as I know, the first ranked content feed, and I built all the rank and the AI behind it, Chris built the front end, and Ruchi was the PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TDTYn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lQbTe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to just stop here for a second. I don’t think people understand how early you were at Facebook. Do you have a sense of how many people there are that have been there longer than you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IefR1P"&gt;I think now five or six that have been there longer than me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jxvxb8"&gt;When I joined there were probably 15 of us, 15 engineers at the company. And a few of us are still here. Obviously, Zuck [Mark Zuckerberg], Naomi [Gleit], some of the big names. Chris Cox, I think we’re going to count it, he beat me by a month, although he did leave for a year. So we’re not entirely clear if that resets the clock or how it works. It was early and we were just a website for college kids. I remember when we were building the News Feed in January 2006, I asked Mark, “What’s the scale?” He was like, “Well, we just hit our 5 million user mark, build it for 10 million. That’ll take us a long time to get to.” Of course, by the time we launched six months later we’d blown past 10 million users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="WQ4vjX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsHLZ9"&gt;It was a crazy journey. I really worked across all of our product. Back then, it was really homogenous. You worked on the entire product. You worked on photos and wall and profiles and all these things together. And then I had a big stint running communication stuff. So, Messenger is one of the teams that I was leading when we created Messenger. And Groups, I’m really proud of that one. It was a small team that I was leading that created what is now one of our, I think, great contributions, is Facebook Groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDNepY"&gt;I worked on a lot of the teams there in the interim, privacy and infrastructure and site speed and these things, to mobile ads. And then ultimately to ads. And I ran the ads business from 2013, I suppose, until 2017, which was a dramatic period of growth for us. It was a fun time to be working on that product. And then, yeah, now the last four years, I’ve been working on, first, it was called AR / VR, then Facebook Reality Labs and now just Reality Labs, which is a part of Meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUeIWe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNGjZ5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gosh, so many name changes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCNrLX"&gt;I’m like Daniel-san in &lt;em&gt;The Karate Kid&lt;/em&gt;. I spent a lot of time painting the fence, spent a lot of time waxing the car. And now I’m, maybe, equipped to do the job that I’m in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mek5fT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5Bm6s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So now you have this org that is over 10,000 people now. Mark said on the last earnings call, you guys are going to spend at least $10 billion this year alone on the metaverse, on building all this stuff that you directly oversee. When you think back to being that early, being one of the first 15 engineers or so, did you ever think you’d be overseeing a team and a budget that large? I don’t think anyone really expected that Facebook would eventually be spending this much on this stuff.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evjP5z"&gt;No, I didn’t have a concept of that. I don’t think anyone can ever really have a concept of what it means to have a team that numbers so many phenomenally talented people who could get a job anywhere. They choose to work with us. We’re grateful for that. And the amount of money is hard to fathom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oj9TvT"&gt;To some degree, I think all of us as just a species, we’re a little bit innumerate as it relates to big numbers. Big tech numbers we think of as being big, big dollars. And those pale in comparison to the government, but they’re certainly bigger than anything that we deal with in our day-to-day lives. And so, I do think this is one of the pieces for me that maybe I feel like we’re at a privileged point in history, because the magnitude of technological shift that we are trying to manifest here hasn’t been attempted in a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZZA8B"&gt;I think certainly the creation of the internet in the late ’80s, early ’90s, mid-90s, was one of them. I think if you go back to Xerox PARC and the work they did on the Alto, that’s probably one of them. Obviously, Bell Labs and the transistor, that’s one of them. There are these really epic moments where a technology is pioneered and advanced well in advance of us really having a fully detailed understanding of all the ways that it’s going to affect us and do things. And I get to be a part of that. I get to be a part of that history. It’s not happening just at one company, it’s happening in the entire industry right now. And it’s, yeah, it’s daunting. It’s terrifying. But it’s obviously also a tremendous honor and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWE0iP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjCVsN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to acknowledge the moment we’re in too, with this rebrand for Facebook and now Meta. You all are no stranger to scrutiny. I think it’s probably safe to say you might be the most scrutinized company in the world right now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VbaRtz"&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnSfSO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4Ux67"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s probably safe to say. There’s been these Facebook Papers the last few weeks. There’s already these conspiracy theories that you guys did this rebrand at this time to try to change the narrative. I know that’s not the case. I interviewed your boss, Mark [Zuckerberg], and he told me this started over six months ago, actually.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vAPBU"&gt;I mean, if we wanted to do that, we would have not done it this way. If that was the goal, then we would have taken a very different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFBCPk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0y74c2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But acknowledging the moment we’re in, I mean, what do you say to the people who say this is a change to distance the brand tax that exists with the Facebook name now, for certain people and for lawmakers and the press, from everything else you all are doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4HSVG"&gt;Yeah, it’s not that. I mean, everything that we do is centered around consumers and consumer expectations. So we really were starting to hit these unusual spots. I’ll give you an example. So we had Oculus accounts. And part of the problem with Oculus accounts was that people really weren’t building up any kind of network to connect with. And what we do know is that when people have a network, they have more fun. For the same amount of time spent in the headset, they enjoy it more. That’s what they tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMgxXF"&gt;And so we went to pretty elaborate extents to try to get, “Okay, let’s use the Facebook network in Oculus.” It’s an odd fit. It was an odd fit. And now Mark has announced that we’re going to change the way that we do accounts in Oculus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlu2uH"&gt;So we’re trying to solve a problem and the only solution available to us isn’t a great solution. This kind of thing was happening all over the place. Facebook is a product. Having it try to also be an umbrella brand, which we tried, obviously, for the last several years, was really a struggle for us. It was really a struggle for consumers. I don’t think consumers really had a strong mental model of how that works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztHiFW"&gt;If you ask consumers about Instagram and WhatsApp, and do you want to link these things or not link them, they understand what that means because those are products that they can have a sense of. And so I think we want to be able to have things like accounts that are at the Meta level,  but still give consumers a really strong understanding of how products relate to the data that they’re giving up, who they’re connecting to, what value they’re getting in exchange for all of that, make sure they feel good about it. So I think all these things are very consumer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zLqNd"&gt;That’s a very practical reason to do it. The second part of it, for me, is — I know that it’s cheesy. No one wants to just run with the story we’re telling. But it’s the real damn story. It’s an exciting vision of what comes next. To some degree, we have hit the natural saturation point with mobile phones, with the mobile internet, with social networks. They kind of are what they’re going to be. There’s a lot of them, it’s very competitive, but they’re competitive on the margins. But we’re not seeing big steps forward and totally new things as much anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0sxwSf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we have a new unfulfilled vision that I think can power us for, let’s say, the next 15 or 20 years.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e0yZ7n"&gt;And I think the metaverse feels like something that doesn’t exist today, and you can’t do it any other way. It’s in pockets, there’s little glimpses of it. And I think we’re excited about that. But the things that we’re describing are mostly just not possible without tremendous investment. And so I think for us, the corporate umbrella of Facebook served us so well for such a long time, because it was itself an unfulfilled vision. There’s still a lot of work to do there, obviously, but now we have a new unfulfilled vision that I think can power us for, let’s say, the next 15 or 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uudktl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqBdG7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As you guys are doing all this and trying to lean into the future and trying to position the company that way, do you feel under siege at all, from the outside, in terms of the barrage of what is hitting you all? Is it distracting? Are you having to constantly tell people, “Look, we need to focus on what we’re trying to build.” Because people’s families are asking about these Facebook Papers, or what have you? How do you navigate that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCnqGI"&gt;Yeah, I think it really depends on what your job is and where you are. Obviously, I think the comms team is pretty busy these days. I think for people who work in the fields that are under discussion, if you’re in research or in integrity, it’s hard because we don’t think these tell a particularly objective story. These weren’t random documents. These were specifically selected documents. They’re curated. There’s a selection bias that went into the documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXr9AM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Qx6Jp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I was selfishly disappointed there was nothing from Reality Labs in the document dump.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXh2Qx"&gt;Oh yeah. You can imagine my disappointment. Not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChJt7i"&gt;I think it depends on where you work. I think for those teams who are having their work maybe mischaracterized or misunderstood, I think that’s a challenge that they’re going through, the personal struggle. And obviously that’s part of it. But for a lot of people, yeah, they’re able to stay pretty heads-down I think. My team, we talk about it. We have a very frank discussion about, “Hey, here’s what’s out there. Here’s the reality as we see it. Here’s what you can do to follow up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phKxy9"&gt;And I think people are pretty satisfied with that. They’ve got the ability to talk to their friends and family and they can point them to the posts that Mark has made and say, “Hey, here’s the post, here’s the thing,” if you’re asking the questions. But it affects everyone differently. And a lot really does vary by the team and the role that that people play. So it’s not a uniform thing. We’re such a big company, nothing’s really going to affect us in a uniform way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dI0G7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2tBAD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As part of this you guys are also getting rid of the Oculus name. I saw you announced that shortly after Connect, and you are replacing it with Meta. Portal, which is your video chat device for the home. It’s going to be called Meta Portal, Meta Horizon. Particularly with Oculus, which I think is probably the more established thing you guys have for VR, why do that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QA5D99"&gt;It’s established and it’s beloved, both internally and externally. So this is kind of a heartbreaker. At some point, and again, the center is always on the consumers, and at some point, you want to have consumers have tremendous clarity about what is the company that’s providing this product. And then what are the services on that product and what can they use. And you just can’t have so many brands. We all get out there on the internet and make jokes about companies that have eight or 10 brand names in a row for everything they do. But then when it’s our brands, like, “Oh no, no. Don’t, that one, we love that one. That one’s a special one for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rflUh"&gt;So to some degree you have to walk the walk and say, “Hey, I love the Oculus brand.” And I’m sad that we are moving away from it. I’m going to miss it. The community is going to miss it. It’s funny. That was the number one reaction in my Twitter and Instagram mentions was just sadness. There was a real turning point for virtual reality at Oculus. But we want to make sure that we have a very good clarity with consumers. This is a Meta product, so that they understand what that is and build the equity there in their minds. So yeah, we had to move in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tgz0Rx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyXhxg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So in the future, I’m going to have a Meta account, and I can choose to log into my Meta Quest with that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vchMC"&gt;We don’t have all the details, and I don’t mean we’re not sharing the details. I mean, we don’t have all the details yet on the direction we’re going to go. I think it was important for Mark to signal that as part of this change we are recognizing that it was a mistake to go bundle Facebook accounts with the Oculus Quest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0bugkv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBhffo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You got a lot of blowback when you did that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecixOL"&gt;Yeah. And again, it all came from a good place. Like I said, we had a vision. We knew something was going to be very pro-consumer on the other side of it. And it hasn’t been a factor for sales or engagement or things that indicate to us that people care about the product and are enjoying it and using it. But In the community that we love, our enthusiast community, that was a controversial change. And some parts of it have played out as we’d hoped they would. People are spending more time being more social. But some parts have played out in a different way. And so it’s been a little bit confusing and we just, we never want to have any confusion. My number one responsible innovation principle that we work with is “Never surprise people.” That’s number one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5Waod"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJ4tZb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And the Facebook thing surprised people. I mean, when you guys rolled it out. It did.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYk9xe"&gt;But I mean in the product, I mean in people’s expectations of a product that they’re using as consumers. And so, yeah, for me, that’s where we start and finish in this thing. So for the account stuff, we don’t have ... It’s not all settled how it’s going to be structured or how it’s going to be named or anything like that. Since this became clear to us, we’ve been working on this name change for six months. Since that moment, we started working internally on, “Okay, if we’re doing that, then the account system also can change finally.” We can actually accomplish our goals and not force the bundling. So we think it’s going to be really good for consumers, obviously more details as we have them. And so we’re well underway on the work there, but a lot of the consumer-facing work, what it’s going to be called and how people are going to access and relate to it, is to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sXDSLU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkVjgf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This whole metaverse concept, I talked a lot with Mark about this. We can keep it pretty high-level. The idea is this immersive, embodied internet that is 3D. You could think of today like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; or &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, where people are hanging out as avatars. And you guys are wanting to build this in AR and VR. I’m curious about how you take the concepts that we know today, a lot of them that you helped invent at Facebook and social media, and translate that to the metaverse. Is there going to be a News Feed in Horizon, which is this metaverse platform, software platform, you’re building? How are you thinking about the ways people engage with content in the metaverse?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdBh3j"&gt;I don’t think there will be a literal News Feed, except there might be your actual News Feed from Facebook. There’s no reason that 2D interfaces aren’t going to be an important part of an immersive metaverse in the same way that they’re an important part of how we navigate the physical world. But yeah, of course. There’s going to be so much to do. And in some ways, if you think about when you go to a city, there’s so much to do in a new city. How do you figure out what you want to do? There’s entire services, entire industries designed to help you navigate the amount that there is to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="L6Q0mO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t think there will be a literal News Feed, except there might be your actual News Feed from Facebook.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0yiFsq"&gt;There’s going to be way more to do in the metaverse, especially when you can instantaneously travel to any of the many cities that we kind of imagine ultimately populating the place. You’ll definitely need to have services that help you with what’s new, what’s hot, what’s trending, and what’s going on. What are other people doing? What are your friends doing? How can you plan things? Can you schedule things? So all those services are going to exist and we’re super excited about them. But I do think that it’s a little bit cart before the horse. Before I can figure out how I need to rank content for you, I need to have content for you. That’s just the sequencing that has to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moQCvC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuIFnw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you think about Facebook, how it allows one-to-many broadcasting, someone can instantly reach millions of people fueled by algorithms. Do you think that kind of value will translate to Horizon? For example, do I need to be the friend of someone or a friend of a friend before I can even interact with them in Horizon? Are you thinking about making it kind of more of a closed social graph, or is that still to be determined?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03JIJ0"&gt;It’s still to be determined, but you’ve struck on something very interesting. There will be use for these asynchronous modalities that we’ve developed for the web and for the phone. And some will be 2D and some will be 3D and that’s going to be great. And there’s lots of things that you can do in the metaverse by yourself as experiences and that’s going to be great. But a lot of it is going to be quite new because I think the metaverse is largely a synchronous experience. You’re there with people in real time having an experience in real time. There’s something meaningful about it. That’s a trait that it possesses that is actually hard to get at in the internet that we have on mobile phones and on the web. You get touches of it. Look, here we are doing a podcast. That’s a cool synchronous thing. And people do video calls. They don’t love it. It’s not great, but we do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmi6sm"&gt;But for social, for fun, it’s not generally the way that we have these shared experiences today. So I do think that a lot of things are going to be different. A lot of the ideas that we’ve had to pioneer on the web won’t translate, and you have to completely rethink them. Some of them, it’s nice because you’ll be able to deploy metaphors from the real world, the physical world. That’s great. Some of them will be completely novel because there isn’t an analog in the physical world and that will require real invention. And then to your question about the friends thing, yeah, because it’s a synchronous environment, I think how we as a society want to think about integrity, privacy, is an open question. The stronger the integrity and privacy guarantees I want to make, the weaker the interoperability is going to be. And we know, that’s a tough tradeoff that we have to balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz94Pf"&gt;And likewise, if we make really strong privacy guarantees, that could trade off directly against integrity. So if there’s a private conversation and we’re not able to hear it, how do we manage the situation? One of the things that we do know we’re going to do, which I’m enthusiastic about, is give every individual who comes to the metaverse the tools to control their own experience. So absolutely, the idea of being like, hey, I’m only going to be visible [to], and only visible to me will be people who are within certain spheres. Or here’s a person who I don’t like, I mute them. They now don’t exist. And unlike on the internet where there’s kind of just an endless stream of accounts, that’s not how it is in a physical environment. There’s a real cost with switching accounts. And so I think there are some advantages that the synchronous environment is going to have in terms of an individual being able to feel in control of themselves and their experience and feel safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fI2WN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSMJhr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talked a little bit about crypto and NFTs at Connect. It was the first time I’ve really heard Mark even say the word NFT publicly. I’m curious what you think of the promise of smart contracts, blockchain technology — I’m thinking of DAOs, decentralized autonomous organizations — can do in the metaverse, in an embodied internet where I’m an avatar with a bunch of people in an asynchronous environment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ectTJ"&gt;When you think about interoperability, entitlements, as we would call it in the game industry, is an important concept. Like who owns this thing and what rights do they have to it? Can they make copies of it? Can they sell it? Can they take it with them into every single location? What locations can they take it into? And that’s not hard to do with the database if the entire metaverse is controlled by one company, which we don’t want it to be. And we don’t think it can be. It’s not necessarily hard to do with a database if we have a really good standardized schema and you can pick which database it’s in and it goes here and there and everyone kind of has access to that. But another way to do it, that could be really strong, is NFTs and crypto, where you’ve got the ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gF2d40"&gt;Instead of having to store it in a database somewhere, which has its own downsides, you store it in the blockchain. And there’s an ability to say, yep, the system can verify that I’m the owner of this object and I have the right to make copies of it, or to sell copies, or whatever the thing is. So there’s an opportunity there. I think you know this, that space is very exciting and moving very quickly. The fundamental technologies are definitely one of the things that could be useful here. And I’d be very surprised if they weren’t one of the things undergirding at least part of it. I’m not sure that every part of the metaverse is going to be underpinned by crypto. But I think it’s important to support it. And especially given the amount of entrepreneurial energy in that space right now, this really is about creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95GlhI"&gt;The macro trend on the internet will carry us forward into the metaverse, I believe, which is just that creators, the creator economy that includes everything from developers and performers and people who are providing services. I think there’s going to be people who are doing interior decorating in the metaverse. They’re going to be decorating your home for you. There are going to be people who are stylists. You can get your avatar looking fresh. There’s going to be services. And so the creator economy is really the thing that will be the biggest thing to unlock. And I think there’s going to be concern from creators if the platform doesn’t provide them the degree of flexibility and control that they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfOsWt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ceq4y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is getting at how maximalist and expansive this idea is, because I think when people think of the metaverse and Facebook, they think of a 3D version of Facebook and the Meta headset. What you’re talking about, especially using blockchain potentially, is taking it from one environment to the other. Say I want to move from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to Horizon. They’re both in VR. I want to take my avatar and all my virtual goods with me. Still, I’m very skeptical that you guys are going to figure that out with all the competitors in the industry. Maybe once this becomes just so realized that people have to do it because consumers are demanding it, then maybe. But building up to that, Apple, for example, they’re doing mixed reality. They’re going to have a headset. They’re going to have glasses. I think there’s zero chance they work with you all on interoperability in any kind of a virtual world. Maybe you disagree, but that’s the largest company in the world as an example. So how do you get people to actually buy into this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PItEoz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we can empower creators to have a richer economy, that creates a flywheel where more digital creation happens.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3Bopo"&gt;There are a lot of levels here. I certainly think that you’re right. Just as the internet itself went through a lot of revisions and protocols that were designed but never adopted, and then these ones were adopted and different things happened. I expect the same to happen around the metaverse. And the majority of these questions are hard and they’re still ahead of us. Having said that, I don’t think we’re as far apart from most of the people in the industry as you might think. I think we all generally get a sense that if we can empower creators to have a richer economy, that creates a flywheel where more digital creation happens; that’s really good for consumers and that grows the economy, that grows the pie. We all benefit. One of the obvious things that you can do to increase the value that you’re giving to your developers, your creators — I’ve heard &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve heard Epic, I’ve heard a lot of people talk about this — is getting them a larger audience. That’s an easy one. It costs you nothing. They’re developing the same thing and now the audience is larger. So I think the watch word for the metaverse is continuity, being able to have a continuity of experiences across both experiences and platforms built by different companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27IpfK"&gt;And so, yeah, there are areas where this is actually pretty workable. Let’s take avatars. Being able to implement somebody else’s avatar or having to implement your avatar for someone else’s system is actually pretty workable. It’s not an impossible challenge. Does that mean every avatar is going to be useful everywhere? No, of course not. But there are also clothes that I can’t wear in every place that I go in the physical world; that wouldn’t be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOCbxg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TejFf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’d love to know what this is.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAv9Z0"&gt;You know, I wouldn’t wear an Easter bunny costume to church. That seems like a mixed message. And so it’s not unheard of that we would have these cases where’s like, yeah, I can’t take this thing over there because of whatever rules that apply over there. So it’s not totally unheard of even in the physical world. So anyway, I bring this up to say, I agree it’s going to be hard. You’re absolutely right. If there’s a thing to be skeptical of, you nailed it. That’s the hardest part for sure. However, at least at a conversational level, whether I’m talking to people at Microsoft, talking to people at Google, different people, there is a vision that we share, I think, that is coming into focus for the industry. And if we can find really strong standards in a way that allows people to recoup their investments, because this is expensive work, as Mark said, then I think there’s a chance. There’s a path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nkcid0"&gt;There’s a second path, which is the one that often works, which is you get enough consumers in one area. And then you’re able to attract more and more partners into the area to interoperate on that platform because they want to go where the marketplace is. And that’s another path that is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6ZBBj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vSVfi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do want to touch on hardware because you teased a little bit more about two big hardware things. You’ve got Cambria, which is this high-end version of VR. It’s really mixed reality with full-color passthrough that’s coming next year. You’re going to share more about it next year. And then you’ve got Project Aria and Nazare, which are the AR glasses that are farther out. But I guess maybe we could start with Cambria. Is the idea that eventually all this is going to merge together, and so we had VR first, now we’re going to get passthrough experiences where I’m wearing a headset with video feeds looking out, kind of mixing graphics with the real world? And then eventually we get to AR, which is just in my glasses. Is it a continuity like that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aV4di"&gt;Yeah, from a sequencing standpoint you’re right. And you’re certainly right that there’s a nontrivial overlap in the Venn diagram of AR and VR, and we call it mixed reality. But I will point out the use cases are pretty different. If you’re putting on a big headset with a larger field of view that’s more occluded, that is a little bit more immersive, that’s the kind of experience that you might have at your house, at your desk, at your office. It’s not one that you’re going to have out in the street. It’s not one that you’re going to have on the train, walking around. For those experiences, you’re probably going to prefer AR. And the things that you’ll want to do when you’re mobile, moving around throughout your day, turn out to be pretty different than things that you’re doing when you’re sitting in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uPysz"&gt;So I think there is a permanent, lasting place for VR. I think VR in the future will always be augmented with mixed reality. It’s just safer, better for a bunch of things. It’s a good thing. It’s going to be a while before we get there just because right now it’s expensive. You’re adding cameras, adding the cameras themselves is the most expensive thing. But now you have to process all the image data and so that adds to the thermals, that adds to the processing envelope. And so I think, yeah, I think in the future there’s a lasting, permanent place for VR in our lives, in our workflows and the things that we do for fun. And then there’s also AR, which I think creates its own new category. But then of course you’re right, there will be areas that the two overlap at a software level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PEMUZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP4AXa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s Nazare, which is the code name for these AR glasses that are pretty far out. You’ve got Project Aria right now which is doing egocentric data capture with no displays in them. You’re expanding that program now. You’ve been doing it for the last year or so where people are just walking around ID’d as being Facebook contractors and they’re just capturing what they see with sensors on their glasses. And this is to help you train how AR glasses will work in the real world, because it’s an entirely new point of view for compute. Could you talk a little bit about how that’s going? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFV50S"&gt;I think there’s two pieces here. One of which is the egocentric data that we’re capturing with Aria and using the training, yeah, there’s a lot of security in addition. We’re blurring faces and blurring license plates. The data’s not user-accessible to the person recording it, so on and so forth, just for your listeners who are worried. We’ve got a whole open program on that. The details are all available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WQTlO"&gt;And that’s really critical because so much of what you want to do in augmented reality is contextual. You want it to have a sense of what you’re up to, what you’re doing. So when somebody walks up to me and they’re having a conversation, I need to  get all the UI out of my face so that I can see their face and they can see my eyes, and that’s really good. But maybe there is something that the system could know is so important that it needs to interrupt me for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OdgrQh"&gt;And so the more context that this thing has in understanding the physical world around me as well as the digital artifacts it’s managing, the better it’s going to serve me. Because again, the goal of this is to be both more present and more connected. So it doesn’t really buy us much, in the mission of Facebook at least, if you put these things in your glasses and now you’re just constantly on your phone, but it’s your glasses. That’s not exciting. That’s not the goal. The goal is to have it so that the information that’s relevant to you is there and accessible when you need it. And then it’s not there when it would otherwise be in the way or distracting you from a moment that you’re experiencing in your actual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBavLW"&gt;That’s a high bar. We’re talking about a completely novel interaction design between people and machines that we haven’t had before. So I think for me, what we’re going to do is really focus on the AI research that comes out of the Aria dataset. And it’s a huge partnership with Facebook’s absolutely world-class AI team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yU0PtR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHo4ED"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DK5Vs1"&gt;To be fair, I think right now it is still the Facebook AI team, but you’re right. We probably got to chase that one down, all the way down. I gotta say, we changed the sign in front of the building today. We did a pretty good job of getting this thing out in one day without it leaking. I’m pretty pleased about that. There is going to be a six-month adjustment period here as we work through all the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG97bU"&gt;And so anyway, for me the interaction paradigm is so novel it’s going to need a level of intelligent and contextual understanding, and you want to run as much as you can locally on the device. Not only is that the privacy-friendly way to do it, it’s also the thing that is probably required because you’d be otherwise sending so much data back, and data is expensive to transfer. Wireless radios are expensive to operate. We’d like to not operate them. We’d like to do as much of this locally as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFBWLL"&gt;And so getting these models built that we can then miniaturize into silicon, possibly custom silicon, and then run locally on the device so that you can have this contextual awareness, this user interface that reacts really intuitively to what you’re trying to accomplish. That’s the North Star vision that we have and I think it’s exciting and it’s as hard a thing as anything else in here. We talk about these hard technical problems, but the user interaction design challenges are as hard as anything. There’s no keyboard, there’s no mouse, there’s no touchscreen. Direct manipulation is out. So what are we doing to try to replace it? What are we doing to make it so it’s not as required?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jqoPl1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhbQVO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We don’t have time to talk about the CTRL-Labs stuff [neural interfaces] because you’re right, there is so much that you are working on. Lastly, do you still think AR glasses are three years or so out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTxf4J"&gt;We definitely hope to be playing with prototypes in the next couple of years. And this is one of the things that confounds the press and nobody believes me, it’s really true. You don’t decide, here’s the thing, I’m going to ship it at this point. You decide, here’s the thing, I’m going to build it and while I’m playing with it I will decide whether that’s a shippable thing or not a shippable thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSx4IL"&gt;It’s so funny. I posted these pictures of me and Mark in various prototypes, and those are research prototypes. Those weren’t even production prototypes. One was an industrial design prototype. It had no mechanics, no electronics in it. One was just for testing the boundaries of resolution. They’re prototypes. And people were like, “What is the product?” And it’s like no, you don’t understand. We just have headsets laying about the place covered in all kinds of gear to try out things. And then they converge relatively late, surprisingly late, I think, to the layperson. Whether we decide okay, that is a product that we have. We’re definitely going to be playing with some really good ... We have early, early, early prototypes right now of course, but we’re going to be playing with more robust prototypes in the next year, hopefully. Maybe two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqCtBl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEai8R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right, Boz. I’m going to let you get back to your giant mound of prototypes. Maybe you could tweet some more teasers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="OaOARN"&gt;I’ll do what I can, absolutely. Thanks, Alex.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wkl54aoYirPvm0SYU_6vTqPjDE8=/0x321:1080x1041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073871/VRG_ILLO_4850_10_Year_speech.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;What comes after deplatforming?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eH4p9u"&gt;It’s a strange fact of history that critics began calling on Twitter to ban Donald Trump shortly after he was elected president and got what they wanted a few days before the end of his term. For four years, we talked about a ban — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/24/14561306/ban-donald-trump-twitter"&gt;why it was necessary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitter-ban-donald-trump/"&gt;why it was impossible&lt;/a&gt;; how refusing &lt;a href="https://www.cjr.org/analysis/donald-trump-twitter-ban.php"&gt;showed that platforms were principled&lt;/a&gt;, how it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/827952743633424384?lang=en"&gt;showed they were hypocrites&lt;/a&gt; — and just when there was nothing left to say, it happened. There were detailed justifications for the ban when it came (it was a state of emergency, the best among bad options, and so on), but the timing suggests a simpler logic. As long as Trump was president, platforms couldn’t punish him. Once he’d lost the election, he was fair game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXxr5Z"&gt;Twitter’s decision to ban Trump had a cascading effect: Facebook issued its own ban, then YouTube, then everyone else. The Trump-friendly social network Parler came under scrutiny, and the platform’s host, Amazon Web Services, took a closer look at the violent threats that had spread on Parler in advance of the Capitol riot, ultimately deciding to drop the network entirely. Trump boasted about starting his own social network only to offer a short-lived series of online press releases. Journalists who shared the releases too eagerly were shamed for helping the disgraced president evade the ban, and social pressures made the screenshots less common. Soon, even Facebook ads showing Trump speeches drew criticism as a potential evasion of the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7mFCCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard not to be anxious about whether platforms can keep it up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpM1ao"&gt;The months since have perfectly illustrated the effectiveness of deplatforming. Once inescapable, the former president has all but disappeared from the daily discourse. He continues to hold rallies and make statements, but the only way to hear about them is to go to a rally in person or tune into fringe networks like OANN or NewsMax. Before the ban, there was real doubt about whether deplatforming a major political figure could work. After the ban, it is undeniable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTq5OK"&gt;For the most part, platforms have avoided meaningful blowback for the decision, although there’s been growing angst about it from the American right wing. If they can do this to Trump, the thinking goes, they can do it to anyone. It’s entirely true. This is the dream of equal justice under the law: anyone who commits murder should be worried that they’ll go to jail for it. There should be no one so powerful that they can’t be kicked out of a restaurant if they start spitting in other people’s food. In this one difficult case, Twitter was able to live up to the ideal of equal justice. But as we look to the next 10 years of speech moderation, it’s hard not to be anxious about whether platforms can keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="s4yyUq"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nGayrL"&gt;We tend to talk about moderation politics as something that happens between platforms and users (i.e., who gets banned and why), but the Trump debacle shows there’s another side. Like all companies, social platforms have to worry about the politics of the countries they operate in. If companies end up on the wrong side of those politics, they could face regulatory blowback or get ejected from the country entirely. But moderation is politically toxic: it never makes friends, only enemies, even as it profoundly influences the political conversation. Increasingly, platforms are arranging their moderation systems to minimize that political fallout above all else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TuyLI"&gt;The problem is much bigger than just Twitter and Trump. In India, Facebook has spent the last seven years in an increasingly fraught relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, cultivating close ties with the country’s leader while violence against India’s Muslim minority continued to escalate. In Myanmar, a February coup forced Facebook to welcome groups it had previously counted as terrorists and suppress groups that mounted military opposition to the new regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UM4BGX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Given the choice, Zuckerberg chose the easy way out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="09k9Bq"&gt;Not surprisingly, both countries have flirted with an outright ban on Facebook, flexing moderation systems of their own. Modi has spoken openly about a ban, and India has less to lose from a ban than Facebook. The platform would drop 260 million users overnight, and it wouldn’t take long for markets and investors to realize the implications. So when a post pushes the limits of what’s acceptable, Facebook will usually make exceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL5axA"&gt;The starkest example of this dynamic was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/"&gt;revealed by the Facebook Papers in October&lt;/a&gt;. In Vietnam, the company faced growing pressure from the ruling Communist Party to moderate against “anti-state” content — essentially building the repressive values of the regime into its own moderation strategy. But when the issue came to a head, Facebook CEO (and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;Meta CEO&lt;/a&gt;) Mark Zuckerberg personally directed the company to comply, saying it was more important “to ensure our services remain available for millions of people who rely on them every day.” Given the choice of protecting the independence of its moderation system or staying on the government’s good side, Zuckerberg chose the easy way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zssz2f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These are ugly, difficult political shifts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cPOd4e"&gt;There was a time when a country-wide blockade of Facebook would have been unthinkable. Civil society groups like Access Now have spent years trying to establish a norm against internet blackouts, arguing that they provide cover for human rights abuses. But Facebook is so toxic in US politics that it’s hard to imagine a president lobbying foreign countries on its behalf. When Myanmar instituted a temporary block in the wake of the country’s military coup, there were few objections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjy9iL"&gt;These are ugly, difficult political shifts, and Facebook is playing an active role in them, just as much as national institutions like the press or the national guard. Facebook isn’t pretending to be a neutral arbiter anymore, and for all the posturing of Facebook’s Oversight Board — a pseudo-independent body with authority over major moderation decisions — there isn’t any greater noble logic to the platform’s choices. They’re just trying to stay on the right side of the ruling party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8olBhu"&gt;This kind of realpolitik isn’t what deplatformers had in mind. The goal was to push Facebook and the others to take responsibility for their impact on the world. But instead of making Facebook and the other platforms more responsible, it has made them more unapologetic about the political realities. These are just corporations protecting themselves. There’s no longer any reason to pretend otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kcYtO-7bqB8oFvXtKqz2AHYVpvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963898/VRG_ILLO_4846_10Year_Social_Media_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="bupyDi"&gt;We often talk about tech companies as if they’re unprecedented, but the world has grappled with this kind of transnational corporate power before. If you want to stop Coca-Cola or United Fruit Company from killing union leaders, it’s not enough to pass laws in the US. You need an international standard of conduct, reaching beyond nation-specific concepts like probable cause or the first amendment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sL06q"&gt;For decades, a constellation of international activists has been building such a system, a body of voluntary transnational agreements generally referred to as “international human rights law.” The name is misleading in some ways since it’s less of a judicial system than a series of non-binding treaties agreeing to general principles: countries shouldn’t discriminate on the basis of race or gender, they shouldn’t use children as soldiers, they shouldn’t torture people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpqiTx"&gt;The language of the treaties is purposefully vague, and enforcement mostly consists of public shaming. (The 1987 Convention Against Torture didn’t prevent the United States from embracing “enhanced interrogation techniques,” for example.) But you can see the beginnings of an international consensus there, nudging us towards a less oppressive and violent world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z45yzu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We need to be thinking about an international mechanism for holding these companies accountable to a standard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3oGSwG"&gt;For the more thoughtful critics of social media, this is the only system broad enough to truly rein in a company like Facebook. Jillian York, who dwells on the Facebook problem at length in her book &lt;em&gt;Silicon Values&lt;/em&gt;, told me the only long-term fix to the troubles roiling India and the United States would be something on that scale. “We need to be thinking about an international mechanism for holding these companies accountable to a standard,” she told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOe9yN"&gt;Optimists might see the shift towards deplatforming and away from free speech extremism as a step in the right direction. Reddit-style speech libertarianism is very much an American concept, relying on the relatively unusual protections of the First Amendment. But rather than drifting towards an international consensus, York sees platforms as simply cut adrift, doing whatever fits the needs of their employees and users at a given moment. In this dispensation, there are few principles anchoring companies like Facebook and Twitter and few protections if they run astray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNaLXP"&gt;“We’re now in a phase where they’re acting of their own accord,” York says. “I don’t think the current scenario is workable for much longer. I don’t think people will put up with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QNuOP3"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="mQjm4p"&gt;Our best glimpse of the post-deplatforming future has been Facebook’s Oversight Board, which has done its best to square the realities of a platform with some kind of higher speech principles. It’s the kind of notice-and-appeal system that advocates have been asking platforms to adopt for years. Faced with a never-ending stream of hard choices, Facebook put tens of millions of dollars into building a master moderator that everyone can trust. For all the system’s flaws, it’s the best anyone’s been able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQqvmQ"&gt;In practice, most of the Oversight Board rulings trace the line where differences of opinion give way to political violence. Of &lt;a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/"&gt;the 18 decisions from the board so far&lt;/a&gt;, 13 are directly related to racial or sectarian conflicts, whether dealing with Kurdish separatists, anti-Chinese sentiment in Myanmar, or a jokey meme about the Armenian genocide. The specifics of the ruling might be about a particular Russian term for Azerbaijanis, but the potential for mass oppression and genocide looms in the background of each one. Taking on the work of moderating Facebook, the Oversight Board has ended up as the arbiter of how much racism is acceptable in conflicts all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDiePV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We can no longer pretend these opinions are safely cordoned off from the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pCwhPA"&gt;But for all the board’s public deliberations, it hasn’t changed the basic problem of platform politics. Whenever the Oversight Board’s fragile principles for online speech conflict with Facebook’s corporate self-interest, the oversight board loses out. The most egregious example so far is Facebook’s “Crosscheck” system that resulted in leniency high-profile accounts, which the Oversight Board had to find out about from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. But even as the company sidesteps its own panel of experts, Facebook can retreat into platitudes about the free exchange of opinions, as if every choice was being guided by a higher set of principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3GWRq"&gt;We’ve been using “freedom of opinion” to sidestep this mess for a very long time. Jean-Paul Sartre described a version of the same pattern in his 1946 work &lt;em&gt;Anti-Semite and Jew&lt;/em&gt;, writing just after the Allied liberation of Paris. In the opening lines of the essay, he marvels at how often the blood-soaked rhetoric of the Nazis was minimized as simply “antisemitic opinion”:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JujcML"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This word opinion makes us stop and think. It is the word a hostess uses to bring to an end a discussion that threatens to become acrimonious. It suggests that all points of view are equal; it reassures us, for it gives an inoffensive appearance to ideas by reducing them to the level of tastes. All tastes are natural; all opinions are permitted… In the name of freedom of opinion, the anti-semite asserts the right to preach the anti-Jewish crusade everywhere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GoPJLL"&gt;This is the dream that tech companies are only now waking from. Companies like Facebook play the role of the hostess — hoping for discussion that is lively enough to keep us in the room but not so heated that it will damage the furniture. But we can no longer pretend these opinions are safely cordoned off from the world. They are a part of the same power struggles that shape every other political arena. Worse, they are subject to the same dangers. We can only hope that, over the next 10 years, platforms find a better way to grapple with them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pinterest hops on the live shopping trend with Pinterest TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pinterest live shopping" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axSDMdktvedkTHopUDebhOFz4jM=/111x0:1302x794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073748/pinterest_live_shopping.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjHx5D"&gt;Pinterest is diving deeper into the e-commerce game with its upcoming shoppable live series, Pinterest TV, which is set to debut on November 8th. Each episode will star a creator from the platform, airing Monday through Friday at 6PM ET on iOS and Android. Shows will cover different topics every day, ranging from fashion, beauty, home, food, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Flck3p"&gt;On Fridays, episodes turn into a QVC-style shopping show, where viewers can purchase exclusive products from different brands, such as Patagonia, Crown Affair, Allbirds, Outdoor Voices, Mented, and Melody Ehsani, using special discounts. Some Pinterest-exclusive shows are already in the works, like &lt;em&gt;Christian On&lt;/em&gt;, in which fashion designer Christian Siriano will replicate the most popular fashion-related searches on Pinterest. Meanwhile, Monica Suriyage and food creators from Pinterest will help rescue failed holiday dishes in &lt;em&gt;Unfail My&lt;/em&gt;. Other confirmed shows are planned with makeup artist Manny MUA, Olympic athlete Tom Daley, and comedian Robyn Schall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf44bz"&gt;Every episode will be recorded and available to watch via the TV icon in the top-left corner of the Pinterest app. During the show, you’ll be able to ask questions in the chat and interact with hosts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Pinterest live shopping show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hDJpbI0cJDklrCyCbSf2ahTNkh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22969396/pinterest_tv_live_shopping_show.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Pinterest&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="17lT3V"&gt;Aside from Pinterest TV, the platform also notes that it’s debuting a “virtual studio,” in which producers from Pinterest can provide technical support, as well as collaborate with creators to make engaging content. Creators can show off and tag products during their shows, as well as offer exclusive discounts — viewers can then select, view, and purchase the product from the retailer’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kfd74O"&gt;Pinterest first began to wade into creator monetization in July of this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22594636/pinterest-idea-pins-tag-product-brand-shoppable"&gt;introducing shoppable pins&lt;/a&gt; that let creators tag and sell products to earn a cut of the profit. As social media platforms seek more ways to attract influencers and help them make money, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526535/live-shopping-instagram-facebook-amazon-influencers"&gt;live shopping has become a major trend&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon helped boost the movement in July 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=1&amp;amp;imprToken=f0be690c-6662-1cfd-194&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21388290011"&gt;when it added shoppable livestreams&lt;/a&gt; from which influencers can profit. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399858/facebook-shop-app-update-sell-product-instagram"&gt;Facebook and Instagram debuted live shopping experiences&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020 — on top of the Shop pages that both platforms already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="reYZCH"&gt;Pinterest TV is the platform’s answer to live shopping. Since Pinterest is already built around displaying products that users might want, it only makes sense to expand from shoppable pins to engaging live shopping experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to the stonk market</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPyoGrvgO6HXv9D7xEdn9lPdWak=/38x0:1838x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073805/VRG_ILLO_4825_Future_of_Money_Lede.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustrations by Michelle Rohn&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Is finance just another meme?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GncVeG"&gt;In February, a quant fund called Cindicator Capital &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/sentiment-trader-at-quant-hedge-fund-at-cindicator-2410397759/"&gt;posted a job listing&lt;/a&gt; for someone with three years of trading experience — and at least 1,000 karma on r/WallStreetBets. “Important: NO higher education in economics or finance,” the listing said. Most of the time on the job would be spent on Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, finding out what retail traders are up to. Among the job duties listed: “opening six-figures OTM [out-of-the-money] options trades with the firm’s own capital” and “trying your best to prevent our risk management from having a heart attack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2HT9s"&gt;This listing actually made sense. After a few boring years where normal people mostly bought index funds, the pandemic sent a bunch of people who &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-12/barstool-sports-dave-portnoy-is-leading-an-army-of-day-traders"&gt;otherwise would have bet on sports&lt;/a&gt; into the welcoming arms of a new batch of mobile-first trading platforms because, well, there weren’t any sports to bet on. So retail traders bought into stocks — not with the idea of making a long-term investment, but rather with the idea of quick money. More sophisticated traders exploited market inefficiencies. Others just yoloed into the memes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UFYlUG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s more incentive than ever to try to become a finance influencer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Du8Oil"&gt;And then, in January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the retail traders decided to flex&lt;/a&gt;: GameStop was so heavily shorted that the traders figured that if they all jumped in, they would drive the price up. And they did: the price skyrocketed 1,900 percent to $347.51 at the close of trading on January 27th from a close of $17.25 on January 4th. The move was coordinated on r/WallStreetBets, a subreddit with millions of subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvdgbj"&gt;One retail investor making a trade isn’t significant. But the rallying cry of r/WallStreetBets is “Apes together strong!” None of GameStop’s fundamentals changed, but the stock surged anyhow as the retail traders cheered each other on. Much to the joy of the apes, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/melvin-capital-lost-53-in-january-hurt-by-gamestop-and-other-bets-11612103117"&gt;hedge fund Melvin Capital lost 53 percent on its investments&lt;/a&gt; in January, largely due to the efforts of retail traders. Another hedge fund that took big losses on GameStop &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/397bdbe9-f257-4ca6-b600-1756804517b6"&gt;shut down completely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5wH08"&gt;Having demonstrated that they could move markets, the meme traders piled into other stocks: AMC, Bed Bath and Beyond, Nokia, Blackberry. AMC elected to yolo along with the retail investors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465198/amc-meme-stock-popcorn-wsb"&gt;offering them free popcorn&lt;/a&gt; and announcing customers could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;buy sodas and other concessions with Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; by the end of the year. (There was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/nrq8sw/adam_aron_knocked_over_his_camera_on_the_trey/"&gt;also a pantsless Zoom&lt;/a&gt;.) It has staved off bankruptcy, and its stock is up more than 1,600 percent this year, as of the close of market on October 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKpajv"&gt;And with the rise of retail investors has come a new class of investing influencers, of whom Elon Musk is the most influential. There’s more incentive than ever to try to become a finance influencer now that there’s a huge retail audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2EAyY"&gt;Welcome to internet finance. It’s only going to get weirder from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="froXs9"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8a1Mip"&gt;Before the pandemic, only one or two of the 30 students in Lana Swartz’s classes had any investing experience. After the pandemic, about 40 percent of her students said they’d done investing, says Swartz, an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia. Many of them traded on platforms such as Robinhood, which offer free trades and fractional shares, making investing easier than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsXTvA"&gt;It’s tempting to blame the pandemic for the surge in retail trading, but the pandemic was more like gasoline. The fire had been burning for a while — since the 2008 financial crisis, in fact. And it had fuel before the pandemic, with mobile apps, free trades, out-of-the-money options, easily available information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXUZoo"&gt;Cryptocurrency and increased interest in retail investing happened in parallel, says Jaime Rogozinski, founder of r/WallStreetBets. They share some of the same qualities: online communities, a focus on memes, and a general energy of “let’s make money and have fun.” Cryptocurrency and meme stocks are “two manifestations of the same ethos,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6brTjn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The gambling approach they take is, ‘If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qns7fL"&gt;Take NFTs. They are media that allow users to program &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; in a way that previous media hasn’t, says Ali Yahya, a general partner at Andreeson Horowitz, who invests in cryptocurrency.  “Now it’s possible to bet on memes, or bet on ideas, or bet on artistic trends that people might believe have a future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puJBjD"&gt;Originally, cryptocurrency was finance’s version of counterculture, and Bitcoin, especially, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166096/bitcoin-blockchain-code-currency-money-genesis-block-silk-road-mt-gox"&gt;remains a finance-based method for hating government&lt;/a&gt;. Meme traders are just as contemptuous of the system, even though they’re participating. The crisis in 2008 was the result of big banks gambling with other people’s money. “The gambling approach they take is, ‘If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em,” Rogozinski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzOjDw"&gt;This influx of retail investors is the kind of thing that catches people’s attention, and a lot of new companies are trying to capitalize on them. For &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/you-can-own-a-fraction-of-a-warhol-but-should-you?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;alternative investments&lt;/a&gt; — think real estate, art, racehorses, and sneakers (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-26/a-company-paid-1-8-million-for-yeezy-sneakers-so-you-can-afford-them?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;yes, really&lt;/a&gt;) — there’s &lt;a href="https://www.yieldstreet.com/"&gt;Yieldstreet,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://rares.io/"&gt;Rares&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://myracehorse.com/"&gt;MyRacehorse&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.artopolie.com/"&gt;Artopolie&lt;/a&gt;. For retail investors who are interested in venture capital, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.miventure.com/"&gt;Miventure&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sweaterventures.com/"&gt;Sweater Ventures&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to invest but aren’t experienced and only have a little money to play with, there’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.acorns.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22744728%2Fmoney-fandom-cryptocurrency-retail-trades-stocks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Acorns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htOoG3"&gt;This is maybe the funniest part of financial nihilism. (Or maybe &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;the most nihilistic part&lt;/a&gt; — it’s hard to tell.) Most of the companies I just listed are backed by big-name venture capital firms, as was Robinhood. You can distrust, even hate, Wall Street as much as you want, but that just creates a new market for it to exploit. If a venture firm — or an investment bank, or anyone else — can make money off of investors’ hatred, they’d be silly not to. After all, among the big winners in the GameStock debacle was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/this-hedge-fund-made-700-million-on-gamestop-11612390687"&gt;an investment firm that correctly called the top&lt;/a&gt; based on an Elon Musk tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DT6B82"&gt;“There’s nothing wrong with Wall Street making money &lt;em&gt;too,&lt;/em&gt;” Rogozinski says. “The apes who are gambling and yoloing — they can coexist with high-frequency trading and Warren Buffet.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qEeiBP1gzYwRVbsbasFYAvHpmP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967642/VRG_ILLO_4825_Future_of_Money_Spot_1.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y70ScT"&gt;Who are these retail investors? Conveniently, Robinhood went public this year — thus giving us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574133/robinhood-meme-trades-dogecoin-ipo"&gt;a picture of its users&lt;/a&gt;. About 50 percent of all new retail trading accounts opened in the US from 2016 to 2021 were on Robinhood, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1783879/000162828021013318/robinhoods-1.htm#ib5a32e8afc3b422193a2f2891a49e0c9_842"&gt;the company’s prospectus said&lt;/a&gt;. Almost three-quarters of the assets under Robinhood’s custody come from people aged 18 to 40. Robinhood’s &lt;em&gt;amazing&lt;/em&gt; dodge on gender ratio — they’re welcoming an “increasing proportion of women to our platform,” lmao — suggests that most of these users are male.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrDbd8"&gt;A Robinhood user who’s 38 would have lived through &lt;a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/savings-and-loan-crisis"&gt;the savings and loan crisis&lt;/a&gt; throughout their childhood, the &lt;a href="https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/what-went-wrong-at-worldcom/"&gt;Enron and Worldcom frauds&lt;/a&gt; in high school, and — most significantly — &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis%E2%80%9410-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html"&gt;the 2008 financial crisis&lt;/a&gt; as they entered the workforce. As home prices and the stock market recovered, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-recession-left-millennials-loaded-with-debtand-cynical-11583956727"&gt;Millennials were shut out&lt;/a&gt; because they didn’t have enough money to buy the assets that led the recovery. (An Australian millionaire &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/05/15/dont-mess-with-millennials-avocado-toast-the-internet-fires-back-at-a-millionaire/"&gt;blamed this on avocado toast&lt;/a&gt;.) And while Silicon Valley boomed in the 2010s, that boom was primarily in the private markets that most investors can’t access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzZ2fC"&gt;“My parents bought their house in 1980, and it’s now worth $1.2 million,” says Rogozinski. “But my rent is more expensive than their mortgage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QId2Pm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The conspiracy theory is a useful window into the minds of these investors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOUPyQ"&gt;What about a younger Robinhood user? A 23-year-old member of Gen Z may not remember all the scandals the older Millennial does, but their outlook is, if anything, grimmer. More than 80 percent of Gen Z survey participants said money was a major stress, and about a third of them identified personal debt as their main source of anxiety, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2018/stress-gen-z.pdf"&gt;2018 survey from the American Psychological Association&lt;/a&gt;. Half of the Gen Z respondents 18 and older &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/05/14/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far-2/"&gt;in a Pew survey&lt;/a&gt; reported someone in their household either lost their job or took a pay cut during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofDGSb"&gt;Part of what drove the r/WallStreetBets raid on GameStop was fury at financial institutions, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/markets/2021/02/11/hedge-funds-gamestop-what-are-hedge-funds-best-hedge-funds/4371758001/"&gt;specifically hedge funds&lt;/a&gt;. The GameStop trades didn’t start that way. But when it was clear hedge funds &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; losing money, the vicious joy some investors felt clearly spoke to a pent-up sense of anger from 2008, Rogozinski says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3PEGW"&gt;And when Robinhood halted trading because it fell short of the collateral requirements for the Depository Trust &amp;amp; Clearing Corp, part of the financial plumbing that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-06/robinhood-s-collateral-crunch-explanation-puzzles-wall-street?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;most retail investors&lt;/a&gt; don’t see, users were furious. A conspiracy theory arose that major financial players had deliberately shut them down because they’d become too powerful. (Never mind that the GameStop rally made &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-27/reddit-day-trader-army-fattens-fortunes-of-world-s-super-rich"&gt;some ultra-rich people richer&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TiJH3"&gt;The conspiracy theory is a useful window into the minds of these investors. They believe Wall Street has stacked the deck against them. They’re angry, and they feel powerful when they can take a hedge fund down a peg. And they’ve also discovered there’s power in numbers. While &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696"&gt;Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill&lt;/a&gt; was the face of these traders, he wasn’t exactly an average investor; he’s a chartered financial analyst who was employed by MassMutual as the director of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;financial wellness education&lt;/a&gt;. And he’s famous for his YouTube videos and financial analysis that boosted his bet on GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jurJul"&gt;Gill isn’t going to be the last person employed in a finance-industry job who yolos his way into being an influencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="e1tXpo"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="fvJiXo"&gt;Arguably the biggest influencer in finance is none other than Elon Musk, who, for years, has been rallying the faithful to Tesla stock through his Twitter account (with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/27/17911428/sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-tesla-funding-tweet"&gt;the occasional go-private whoopsie&lt;/a&gt;) along the way. Musk has endorsed both the GameStonk fever dream and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;Dogecoin,&lt;/a&gt; as well as — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587390/spacex-tesla-bitcoin-musk-dorsey-ethereum-dogecoin"&gt;somewhat more conditionally&lt;/a&gt; — Bitcoin. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/04/bitcoin-falls-after-elon-musk-tweets-breakup-meme.html"&gt;Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;’s price &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;frequently responds&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451900/elon-musk-bitcoin-miners-council-sustainability"&gt;Musk’s tweets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlkN3Z"&gt;There’s an entire world of personalities beyond Musk and Gill, though. r/WallStreetBets is somewhat more narrowly focused than it was before the GameStonk event, but even it has competition. (In his newsletter, Ranjan Roy &lt;a href="https://www.readmargins.com/p/memestocks-and-reddit-redesigns"&gt;makes a compelling argument&lt;/a&gt; that Reddit’s UX design tweaks contributed to retail investor behavior changes.) Any platform you name has investing influencers, such as &lt;a href="https://www.instyle.com/reviews-coverage/ladies-first-podcast-laura-brown/episode-17-mrs-dow-jones-budget-tips"&gt;Mrs. Dow Jones&lt;/a&gt; on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. Younger investors can &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiktok-financial-advice-11619822409"&gt;tune into TikTok for trading tips&lt;/a&gt;, or follow &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thestockguy"&gt;The Stock Guy on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc1RnN"&gt;The chaotic behavior — buying a stock for fun or because someone who you know through social media has endorsed it — is not quite what economic theories predict; most are built on maximizing utility and happiness, says Joshua White, an assistant professor of finance and former financial economist for the SEC. “A big component of investing for retail is excitement and the joy of taking risks,” he says. People might trade to feel like they’re part of a movement or because they really like a specific financial influencer. “With social media platforms and the ability to reach people in an instant, I don’t see that waning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0a0RTZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fandomization of finance was inevitable&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N26zq8"&gt;It’s not just that. Stocks are easy to meme, says Chad Byers of Susa Ventures, an early investor in Robinhood. “It’s the one part of money you talk about with your friends at the dinner table: stocks,” Byers says. People aren’t exactly running around bragging about their high-yield savings accounts. “Stocks are this inherently conversational, viral topic among the financial world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfgO0I"&gt;That cuts both ways: because stocks are viral, there’s incentive to become a stock influencer, get lots of views, and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-17/social-media-influencers-income-advertising-wall-street-products"&gt;make more money than bankers&lt;/a&gt;. It also means that brokerage startups get easy word-of-mouth marketing and don’t have to pay as much to acquire users, Byers says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QW0Xgy"&gt;In some ways, the fandomization of finance was inevitable; fandom has consumed the political sphere already. The Bitcoin community has, for years, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-19/what-the-heck-is-hodl-bitcoin-lingo-for-crypto-noobs-quicktake?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;used memes&lt;/a&gt; and specialized vocabulary to reassure themselves and each other about their investments; the lingo binds the community together as insiders, says Swartz, who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21368876/venmo-paypal-square-cash-app-social-media-payments-new-money-lana-swartz-interview"&gt;also the author&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Money-Payment-Became-Social/dp/0300233221?tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21132917%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Money: How Payment Became Social Media&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RIe2hU"&gt;This isn’t limited to Bitcoin or to Reddit; my Discord direct messages are full of cryptocurrency spam, particularly pump-and-dump schemes. The spam messages I get are probably blasted to everyone in the cryptocurrency, finance, and NFT Discords I hang out in. They seem to be an attempt to harness existing fan communities into get-rich-quick schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xGAITf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Retail investors aren’t saying they’re masters of the universe. They’re saying they’re apes.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvTy7D"&gt;Perhaps naturally, every fandom acquires haters. For the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/26/17505744/elon-musk-fans-tesla-spacex-fandom"&gt;Tesla true believers&lt;/a&gt;, the mirror community &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-01-22/the-tesla-tslaq-skeptics-who-bet-against-elon-musk"&gt;is $TSLAQ.&lt;/a&gt; Some — perhaps many — of these people are actively shorting Tesla. They even have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/01/tesla-shorts-who-take-aerial-pictures-of-parking-lots-launch-web-site.html"&gt;their own research drones&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them just like fighting online. But the thing that holds them together is their sense of community; they are generous with each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NaLey"&gt;Similarly, just as Bitcoin has its true believers, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/"&gt;the Buttcoin community&lt;/a&gt; spends its time making fun of them. Some cryptocurrency haters have embraced the label of being “bitter no-coiners” and spend their free time heckling the true believers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id08HG"&gt;Fandom runs on emotion, so finance fandom means that the affective aspects of trading are front and center. Members of r/WallStreetBets don’t claim to be geniuses with spreadsheets ruthlessly identifying and executing against market inefficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEtoBo"&gt;“Finance always felt like it had to hide what it was doing to distinguish itself from gambling,” Swartz says. “A lot of those illusions have been stripped away. Retail investors aren’t saying they’re masters of the universe. They’re saying they’re apes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jVKar"&gt;They’re also saying they’re “degenerates;” their rallying cry is “we like the stock.” Retail investors are embracing the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/14/732876763/animal-spirits"&gt;“animal spirits” that lurk at the heart of finance&lt;/a&gt;, Swartz says. Emotions and instincts have always guided economic behavior; with retail investors forming communities, those emotions are likely to play an outsized role in the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWQF2L"&gt;These groups have offline predecessors in investment clubs, which really took off in the 1990s. In those clubs, retail investors pooled their money because they were too small to attract much broker attention; collectively, however, they were essentially a small mutual fund. Sometimes these groups were coworkers or friends — people who already had social ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="t50Erp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;r/WallStreetBets also provides identities for investors who lose their money — as many retail traders do&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oQi8TD"&gt;These clubs came into vogue as pensions became a thing of the past, and the risk of managing money for retirement fell on individuals. Club members had a daunting task: predicting the future. What stocks would go up? Many of them relied on “social identity and social interaction to create mental maps of the stock market,” according to &lt;em&gt;Pop Finance&lt;/em&gt;, a sociological study by Brooke Harrington of some investment clubs active during the late 1990s stock bubble. For instance, a group declined to invest in Harley Davidson, which was hot at the time, because they didn’t want their kids to ride motorcycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3TcM6"&gt; For a more recent example, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738240/donald-trump-truth-social-spac-dwac-stock-merger"&gt;Donald Trump’s SPAC&lt;/a&gt;: Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group, which plans to merge with Digital World Acquisition Company. The day after it was announced, shares of DWAC shot up to close at $94.20, almost 100 times the price the day before. The deal hasn’t closed — and may not close! SPAC deals don’t always go through! — but for Trump fans who want to demonstrate their support, well, this is an easy way to do it. It success even &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/trump-nft-helps-mint-another-meme-stock-tied-to-former-president"&gt;spawned an NFT drop&lt;/a&gt; of Trump signing someone’s breast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMkL9L"&gt;Fandoms aside, retail investors today are even more likely to be overwhelmed by their options. But social media also provides identity-based guidance for investing, whether you’re a Bitcoin Maxi or a r/WallStreetBets degenerate. Participating in an online community can even influence your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTPVB5"&gt;For instance, r/WallStreetBets also provides identities for investors who lose their money — as many retail traders do. The practice of posting “loss porn” transforms the shame of being a bad investor to the pride of being a member of the community who’s truly yoloing; and after all, this doesn’t change their sense that the market is stacked against them. Reframing these losses lets these investors see themselves as something other than suckers who are being fleeced for everything they’re worth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ug0LQ"&gt;This may also explain why people participate in pump-and-dump cryptocurrency schemes, even though there’s a high likelihood they’ll be bagholders. The &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; of being an active investor, especially in the cryptocurrency space, is more important than returns. After all, in the US at least, having a stock portfolio is a status indicator — and in some circles online, playing in cryptocurrency establishes one’s internet bona fides. So far, so similar to the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkRNQv"&gt;But one major difference between today’s influx of retail investors and those who were involved in investing clubs is the availability of information, free trades, and new platforms. Those platform dynamics may have an outsized influence on finance if retail trading stays strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6It7V5eJ4hYvb9VAmCpYb4PCnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968231/VRG_ILLO_4825_Future_of_Money_Spot_2.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5L6Yb9"&gt;Take, for instance, push-notification arbitrage. Here’s how it works: You know that Robinhood will send a push notification if, let’s say, GameStop goes up 5 percent. So you get in at 4.9 percent, either triggering the push alert yourself or waiting for another trade to do so. When it goes out, more people will buy, but not you — you’ll sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVMlmM"&gt;This works because platforms such as Robinhood default to sending push alerts on price. They do this because they make money every time you trade; Robinhood and other retail investing platforms aren’t neutral. These apps — and others like them — are the main way that retail investors interact with the stock market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdyAFx"&gt;The push notifications are a major, obvious way platform dynamics manifest for the newer, mobile-first apps. Webull is needy, overusing push notifications; Coinbase alerts are lightly deranged and don’t seem to follow a pattern. In terms of notifications, Sofi is the least invasive of the bunch. Stash Financial has gone in the most heavily on gamification — the last two push notifications I have from them are about bonus stocks, a “stock party,” and a $1,000 Costco gift card giveaway. Stash certainly &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-15/robinhood-wannabes-dare-regulators-with-embrace-of-games-prizes"&gt;isn’t the only app&lt;/a&gt; offering prizes to increase engagement, either — Webull has a prize wheel like that on The Price is Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="TDhYGC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is so scary what you can actually get ahold of through Robinhood without realizing it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIX2jN"&gt;The other trend across these apps is the simplicity of use — the experience is relatively frictionless. I barely realized I was agreeing to open a retirement account on Stash until it happened! They also create the illusion of near-instantaneous trading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKO1yb"&gt;That’s not all. Making trading easier for ordinary people also means it’s easier to take on stupid amounts of risk. “It is so scary what you can actually get ahold of through Robinhood without realizing it,” says Rogozinski. Between leverage and options, it’s possible to wind up making massive trades with relatively small amounts of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr9nI5"&gt;In a world where the brokers are mobile-first applications, rather than people, platform effects have outsized influence. And the norms of startup behavior — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287381/robinhood-citadel-financial-services-house-day-traders"&gt;as Robinhood users can attest &lt;/a&gt;— mean that the focus is often on building scale &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;at the cost of stability&lt;/a&gt;. Whoopsie, says Robinhood, you can’t trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDkTpx"&gt;Which means that apps can become so powerful that they influence markets. Coinbase, a trading platform by and for the wildly passionate cryptocurrency community, has reached such a scale that it can now move prices on cryptocurrencies &lt;em&gt;simply by announcing it will list them&lt;/em&gt;, Byers says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1c9eiI"&gt;Then there are the &lt;em&gt;regular&lt;/em&gt; platform dynamics — there’s plenty of terrible financial advice out there on TikTok, for instance. And while it’s possible that people who get that bad financial advice could sue, the question is, you know, with what money?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i6hpzz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFTs are just the beginning, but cryptocurrency can be hard for beginners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qRSI02"&gt;Still, with the memable stocks as the tip of the spear, fintech companies have been consolidating their services. “You’re going to go back to re-bundling as these dominant single-use products become multi-use and then specifically start to get banking charters and become essentially full-service digital banks,” Byers says. They can point their large customer bases to their new products easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3MSj8"&gt;Some of this has already happened: Paypal and its subsidiary Venmo allow cryptocurrency trading, though they were originally built for sending payments. Robinhood now has &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/banking/robinhood-cash-management-review"&gt;a cash management tool&lt;/a&gt; — which is &lt;em&gt;similar&lt;/em&gt; to a savings account without the virtue of actually &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHfm7H"&gt;Several people I spoke to pointed to blockchain-based finance and games as the major thing that’s coming next. The decentralized finance world has gotten increasingly sophisticated, and NFTs are just the beginning. I am somewhat more skeptical, partly because cryptocurrency is notorious for scams and can be hard for beginners. But even DeFi follows the trend: the alternative to banks is now, apparently, trying to figure out banking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wEKLP"&gt;It’s possible that retail investors will lose interest — some analysts have &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f9d546a3-cd7c-419b-844d-7039a1eb5294"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s already happening, too. Charles Schwab, for instance, reported an 8 percent drop in retail trades between the second and third quarters of 2021. Robinhood itself, the meme brokerage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-26/robinhood-crypto-trading-craters-as-revenue-misses-estimates?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;missed third quarter revenue estimates&lt;/a&gt;, as fewer people were trading cryptocurrencies. It also projected less trading in the fourth quarter than in the first half of this year. This makes sense; the pandemic-related enthusiasm couldn’t last forever. Still, not &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; who got involved with retail trading is likely to drop out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ae6c4J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Institutional and retail investors both make these mistakes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPHbFb"&gt;Which makes me wonder what the finance influencers mean for regular banking, though. During the pandemic, there were several funny trades that occurred because people got too excited about Elon Musk’s tweets. Signal Advance, a small component manufacturer with just one full-time employee, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/signal-advance-jumps-another-438percent-after-elon-musk-fueled-buying-frenzy.html"&gt;shot up in value&lt;/a&gt; after Musk tweeted “Use Signal” in reference to the encrypted messaging app. Later, when Musk tweeted about using Clubhouse, a voice chat app that’s still a private company, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-clubhouse-stocks-musk/papa-musk-tweets-raise-cheer-in-wrong-clubhouse-idUSKBN2A2263"&gt;investors mistakenly bought shares&lt;/a&gt; in Clubhouse Media Group, an unrelated Chinese company. When Facebook changed its name to Meta, well, material-science company &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/confusion-or-meme-play-meta-materials-stock-soars-after-facebooks-name-change-11635478584"&gt;Meta Materials’ stock shot up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="zcUj4d"&gt;Institutional and retail investors &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=198103020022120073086107010078078122042048077048056085078021004029082029117121082105061019106057060060051028089109074064118027023021012013031102071120003120115004110030021049123001091100076020126078125077085099014103085081011077112112079026085067003126&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;both make these mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, which are more likely when an unscheduled event — such as new company guidance or a Musk tweet — occurs. Perhaps next year, a fund will post a job ad, asking for an analyst who monitors influencers after someone makes a wild gamble based on an up-and-coming TikTok influencer, and rocket rocket heart eyes the fund to the moooooooon. WAGMI, the hedge funds will say.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Public transportation can save the world — if we let it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uUnrldP51S4k4kr2It-A5k2g3nU=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073720/kmcclellan_211008_4786_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n9fCQq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIpttW"&gt;Caleb Spronk, 35, has a lot of great memories — and some not-so-great ones, too — of riding public transportation in Minneapolis. There were the random conversations with strangers, late-night rides after last call at the bar, and those raucous times packed onto a Metro Transit train with dozens of other Twins fans after a big win at Target Field. Even the time he was slapped in the face by a teenager who didn’t take kindly to Spronk’s request to stop holding the doors open wasn’t enough to taint the overall experience of riding transit in the Twin Cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2V7Xz4"&gt;Then Covid hit, and Spronk, like many people, stopped using the train. As a software developer, he was privileged to be able to work from home. But when he eventually returns to the office — which he assumes he will at some point — Spronk said he may just end up walking rather than using public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9Alp6"&gt;“​​I’m not afraid,” he said, “I regretfully just don’t need to use it anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADNtBw"&gt;Spronk isn’t alone. Nationally, &lt;a href="https://www.apta.com/wp-content/uploads/APTA-COVID-19-Funding-Impact-2021-01-27.pdf"&gt;transit ridership fell by 80 percent&lt;/a&gt; in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic. Those numbers have improved but are still below pre-pandemic levels, despite the widespread availability of vaccines and the loosening of state restrictions. There is a growing fear in the transit community: what if riders don’t come back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChRA9O"&gt;With government budgets strained as a result of the pandemic, experts worry that transit could be on the chopping block based on the historical reasoning that fewer riders means fewer dollars will be needed. That could create something called a “death spiral” — a cycle of terrible service leading to even fewer riders, leading to even more terrible service, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;7:13 PM on October 13, 2021 in Houston, TX. People settle into a stable position as they ride the Southline after getting on at the TMC/Dryden light rail stop in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="UVnWhf"&gt;There’s more at stake than good buses and trains. The recent report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirms that a hotter, wetter, more inhospitable future is all but certain. The transportation sector is responsible for nearly a third of greenhouse gases, most of which come from tailpipe emissions. High-quality mass transit can do a lot to fight climate change, but only if people are willing to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqTrGV"&gt;Cleaner air, a cooler Earth, more vibrant and diverse cities — these are the things that reliable public transportation can give us. The question is not whether public transportation can survive Covid; it’s whether we can survive without public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYNsia"&gt;The emergence of the Delta variant has cast a shadow over transit’s planned comeback. Bus ridership has recovered to 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, while rail ridership has recovered to only 40 percent. As hospital beds filled up in some states over the summer, many employers delayed their office re-openings until 2022. Experts predict it may take many months, if not years, for ridership to return to normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwUEan"&gt;There is a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak. Congress approved $70 billion in funding for public transportation as part of the two emergency stimulus packages, more than 300 percent of transit’s average annual federal appropriations. Public transit agencies could get even more funding, depending on how the precarious negotiations over President Joe Biden’s infrastructure plan shake out. That plan includes $39 billion for public transit systems through 2026, a historic infusion of cash will help many transit systems stay afloat, maybe even expand and improve, but it’s not a permanent solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5siaii"&gt;There will always be people who use transit because of its convenience, it’s affordability, and its reliability. But what happens when transit loses riders like Spronk, a rider by choice, who prior to the pandemic was a daily user? Now, Spronk says he’s left with his memories, some of which include using superior train systems in Europe and Asia while traveling abroad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTqF3z"&gt;“I just know we’re going to get further and further away from that type of system,” Spronk said, “if we don’t start prioritizing mass transit systems more than we currently do.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owWkKhWPYW75Vx0VTdi2XeROY0g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966129/kmcclellan_211008_4786_0050.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="cC1LSe"&gt;As Andy Byford, former president of the New York City Transit Authority, current president of Transport for London, and the man affectionately called “Train Daddy” by his fans (yes, a transit administrator has honest-to-god fans), likes to say, “running a transit system is like Groundhog Day; each day is the same, but it should be better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuLwn8"&gt;The pandemic has upended that ethos. Each day, transit leaders are waking up to new headaches. Right now, they are facing the impossible task of keeping revenues afloat in the face of historic rider shortages while also maintaining service for the riders who never left and trying to convince those who did that it’s safe to come back. Tomorrow, the challenge will be how to protect against rising sea levels, deadly heat waves, and other climate change-related disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bBN3u"&gt;In interviews with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, transit leaders tried to sound optimistic in the face of these compounding challenges. Delta already scrambled a lot of comeback plans, but a lot depends on where you live. Texas is being hit harder than California, for example, which is why Bob Powers, general manager of the Bay Area Rapid Transit, said the numbers he was seeing regarding ridership were “encouraging,” while Thomas Lambert, who runs Houston’s Metro system, was less cheerful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul0v8L"&gt;“I don’t know the answer, to be very candid with you,” Lambert said when asked how the pandemic will affect Houston’s ridership long-term. “We were on a different path, probably a couple of months ago, when we saw a decline in the number of positive [Covid] cases. In the last couple of months, we’ve seen those numbers go up a lot,” he said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03S20Q"&gt;“There was a plan, probably going back to May and June, that we were going to see more employers bringing employees back in September,” he continued. “Now we’re seeing them rethink that. So I’m not really sure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWm2UV"&gt;Case numbers are decreasing across the country, and there is hope that we’re already through the worst of the pandemic, but the virus isn’t done with us yet. And there are questions of what will happen as the weather gets colder and people start to let their guard down again. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="gMH344"&gt;Lambert and other agency leaders expressed bewilderment as to what will come next. They want to lay more track, improve bus routes, and introduce innovations, like tap-to-pay fare payments and other high-tech ideas. But they also need to cover their operating expenses and make up for the drop in revenue at the farebox. If there is indeed a once-in-a-generation opportunity to be seized, there is also confusion as to how to go about the actual seizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1prqGr"&gt;Transit leaders will also need to resist the urge to outsource services to tech startups promising salvation, experts say. For the past decade, tech companies have been aggressively lobbying local governments looking for subsidies or relaxed rules for services that seek to compete with or undermine transit. Ride-hailing apps like Uber or Lyft, autonomous vehicle companies, and even air taxi startups will publicly say they want to compliment and improve transit, but what they really want is more people using single-occupancy vehicles.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XNxDfp"&gt;Buzzy projects like “mobility-as-a-service” (MaaS) are gaining traction in a few cities. Pittsburgh, which has long been a hub for autonomous vehicle testing thanks to Carnegie Mellon University, has recently embarked on an experiment to integrate multiple transportation services, like public transportation, car share, electric scooters, and ride-hailing, into a single smartphone app in the hopes of making it easier for users to get around without a car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPAWKs"&gt;“We’re making it super intuitive to open up a single app, with everything in one place,” Karina Ricks, director of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-22/pittsburgh-borrows-a-mobility-concept-from-finland"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CityLab &lt;/em&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxVrC8"&gt;It’s still early days for MaaS. It won’t be clear whether it’s working in Pittsburgh for at least a decade, as city officials have said their goal is to halve tailpipe emissions and vehicle miles traveled by 2030. The key to their success? Frequent, reliable public transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf9KTR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cJXehcr9LHPTZNGwY6Kwqz9j-5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22966127/amulligan_211014_4786_0002_1.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="VwxuwN"&gt;Bigger questions remain about how public transportation needs to work in order to meet current and future demands, with experts and academics arguing that the whole design is out-of-whack and needs to be rethought. Most public transportation is built around a hub-and-spoke model, bringing people who live in the suburbs into the city for work or shopping. That system has waned in relevance over several decades as suburban office parks cropped up, business districts decentralized, and sprawl pushed people further away where density and land use patterns didn’t support transit. The pandemic has only underscored the irrelevance of the hub-and-spoke model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UFCD14"&gt;Bob Powers, who runs San Francisco’s BART system, said the morning and evening rush has declined since the pandemic. “The morning peak and the PM peak, you know, kind of come down a little bit, and they’re not so peaky,” he said. “I think it’s a little bit difficult to predict, but I certainly think there’s going to be a change in the rigor of commute hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22zvdH"&gt;Powers said the emergency funding from Congress has helped provide breathing room so BART can think about how it needs to adapt to this new style of remote work while also providing service for women, youth, and low-income workers — “folks that are not 9-to-5 typical commuters” as Powers describes them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d347FS"&gt;Rather than mourn the death of peak service, transit experts are dancing on its grave. “The decline of the peak is probably one of the most positive stories out of this,” said Jarrett Walker, a transit consultant from Portland, OR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWphxq"&gt;Transportation systems are made for rush hour. Its why highways are so wide and mass transit systems run more frequently during the morning and evening hours. If transit agencies can pivot to a more reliable all-around service, Walker said there’s no end to the positive change that can occur. “Suddenly, there will no longer be any excuse to widen roads because of rush hour,” he said. “A whole bunch of arguments for things will go away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDduZD"&gt;If, after the pandemic, white-collar workers continue to stay away from morning and evening rush hour and instead work from home while using transit as needed, such as to come into the office a couple times a week, then rush hour will continue to stay flat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvaJ78"&gt;Running better all-of-the-time service would also do a lot to help lure people out of their cars and reduce carbon emissions. Recent studies have revealed that a single person who switches from a 20-mile commute by car to a bus or train ride can reduce their annual CO2 emissions by 20 pounds per day, or more than 48,000 pounds in a year. That’s equal to a 10 percent reduction in all greenhouse gases produced by a typical two-adult, two-car household.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="vdRWMr"&gt;If people can use mass transit to pick their kids up from school or run errands, they are less likely to be dependent on their vehicles. This is also an issue of racial and economic equity. Lower-income people are less likely to be rush hour commuters and more likely to need transit all of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1I7Uo"&gt;Transit leaders often point to their experiments with microtransit or outsourcing those services to tech companies like Uber, Lyft, and Via, as proof they are thinking creatively about the future of public transportation. But the humble bus, with its ability to change routes easily, is often neglected in the face of these shinier options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vS0v3P"&gt;“A lot of times, we focus on the rail system,” said Zabe Brent, director of design at the National Association of City Transportation Officials. “But we also saw during the pandemic that the bus systems were both more flexible to the changes that needed to be made, as well as more comfortable for a lot of people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lp5MXk"&gt;A bus with more frequent and reliable service is worth more than anything that has emerged from Silicon Valley, especially if so-called “essential workers” take the spotlight away from white-collar workers as the primary users of transit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcBrCE"&gt;Not only is installing a bus rapid transit system orders of magnitude cheaper than most rail projects, but buses are also scrappy fighters of inequality. Surveys show that the majority of people who use rail are white and well-off, while buses tend to support lower-income riders and people of color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZONq7z"&gt;“How do we redesign our networks in a way that is more considerate of the vast amount of needs of residents instead of just a select few,” said Charles Brown, founder and CEO of Equitable Cities, a transportation consultancy focused on inequality. “Rail is much more difficult because it’s on this fixed track from node to node. Whereas the bus, you have an opportunity to be more flexible and more creative in terms of getting people to places beyond their job.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;11:05 AM on October 8th, 2021 at Glen Park Bart Station, San Francisco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="Y1dl0b"&gt;Before the pandemic, only 5 percent of Americans used transit to commute to work. Ridership was already dropping before Covid even appeared on these shores. The distinctly American habit of driving alone to work, rather than carpooling or using mass transit, has clogged our roads, dirtied our skies, and made traffic fatalities a leading cause of death for many age groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjjpkV"&gt;Those fatality numbers worsened during the pandemic, despite fewer cars on the road overall. Road deaths jumped 7.2 percent in 2020 from the year before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518496/2020-traffic-crash-death-nhtsa-pandemic-driving"&gt;hitting a 13-year high&lt;/a&gt;, even though lockdown orders forced many people off the roads. And as society reopened — and our streets were once again flooded with cars — &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/2021-09/Early-Estimate-Motor-Vehicle-Traffic-Fatalities-Q1-2021.pdf"&gt;US traffic fatalities jumped 10.5 percent in the first quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmc4bg"&gt;Elected officials always say that they believe transit is essential for our cities to thrive in a future that’s healthier, safer, and more equitable. But the way they spend taxpayer money indicates a clear bias towards car drivers, with four out of every five dollars spent on surface transportation going to highway programs. As long as public transportation is “under the boot” of these policymakers, as Transportation for America’s Beth Osborne says, there is little hope that mass transit systems can be redesigned to meet the needs of the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZK8mdG"&gt;“Across the board, we fall victim to the notion that transportation is the point,” she said. “Transportation is the point of nothing. It’s where you’re going that is the point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSngTM"&gt;One problem is the restrictions that Congress places on the money. Agencies cannot use funding from the surface transportation reauthorization for day-to-day operating expenses, such as paying salaries and buying fuel. Instead, much of that money is dedicated to building new rail lines, even when agencies do not have the funds to operate existing lines. Federal transit policy is designed for politicians who love ribbon-cuttings as opposed to actual riders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="clKCkZ"&gt;As the infrastructure deal nears the finish line, transit advocates are scrambling to secure as much money for transit as possible. Biden’s push to electrify vehicles will help fight climate change, but a clean traffic jam is still just a traffic jam. High-quality transit is the only real solution to our vast, seemingly intractable problems with climate change, inequality, land use, and housing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggLG4S"&gt;It can seem daunting, Osborne said, with the virus still raging throughout the country and a sense that the political winds are shifting against those who believe that transit can save us. But huge challenges often beget huge opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9MAh8"&gt;“On one hand, it’s like, ‘Oh no, we have to go through a whole other layer of reconsideration and change, and that’s scary,’” Osborne said. “But on the other hand, how exciting! We get to go out and experiment, try things in a totally different way, and service people in a different way that could save them money, save lives, and reduce emissions. That sounds really cool to me.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smartphone, circa 2031</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m0uSK-jagKFFbl4vRhVW99It9YI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073692/acastro_futurePhones_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Small improvements can go in surprising and strange directions&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4jZPAe"&gt;What will the smartphone look like in 10 years? The most likely answer, I’m afraid, is one of two options: it’s either completely unknowable or disappointingly predictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27vqaP"&gt;The story of the smartphone thus far began with technological breakthroughs paired with ingenuity (Camera + Data = Instagram) but eventually evolved into a yearly cadence of iterative improvements (better camera). Ten years from now, when we gaze upon the devices in our hands (or, less likely, consider the implant in our spinal columns), I expect we’re going to be telling one of those two stories again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeSxP5"&gt;The most likely story, as always, is iteration. Absent some breakthrough, we’ll likely have much more impressive versions of the things we can buy today. Nearly every time somebody says that there will be a massive breakthrough in five to 10 years — be it self-driving cars or augmented reality — the safest bet is that they’ll be making the same prediction five years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc4Hyk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="36BPI7"&gt;Even with iterative updates, smartphones will be radically better than they are today, and they’ll be different in some ways, too. The screens will be brighter and fold in different ways, the cameras will be so advanced that they’ll threaten to obviate even higher-end SLRs, and the digital assistants inside them will be smarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TaFnCJ"&gt;It’s easy to underestimate how important iterative changes can be. Would Instagram have been born if the original iPhone camera hadn’t been kind of junky? Would it still exist if that camera hadn’t become so good it has destroyed entire categories of products? OLED is just a new way of displaying pixels, but it can flex and uses very little power, so now our phones fold in half, and we take calls on our wrist computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO93Vi"&gt;A simple, incremental advancement in a component can simply make our phones faster — or it can surprise everybody by catalyzing a shift in culture. More of those changes are in our future, and many of them will be emergent behaviors catalyzed by some seemingly insignificant spec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Yv9zz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — but that doesn’t mean phones will become less important or impactful&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RVhTLB"&gt;Take ultra wideband, for example. It’s the chip in top-end phones that allows them to locate other devices in space and also transmit small bits of data — to unlock a door, for example. Right now, it’s used to locate gadgets in the couch cushions, and there’s a promise it’ll unlock your car door soon. But just as we didn’t initially realize that GPS + Data = Uber, we don’t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; know yet what else UWB could unlock (pardon the pun). I could guess, but such guesses often end up looking like the naive predictions of overly optimistic futurists. UWB could come to naught.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1dB3Z"&gt;Whatever happens, the iterative path for smartphones will inevitably mean each phone launch will be less exciting than the last — a trend we’re already familiar with today. But that doesn’t mean that phones will become less important or impactful. Instead, they’ll become more familiar and (forgive another pun) part of the fabric of our culture. We’ll begin to more clearly see that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;phones function as a kind of fashion&lt;/a&gt;. That they will follow yearly trends that will be a lot more about style than function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPGhgH"&gt;With any luck, we’ll also have a deeper and more self-conscious awareness of the smartphone’s place in our culture, just as we have with fashion. My hope is that phones will be ever-present without being all-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5b0wV"&gt;I hate to start on a down note about the future of technological progress, but it’s important to stay a little grounded in reality. I could spin a tale about phones that project their displays into mid-air between your fingers. I could predict that we won’t have phones at all but, instead, high-bandwidth jacks plugged right into our brains, connecting us into a 6 or 7G network of wordless, emotive communication. But getting from here to there requires more leaps than can responsibly be made, both ethically and imaginatively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="D7DSEA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KR6o3"&gt;Fourteen years ago, Palm founder Jeff Hawkins unveiled his last big idea for tech. He had beat the tech giants in PDA with the PalmPilot and created the Treo smartphone well ahead of the iPhone or Android. His third and final act was to be a different kind of computer, a dummy terminal that simply acted as a window into your phone, where all your real data lived. It was called the Foleo, and it never launched — Palm had more immediate worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JD2vIE"&gt;Today, the Foleo seems naive. We don’t need to store our lives in our phones — all that data can live in the cloud. And the phones themselves would become more engaging in and of themselves than Hawkins could have predicted. They’re the engines of content creation and consumption that drive an ouroboros economy worth billions, if not trillions of dollars. Instead of the Foleo, we have Chromebooks and iPads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbhGxQ"&gt;None of those developments had happened in 2007, and few of them would have been predictable. That’s the way with some technological advancements: they can drive changes in culture that head in surprising and strange directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ugd3mR"&gt;We can try to guess what some of those advancements might actually be. Certainly, there are some promising directions like AR glasses, folding displays, the chance that modularity will finally work, and even that our phones will stop consolidating into a single device and instead explode out into a mesh network of tinier, more bespoke gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnyDUC"&gt;We can’t say what phones &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; look like in 10 years. But here are some guesses of what they &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; look like. –Dieter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="dPJtjB"&gt;Foldables&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6WcXfG"&gt;Wouldn’t it be better if our phones could shape-shift into a size fit for the task at hand? That’s the promise behind foldables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0T9d1"&gt;Before foldable devices really take off, a couple of things need to be figured out, starting with the issue of cost. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 takes folding phones a little closer to the mainstream with a $999 price tag, but that’s still out of reach for many people, and the bigger foldables like the Fold 3 remain closer to $2,000. Manufacturers will need to be able to make those folding components more efficiently at a lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iTC58SUgGZxWe47wxCYdS451C7w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967707/acastro_211028_0002.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DCK6yF"&gt;Durability is another major concern — foldables require more delicate screens, along with hinges and moving parts that are much more difficult to seal against dust and water than the components of a standard candy bar-shaped phone. Samsung has gotten creative to make its folding phones more durable (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;when in doubt, inject it with cure-in-place goo!&lt;/a&gt;), but many more solutions will be needed for screens that roll and flex. It doesn’t help that we’re all conditioned to expect a certain level of durability from our devices that phones of the future will need to meet. –Allison&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="itMC2U"&gt;Modular&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="RgiF7k"&gt;The smartphone industry has dabbled in modular phones over the years, teasing a future filled with devices that can morph and upgrade as needed, adding on better cameras, different sensors, and surprising new capabilities. But time and again, the idea has failed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZEXRO"&gt;There was LG’s G5, which let you slide out its bottom section to add on a hi-fi DAC or a camera attachment with a dedicated shutter button. But LG gave up on the entire concept by the next year. Then Motorola gave it a go with its Moto Z lineup, creating a system where accessories could magnetically attach to the back of the phone. There were battery packs, a JBL speaker, a Hasselblad camera, and even a competent movie projector, and they worked across several generations of devices. But sales figures didn’t measure up, and eventually, the modular push fell by the wayside.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3oda8GG_rOloHvewsc59p2TgMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967721/acastro_211028_0001.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wPaRZj"&gt;By comparison to those efforts, Google’s Project Ara seemed like the true modular dream. As the company pitched it, you’d someday be able to swap out individual components of a phone — processor, camera sensor / lenses, battery, and even the display — and keep your original device up to date with the latest hardware advancements by regularly replacing its guts. But the company threw in the towel on Project Ara and its LEGO-style upgrades before ever shipping hardware to developers. It’s a damn shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLE7A0"&gt;There’s certainly a technical challenge to pulling off our sci-fi modular phone fantasies. Google had to pull back on its ambitions with Ara and ended up integrating the CPU and display into the device’s frame, meaning they wouldn’t be replaceable. And perhaps the biggest reason that piecemeal smartphones would never work is profit margin. When Samsung, Apple, and other companies can charge $1,000 for fresh devices every year, what’s the incentive for them to adopt a modular approach that allows consumers to spend less money and upgrade their phones with the latest groundbreaking tech? Maintaining compatibility with a modular system over years could also slow companies from trying to push forward with more inventive, futuristic designs. It’s hard to look at something like the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and see how there’d be an easy way to swap out its components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbVmXA"&gt;But in 10 years, maybe the mobile industry will have evolved to a point where modular phones make a comeback. That, or the right to repair initiative could win so big that companies will make it so much easier to repair our gadgets that it almost feels like they’re modular. We can dream, right? –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Bi61Bf"&gt;Smart glasses&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="iHmNjZ"&gt;The most tempting prediction to make is that in 10 years’ time, the handheld smartphone as we know it will be replaced — or at least relegated to our pockets more often than not — by smart eyeglasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YKpYf8"&gt;We’re already on the path, though early attempts like Google Glass were too rudimentary, creepy, and strange-looking. More recent tries from companies like Focal still depend on the phone for too much of their functionality. Meta, the newly rebranded company behind Facebook, is continuing to explore the concept, and Apple’s oft-rumored mixed reality glasses remain in development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="phwHeW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The main obstacle is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PUJBCM"&gt;But it doesn’t take much to imagine a sleek future pair of fully independent smart glasses with lenses that double as private displays for things like our notifications, real-time AR directions, and video streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUDbQn"&gt;The main obstacle between existing and more capable smart glasses is being able to shrink all the necessary technology down into a pair that normal people would want to wear in public. Display technology also isn’t quite where it needs to be just yet. Some past smart glasses have projected their UI onto the lens glass, but that’s where things get bulky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lQfEDH"&gt;The other fundamental challenge is coming up with an interface that makes sense and feels like the right fit between your eyes and the outside world. Eye tracking would have to play some part in that. Think of how often you check your phone throughout the day. No one would want to be constantly futzing with swipe and tap gestures on their glasses that frequently. Voice dictation also needs to evolve beyond its current performance on mobile devices if we’re going to be comfortable leaving our foldable phones or slabs at home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtDR8F"&gt;Even if this is all figured out, the tried and true smartphone won’t be history in 10 years — productivity and other tasks simply lend themselves better to a device with a screen and keyboard.  –Chris&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YGtT7L"&gt;Ambient computing&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="q3kBcs"&gt;In the most sci-fi-fueled visions of the next 10 years, a phone isn’t something we carry around with us — it’s everywhere. Every room in your home has a smart speaker, a screen, a lamp, and who knows what, that’s connected to the network and ready to do whatever you would have asked of your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkZoBO"&gt;Outside of the home is more of the same. We don’t carry a personal device with us — it’s in our cars, at our bus stops, in every public trashcan and streetlight. Rather than face the onerous task of taking a phone out of your pocket, unlocking it, opening the right app, and typing words on its little screen, the world around us will simply be equipped to do the tedious stuff for us. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FCaPnUdkLnCrjrU7GmTJvS6hfnI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22967701/acastro_211028_0003.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="509FI2"&gt;Need to send a message to your mom asking how she’s feeling after her bionic limb replacement? Your bathroom mirror was two steps ahead of you and sent the message this morning. Running into the store for last-minute dinner ingredients? Your shopping cart already talked to your refrigerator and knows what you need to buy, which aisle it’s on, and how to pay for it all once you’re done. We’ll outsource the personal bits from personal computing, freed from the confines of little glowing screens and just moving through the world like Sims. It’ll be great. Or awful! Probably awful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q89t9K"&gt;There are very obvious and serious ethical problems with this scenario. Equipping the world around us to anticipate and solve our needs requires us to surrender an incredible amount of information about ourselves. And what happens when the almighty algorithm decides that we’re acting suspiciously by analyzing our sleep patterns, purchases, and oral hygiene habits? Just take a look through the last 70 years of sci-fi movies and literature if you want to know how &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; works out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rise of the super app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u_VXhIGLvG3iVkIChH6CQbQ6HH0=/0x469:1080x1189/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70073681/VRG_ILLO_4846_10_Year_social_media.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Social media companies are increasingly super apps that encompass more of what we do online, for better or worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WqWboc"&gt;Say you want to see Japanese Breakfast play in Sacramento next week with a couple of friends. The process of going requires jumping between at least a few apps — you might coordinate plans on WhatsApp, buy your tickets from Ticketmaster, book a ride through Uber, and pay each other back for drinks over Venmo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBAdmO"&gt;But what if all that activity happened in one app on your phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bfgb7"&gt;Over the next several years, I predict that the biggest social media companies around the world will become super apps, acting as gatekeepers to a wider array of things people do online. While they started as ways to mainly keep in contact with friends and family or be entertained, these social networks — Facebook, Snap, and TikTok, for example — will become increasingly important ways people shop, bank, and entertain themselves. Some of these firms that started in the US, such as Snapchat, are already starting to resemble super apps, even though they’re still primarily thought of as social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eM72El"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Western social media firms are playing catch-up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yjPwuZ"&gt;The idea of the super app first gained popularity in China with WeChat, the messaging app that essentially acts as a platform for facilitating life online in the world’s most populous country. WeChat doesn’t just let you message your friends and see their updates in a feed; it can also be used to take out a loan to buy your next car. Commerce done through mini-apps that WeChat lets other developers build on its platform reached a staggering $240 billion last year alone, more than double from the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPWqBp"&gt;In the Western world, social media firms are playing catch-up. They’re morphing from single or dual-use case apps — messaging friends or browsing feeds of content — to encompass more and more of what people do online. Last year, Facebook started adding shopping features that keep users from needing to complete purchases elsewhere. The head of Instagram, which is part of Facebook’s family of apps, recently made headlines when he said the app was no longer primarily about sharing photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JomzGl"&gt;WhatsApp, which is also part of Facebook, recently added a directory in South America to let users find local businesses, and in India, it’s trialing banking products like loans. Twitter started as an SMS, text-based service, but now, it lets users natively host audio rooms and newsletters and put their tweets behind a paywall. TikTok recently added an in-app shopping experience and introduced a platform for developers to build their own app experiences into its main video feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VW0dJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Becoming a super app is mainly about becoming more integrated into people’s lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GsMsjw"&gt;Out of all the big social media firms not from China, Snapchat is perhaps the furthest along towards becoming a super app. A few years ago, it introduced mini-apps by other developers that let people do things like play games together, mediate, or book movie tickets — all without leaving the app. There are now more than two-dozen mini-apps in Snapchat, though the company hasn’t disclosed overall usage of them yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0IhnA"&gt;In a crowded landscape of apps, becoming a super app is mainly about becoming more integrated into people’s lives and maintaining a grip on their attention, whether it be an endless feed of short videos or an easy way to find clothes to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLekjg"&gt;“Any company that has an app, you’re really focused on getting to the point of being a Home Screen app,” said Nicole Quinn, an investor at Lightspeed Venture Partners who has backed the mental health app Calm and Cameo, an app that lets you book shoutouts from celebrities.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6T_Tg-Rvn_zUOMvSaGDpteSoWiE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22963901/VRG_ILLO_4850_10Year_Speech_Spot.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="numy4G"&gt;A tectonic shift in how the ad-supported app economy works is also driving the rise of super apps. Social media companies that largely thrived from tracking users across different sites can no longer be sure that their ads will lead to someone buying something elsewhere. That data sharing has historically let apps easily track users as they move around the internet, in turn giving advertisers a strong signal about the kinds of ads specific people will respond to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZeMbb"&gt;Apple recently made it harder for third-party iOS apps to share data with other companies for advertising purposes, thanks to a new prompt that’s now shown to users. Google is planning a similar approach for Android and has already announced the end of third-party cookies in its Chrome browser. Regulators around the world, particularly in the European Union, are in addition contemplating laws that would further restrict the sharing of user data between different companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fWj2nH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rise of “content fortresses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HzR0u3"&gt;Simply put, if ad-driven platforms like Facebook can’t track how people interact with other apps, they’ll work more to keep people in their apps as much as possible, especially for activities that involve money like shopping. Eric Seufert, an influential ads industry analyst and consultant, calls this phenomenon the rise of “content fortresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdMJzJ"&gt;Since these changes by Apple and regulators largely don’t restrict how apps collect data about their own users, that first-party data is now more valuable. If a Facebook user makes a purchase without leaving to complete it in another app or website, Facebook can provide that information to the advertiser who paid for the ad that led to the purchase. Advertisers, in turn, pay more money when they know their ads work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NBTeF"&gt;WeChat, by contrast, has been decidedly slow to build an ads business, instead opting to take a cut of transactions done through its app and native payments service. Its parent company Tencent makes most of its money from other areas, such as its many gaming divisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="yqFMXm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest risk to super apps is the increasing scrutiny of the tech industry’s power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9AE6db"&gt;Also helping this trend of super apps is pressure being put on Apple — which controls the most lucrative and second-largest mobile app platform — to loosen its grip on what apps are allowed to do on iOS devices. Apple’s rules currently forbid third-party developers from hosting app stores within their apps, and they’re, for the most part, not allowed to accept purchases in their apps without paying Apple 30 percent. Thanks to legal pressure, that’s starting to change. And if Apple’s rule that bans app stores within third-party iOS apps is ever undone, social networks like Facebook could be freed to host app stores themselves, letting people more easily discover mini-apps or web games within their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWDsDJ"&gt;The biggest risk to companies with super apps — or ambitions to become a super app — is the increasing scrutiny of the tech industry’s power. Regulators in the US and Europe are increasingly more critical of the biggest internet platforms. Even China has, in recent weeks, started forcing WeChat and other local firms to open up their platforms to rivals. It’s a sign that the country where super apps first rose to prominence now sees them as having too much power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tthP1v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are betting on the whole ecosystem becoming big.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VOXyRo"&gt;For now, the biggest super apps are still in China, and they are well ahead in terms of developer activity. There are about three million mini-apps in WeChat and about 1 million in Alipay, the second most popular super app in China. Users in China and other non-western countries have flocked to super apps over the past several years, but it remains to be seen if the concept will take hold with people elsewhere who are already accustomed to downloading lots of apps for different purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSdE9Y"&gt;The main contenders for super apps are apps that integrate payments, according to Kaniyet Rayev, the CEO of a new startup called Appboxo that builds tools to easily let companies create mini-app platforms inside their apps. He started the company after taking a trip to China several years ago with his cofounder Nursultan Keneshbekov, where they observed how much time locals spent using WeChat. Appboxo is now working with companies in southwest Asia, India, Japan, and other parts of the world to help them build developer platforms inside their apps, said Rayev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TUw0L5"&gt;“We are betting on the whole ecosystem becoming big.”&lt;/p&gt;
