    <title>Text messages sent to Google Fi users with Hangouts went missing last week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jRW9YUGdVb_9LAGEBKxFyGe8gqg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092218/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlPyW"&gt;A Google Fi user in Hawaii received a couple text messages Monday night wishing him a happy Easter. The problem is, those messages had been sent on Easter Sunday, but only made it through more than a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSQ6XV"&gt;Google is now informing Fi users who receive text messages through Hangouts that messages sent to them may have gone missing between March 31st and April 5th. The company said there was a service “interruption” that impacted “a small number of people.” Google says it has now resolved the issue and is sending through the delayed messages. Missing messages should appear in Hangouts by the end of today, April 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hdcy2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has now disabled texting from Hangouts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="20M2IH"&gt;Fi users have for years been able to send and receive calls and messages through Hangouts, but Google announced plans years ago to strip those features out as it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18193303/google-hangouts-end-transition-october-gsuite-chat-meet"&gt;transitioned Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; into yet another Google communications app. The features appear to have been disabled within the last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrVcU1"&gt;But the interruption occurred before the service was fully shut down, and so Google is still working to patch the delayed messages through to Hangouts. A Google spokesperson confirmed the service interruption to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and said affected users are being contacted. SMS messages will be delivered to Messages by Google or another default messaging app &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/fi/answer/9984024?hl=en#zippy=%2Cstep-transfer-or-sync-your-text-messages%2Cif-you-used-hangouts-for-your-text-messages"&gt;going forward&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WcLjzZ"&gt;Delayed messages can cause real problems for senders and receivers. In November 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955771/delayed-text-messages-valentines-day-syniverse-total-number-growth-carriers"&gt;more than 168,000 messages&lt;/a&gt; were delivered that had originally been sent on Valentine’s Day 2019, nine months earlier. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953422/text-messages-delayed-received-overnight-valentines-day-delay"&gt;People received confusing, context-free messages&lt;/a&gt; — in some cases, messages came through from people who had died in the months between. The issue was caused by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974692/valentines-day-text-message-delay-explanation-sms-syniverse-carriers"&gt;a server failure at Syniverse&lt;/a&gt;, a firm that routes text messages between carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEpXKN"&gt;Google has been in the process of shutting down Hangouts for years, so it’s possible there weren’t many users left using the service in conjunction with Fi. Even the Fi user in Hawaii — who, full disclosure, is a friend of mine — said they knew they should have switched a while ago and decided not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QRDP0"&gt;“I intentionally put myself in this spot,” Jason Bennett, who received the delayed Easter messages, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;I wanted to see what happened when it went offline.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Lil Nas X’s ‘Twerk Hero’ is a real game where you shake a virtual butt to Montero</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Q8wSKzrjUr0jT_wQ09vL-Aa09E=/0x2:1445x965/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69092064/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_3.13.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5yBtLm"&gt;Rapper Lil Nas X has just released a free rhythm game that has you twerking to his new song “Montero (Call Me By Your Name).” Yes, the main mechanic is twerking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWeuza"&gt;It’s a free browser game, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.monterocallmebyyour.name"&gt;play it right now at this link&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to get an idea of how the game works, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379913998695419905"&gt;check out this video he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. Or just use your imagination. It’s exactly what you think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MoSnst"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PLAY HERE: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O"&gt;https://t.co/pUlUJYhY3O&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/I660hJr9du"&gt;pic.twitter.com/I660hJr9du&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nope   (@LilNasX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1379914189125218305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj5Fv4"&gt;I tried it briefly before writing this post, and I have to admit that I had a hard time lining up my twerks with the on-screen arrows. (What a sentence. Also hi Dad, who gets email notifications whenever I publish a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; story.) But the game says I somehow got 43 of the 50 arrows, and a rating of two and a half stars out of three. I’ll take it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QqZSD"&gt;The new game is Lil Nas X’s latest internet-savvy stunt to help promote the new song. He also collaborated with internet collective MSCHF to release the “Satan Shoes,” which were custom Nikes that supposedly have a drop of blood in them. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357225/nike-sues-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-mschf"&gt;Nike sued MSCHF&lt;/a&gt; over the shoes, seeking a temporary restraining order, but MSCHF said it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22361961/mschf-nike-unauthorized-satan-shoe-lawsuit-response-restraining-order"&gt;no intention&lt;/a&gt; of shipping the 666th pair.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some OnePlus 9 Pro owners say their phones are overheating too easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kr4j8aTv2AP9bty0YLCt0jitcXk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091858/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0065.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnePlus says the excessive overheating warnings some 9 Pro owners are reporting will be addressed soon with a software update&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2Z0yp"&gt;A number of OnePlus 9 Pro owners say they’re getting persistent overheating warnings, often with use of the camera app. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/04/07/oneplus-9-pros-are-overheating-but-a-fix-is-planned/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; spotted the mounting number of reports, many of which are collected in &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/unified-oneplus-9-pro-battery-heating-and-charging-feedback-thread.1412143/"&gt;a thread on OnePlus’ support forum&lt;/a&gt; and often mention use of the camera app in connection with the warnings. OnePlus tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;this is a known issue and that a fix will be coming via software updates “over the next few weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7luEV"&gt;Some 9 Pro owners reporting the problem say that the warning appears even with light use of the phone’s still photo or video recording capabilities, and in some cases the phone will prohibit any more photo taking until it cools back down. Others mention the problem arising around or soon after initial setup. We didn’t encounter the issue while testing the OnePlus 9 Pro for our review, and we haven’t seen it crop up with use since then either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sLBHmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="erWQ7N"&gt;OnePlus gave a lot of thought to heat dissipation in the 9 Pro’s design, which is an especially important consideration for the phone’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22335032/oneplus-9-pro-fast-wireless-charging"&gt;fast wireless charging feature&lt;/a&gt;. To ensure that the phone remains a safe temperature during wireless charging, the 9 Pro includes thicker copper and a larger heat sink than its predecessor. It’s also equipped with two 25W battery cells, which helps control heat in addition to improving charging times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDgpI1"&gt;While it seems the phone is well equipped to deal with heat on the hardware side, users’ description of the problem and the response from OnePlus indicate something might be wrong on the software side. Until that fix arrives, the company encourages 9 Pro owners experiencing problems to &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/feedback"&gt;submit a bug report through its forums&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas’ new kicks can be customized with Lego bricks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yf035IJowJZI02YX1FwI2HTf8i0=/0x140:840x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091777/adidas_Ultraboost_DNA_x_LEGO_r__Plates_Shoes_White_FY7690_011_hover_standard.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWtIhZ"&gt;Adidas has a new version of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Fus%2Fadidas-ultraboost-dna-x-lego-plates-shoes%2FFY7690.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F7%2F22372409%2Fadidas-lego-bricks-custom-ultraboost-dna-x-shoes-sneakers" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ultraboost DNA running shoes&lt;/a&gt; with a unique twist — the company’s iconic three-stripe logo is now made of real plastic Lego bricks, allowing for a pair of more customizable kicks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLUT7R"&gt;Officially known as the Adidas Ultraboost DNA X Lego Plates shoes, the new $200 brick sneakers feature transparent plastic slots on the side in the shape of flat two-by-six Lego plates: enough to fit three two-by-two Lego plates in each stripe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dplFIb"&gt;The shoes also feature a few other Lego homages, including a Lego logo on the tongue and brick-style detailing on the top and sole of the shoes. The interior lining is also done up in a bright Lego yellow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HVZPE4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The new customisable Ultraboost DNA x LEGO Plates running shoes. LEGO Plates included.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adidasxLEGO?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#adidasxLEGO&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HvhYOZex6n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HvhYOZex6n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— LEGO (@LEGO_Group) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LEGO_Group/status/1379750885467754501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="23qLHL"&gt;And while the shoes do come with a collection of bricks in primary colors, there’s presumably nothing stopping you from swapping in your own bricks in more interesting colors for an even more customized look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXotMa"&gt;The whole thing is actually vaguely reminiscent of Crocs — specifically, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152676/crocs-jibbitz-charms-instagram-susan-alexandra-323"&gt;Jibbitz charms&lt;/a&gt; that slot in to let owners put a unique style on their rubberized shoes. The main difference here being that Lego bricks are a bit more common, and the Ultraboost shoes a bit more fashionable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adSKZw"&gt;The Adidas Ultraboost DNA X Lego Plates are set to go on sale on Thursday, April 8th at 10AM ET through the Adidas website for $200. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly discussed buying social audio app Clubhouse for $4 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58Aw8EKi1S8dMtR8LH-HtcLmOI0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091741/mdoying_180117_2249_twitter_0242stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AsW55Y"&gt;Twitter’s already building a competitor to the hot social audio app Clubhouse, but apparently, it’s discussed outright acquiring the company, too. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/twitter-is-said-to-have-discussed-4-billion-clubhouse-takeover"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter held discussions with Clubhouse about purchasing the app for around $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu1f83"&gt;These conversations have reportedly stalled, and it’s unclear why. It’s also unclear whether Twitter or Clubhouse approached the other first, which could speak to how either platform is feeling about the competition in the social audio space. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported yesterday that Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/clubhouse-is-said-to-discuss-funding-at-about-4-billion-value"&gt;is now looking&lt;/a&gt; to raise money at a $4 billion valuation; it’s possible that number came out of these Twitter discussions, or that Clubhouse is shopping that figure around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwXdiJ"&gt;Clubhouse launched last year and popularized the idea of hosting live audio conversations. Celebrities, tech CEOs, and regular folks have since tuned in and hosted rooms. More than 10 million people have reportedly downloaded the app, which is currently invite-only and iOS-only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8x2WP"&gt;The app also faces &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;lots of competitors&lt;/a&gt;, including Facebook, Twitter, Discord, LinkedIn, and Slack, among others. These other platforms already come with built-in user bases of millions of people, as well as fully built web, iOS, and Android apps. Still, Clubhouse is rapidly trying to innovate. It’s staffed up in recent months and hired an engineer to build its Android app. It also, this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"&gt;launched tipping&lt;/a&gt; within the app as a way for creators to make money. (It says it won’t be taking a cut of that revenue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRPEW2"&gt;For its part, Twitter Spaces has already launched on both iOS and Android. The company also plans to launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22363221/twitter-spaces-desktop-web-browsers-clubhouse"&gt;a web version&lt;/a&gt; and to open hosting abilities up to all users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;this month&lt;/a&gt;. Why Twitter would want to acquire Clubhouse doesn’t totally make sense, unless it simply wanted to wipe the competition out and gain its dedicated user base and buzzy name. Either way, Clubhouse and Twitter now will both continue to face each other in the journey to dominate social audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music now has a Car Mode for easier use while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mS3JRb_lbsFa3MCp1ouBRrcteVg=/0x84:3500x2417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091451/CarMode_PR_Version1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aCEhoO"&gt;The Amazon Music mobile app &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23430077011"&gt;is getting a new feature&lt;/a&gt; to make it a little bit easier to use while driving. Car Mode is a simplified version of Amazon Music’s interface, featuring larger buttons, suggested playlists and albums, and easy access to Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gubtBK"&gt;Once enabled, Car Mode is divided into two sections. The upper part near the top of your phone is devoted to playback controls like play, pause, and skip, while the bottom section features a collection of music suggestions which you can switch between with a swipe or a tap. If a hands-free experience sounds better (and it probably should if you’re trying to drive safely) you can trigger Alexa in the bottom right corner with a tap or by using an Alexa voice command (“Hey Alexa, play Elton John”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUdiA-wja3rql-3m2vaRWQjruyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427718/AmazonMusic_CarMode.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CRkTSh"&gt;Car Mode doesn’t add any new functionality to Amazon Music, but its changes to the user interface could make it easier to switch songs or dive into a new playlist without having to take your attention away from the road. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185644/spotify-car-view-now-testing-android-simple-controls"&gt;Spotify’s own take on simplified car controls&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon Music can be set to switch to Car Mode as soon as it recognizes your phone connecting to your car’s Bluetooth. For anyone with an older car, Car Mode can also be enabled in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS3wW3"&gt;Amazon Music might not be as popular as Spotify or Apple Music — it’s on its way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077187/amazon-music-service-55-million-customers-spotify-apple-music-prime-members"&gt;with over 55 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of January 2020 — but for a growing service that’s pretty easy to try if you’re already have an Amazon Prime subscription, any new feature has the possibility to help a lot of people. Car Mode is available in Amazon Music now on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipolo’s new One Spot Bluetooth tracker beats Apple’s AirTags to the punch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIcKFONp23D8j1_YE8vMKmPyj4c=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091226/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbliHC"&gt;The first Bluetooth tracker that can work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s vast Find My Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is here. But it’s not Apple’s long-anticipated AirTags tracker; it’s the &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-one-spot"&gt;Chipolo One Spot&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the company’s One tracker that’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu17x"&gt;Chipolo calls the One Spot a “special edition” product. While it has the same 12-month battery life (with replaceable battery), 120dB ring, water resistance, and overall design as the regular One tracker, the One Spot &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with Apple’s Find My network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Di4LZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple officially starts letting your iPhone help find lost third-party products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HscFen"&gt;That’s potentially an upgrade for anyone who already uses Apple products, given that a Bluetooth tracking tag is only as effective as the number of users who are on the same network. And while Chipolo has been around for a while, it’s still far smaller compared to more established players like Tile or the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bc0tl"&gt;The One Spot also features some Find My specific functionality, like a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-lost-mode-mmfc0f0165/icloud"&gt;Lost Mode&lt;/a&gt;” that allows users to tag an item as missing — which will, in turn, notify other Find My users if it’s found with a short message and a phone number to help you get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5j34u"&gt;It’s a sort of bewildering product, given the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple’s rumored AirTags tracker&lt;/a&gt; that’s potentially going to be released later in 2021, and it would similarly be a Find My-exclusive Bluetooth tag for keeping track of lost or missing items. Chipolo’s tracker lacks the rumored Ultra-WideBand radio support that Apple’s tag will reportedly feature for more precise tracking, but that aside, it’s hard to imagine what else Apple’s tag will bring to the table that’s not already available on the One Spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoWGI"&gt;Preorders for the Chipolo One Spot will start in May, with shipping planned for the beginning of June. No price has been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s first crack at a Clubhouse competitor is a new Q&amp;A platform called Hotline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1Q1yzgJNWkQS8Rg76fR8uh__2A=/11x0:1216x803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091193/Hotline_StoryHeader.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhkRYg"&gt;Facebook’s experimental app development division, the NPE Team, has released a new Q&amp;amp;A platform that borrows concepts from buzzy, audio-only social network Clubhouse but with dashes of live-streaming thrown in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrncyZ"&gt;The platform is called Hotline, and it featured its &lt;a href="https://hotline.co/nick-huber-ama"&gt;first Q&amp;amp;A with investor Nick Huber&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, according to a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A website for the service is online now and allows sign-ins via Twitter, but it features only a waitlist and a tool for applying to host your own show. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Facebook has created designs for mobile versions of the app, though those do not appear to be live at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9qTxS"&gt;News of Facebook building its own version of Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;first surfaced in February&lt;/a&gt;, though Hotline is said to be a different product than the ongoing Clubhouse competitor being built by the team behind the video chat platform Messenger Rooms, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports. Twitter has been openly testing its Spaces alternative, too, putting more pressure on Clubhouse as whispers of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/clubhouse-is-said-to-discuss-funding-at-about-4-billion-value"&gt;new funding round valuing the company at an eye-popping $4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt; surfaced earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aByTi5MopJNfcE7LjozN7wVTQds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427545/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_1.03.41_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTr0N"&gt;Hotline works differently than Clubhouse and Spaces. It allows hosts to use video and to schedule more formal presentations with Q&amp;amp;A built in, rather than the more open-ended, audio-only conversations that take place on Clubhouse. Hotline also allows hosts to record their sessions in both audio and video formats, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTZhyh"&gt;The core Q&amp;amp;A component of Hotline involves the hosts fielding questions from the audience supplied via text, while audience members can then upvote which questions they want answered and then respond to the ongoing conversation with emoji reactions. Hosts can also bring individuals from the audience up onto the virtual stage to ask their question live and potentially engage in a longer conversation. In that way, Hotline events seem designed more like a cross between a radio show and a Twitch stream, where the audience is asked to weigh in here and there but control of the conversation remains firmly with the host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c89qsF"&gt;The project is being led by Erik Hazzard, who joined Facebook when his app tbh, a platform for sending anonymous compliments to your friends, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16485428/facebook-tbh-to-be-honest-acquisition-ios-app"&gt;acquired in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528896/facebook-tbh-moves-hello-shut-down-low-usage"&gt;shut tbh down&lt;/a&gt;, despite Hazzard’s success attracting millions of users to the platform. But it sounds like his expertise in creating these new mobile experiences is now being put to good use at Facebook as part of the NPE Team, which in the past has released music-making apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174882/facebook-collab-app-store-release-date-price"&gt;Collab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303604/facebook-rap-app-bars-experiment"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KkmSX4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"},{"title":"Clubhouse’s new direct payments let you toss a coin to creators, and they get 100 percent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"},{"title":"Clubhouse announces accelerator program for creators on its platform","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>You can now play every classic Halo on Xbox with a mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcS1qO22j6FZ5NpU9KWWK9NXLLc=/0x0:1917x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090966/halo_mcc_update.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hJJp18"&gt;Today, you can fire up an Xbox game console and play &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard. It’s hard to believe I’m writing those words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT8wDK"&gt;Five years ago, I asked a small room of first-party Xbox devs how they felt about supporting mouse and keyboard (now that their boss Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/623516307137269760"&gt;had confirmed they were on the way&lt;/a&gt;), but they were seriously skeptical. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095086/xbox-one-keyboard-mouse-support-november-update-release"&gt;It took two more years&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox One to get even a handful of keyboard and mouse titles in a November 2018 update. Even though games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873038/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-cross-play-beta-how-it-works-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;COD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280358/fortnite-aim-assist-sypherpk-tfue-shooters-epic-games-fairness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have paved the way for controller parity, the industry is still understandably wary about mixing console and keyboard players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2q9OS"&gt;But now, keyboard and mouse is a native part of &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;(including &lt;em&gt;Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach,&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;as of a new April 2021 patch&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not alone: every Xbox that can play the game will let you adjust your field of view, crosshairs, and bind controls across multiple inputs, like any good competitive PC-grade shooter should. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkvmJb09LYPnoAYlrXSp7Z3Zvn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427494/chrome_ov27dewket.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glu1nG"&gt;Not only does that mean parity with PC, but it might actually make the Xbox version of &lt;em&gt;Halo: MCC &lt;/em&gt;preferable for some. As my colleague Tom Warren points out, it’s easier to avoid cheaters in console games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gw2HfB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;seeing mouse and keyboard support in Halo on Xbox makes me wish Destiny 2 had this. I’d switch immediately from PC, which is full of hackers, aimbots, and other exploits that ruin the PvP experience&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1379852440263143424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ2iAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;The full patch notes&lt;/a&gt; also mention new accessibility options, a new “Escalation Slayer” game variant, a new map for &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt;, and you can easily set your in-game chat and audio devices separately now on PC. And of course, there’s a new season of content dubbed “Raven.” &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/mcc-season-6-raven-has-landed"&gt;More info on that here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wbr4fA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImP5qjZQKNM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3siwE"&gt;Me, I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard almost since the beginning. The first copy I owned &lt;a href="https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/press_release/halo-pc-goes-gold/"&gt;was the Gearbox port for PC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a longtime favorite at LAN parties. Ah, do I miss LAN parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s speckled G15 brings high-end AMD Ryzen processors to value-minded gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G15 Ryzen Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlncbVhgpTl5ELQw8owsn-rw1cs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088327/g15lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Budget-friendly gaming laptops are looking better than ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfNhlU"&gt;Alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22131848"&gt;Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt;, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It’s for people who still want to experience AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5’s $1,793.98 starting price is too high, the G15’s $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1czH6"&gt;The G15’s speckled design might look familiar to you. That’s because Dell actually launched the Intel-based version of this model already, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319292/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-2021-announced-china-paint-speckles-specs"&gt;but in China first&lt;/a&gt;. This new Ryzen-based laptop is landing first in China as well, on April 30th, followed by a May 4th release elsewhere around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dw7cHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an Intel version, too, but it’s running last-gen chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKvJz"&gt;The starting configuration of the G15 Ryzen Edition will be fairly barebones in terms of RAM and storage, shipping with 8GB of 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and 256GB of NVMe M.2 capacity. It packs plenty of power otherwise for a $900 laptop, with a Ryzen 5 5600H hexa-core processor and an Nvidia RTX 3060 with 6GB of VRAM. In case you want something more powerful, the CPU be tweaked up to the Ryzen 7 5800H octa-core CPU, RAM can be added (either through Dell or by opening the laptop yourself), and you can configure it with up to 2TB of solid-state storage. The more powerful processor can also come with a bigger six-cell 86Wh battery, though you’ll get a three-cell 56Wh pack at the $900 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJfDip"&gt;At launch, the G15 can also be configured with a 120Hz refresh rate FHD panel at a fairly standard 250 nits of brightness, or a brighter 300-nit screen with a faster 165Hz refresh rate. Dell says a 360Hz refresh rate screen will be available later in the spring. Dell says the new G15 has adopted an “Alienware-inspired” thermal design to keep it running efficiently, and it certainly looks the part. It’ll come in at least two speckled colors at launch, a green and a grey. Later this year, an all-black model will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDa_LwrJ4rKWAvkVlxxAn-aydXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422232/g15ryzenlede.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G15 takes some cues from Alienware’s M15 series of much pricier gaming laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbdemy"&gt;This laptop ships by default with non-backlit, spill-resistant keyboard, but there are some upgrades you can make here. The first step up adds orange backlighting beneath the entire keyboard and emphasizes WASD. If orange doesn’t do it for you, there’s a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that you can customize for a more colorful presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb4zdQ"&gt;If the Ryzen Edition G15 is anything like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance, I’m excited to test it out. Assuming that it does, even the lower-end model should be reasonably powerful for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhgPX"&gt;If you really want the Intel version, Dell says a variant of it will launch in the US on April 13th for $799.99, but it’ll feature a last-gen 10th Gen Intel processor. Dell included this bit of information practically as a footnote, to give you an idea of how much emphasis it’s putting behind Ryzen this time around. The starting model features a Core i5-10200H quad-core CPU with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 graphics chip. Upgrading can net you the vastly more powerful Core i7-10870H octa-core CPU with the RTX 3060, and you can get Thunderbolt ports. Dell didn’t share the price for the high-end Intel model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Znvuns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Alienware lowered the starting price of its M15 R5 from $2,229.99 to $1,793.98, so I changed the price mentioned in the opening paragraph to reflect this update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
