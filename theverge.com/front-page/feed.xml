    <title>Razer’s updated Raptor 27 is a faster 165Hz monitor, now with optional VESA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27 gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0RJl8DCBo7fkiBZ4p48zacJDtI=/0x0:2824x1883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452284/raptor27_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Raptor 27 looks the same as the previous model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csB5o1"&gt;Razer has refreshed its minimalist Raptor 27 gaming monitor with &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync"&gt;FreeSync Premium&lt;/a&gt; support with low frame rate compensation for smoother gameplay; a slightly faster 165Hz refresh rate (the previous model topped out at 144Hz); and THX certification claiming to deliver great color, tone, and image accuracy. Like the 2019 version, this one has Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and its matte 27-inch QHD IPS panel covers 95 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0owe3d"&gt;This monitor will cost $799.99 when it releases in Q3 2021, which is $100 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18168800/razer-raptor-gaming-monitor-blade-advanced-nvidia-rtx-price-ces-2019"&gt;previous version&lt;/a&gt;. The improvements make it at least worth considering if you want to game on PC with enhanced variable refresh rate tech. That, and Razer’s Raptor 27 is tough to beat when it comes to design, with its sturdy aluminum base that lets the monitor flip 90 degrees for easy cable management. It’s undoubtedly a high price to pay, though, when some 4K gaming monitors cost just a little more. For $899, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer’s Nitro XV28&lt;/a&gt; has a 28-inch 4K IPS screen with HDMI 2.1 ports that support up to fast 120Hz refresh rate gaming on PC or the PS5 and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HMKPP"&gt;Razer now offers a VESA adapter for this Raptor 27 and the previous model. If you want to abandon the base that comes with the monitor, this adapter (also releasing in Q3 2021) costs $100 and will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or some other VESA base that you might prefer. This would have been a pretty appealing accessory to include with the refreshed monitor, particularly given that the new monitor &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; costs $100 more, but alas. There’s a good chance you might want to use the standard Chroma LED-lined base anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJLahf3-9FdwqzT6PdLQdW1lvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646033/raptor27_vesamount.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional VESA adapter will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or a different stand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx0ZEq"&gt;Outside of the tweaks I mentioned earlier, not much else is different here. The ports haven’t changed with this update. It still comes with an HDMI 2.0b port, a DisplayPort v1.4 port, a USB-C port with DisplayPort support, two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 passthrough ports, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer GaN charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/749QHsJoBa4lMIJ2SdHDmb7sljU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646040/razergan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charge up to four devices at once, with 130W of power to split.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1OYLjL"&gt;Razer has another E3 announcement, but it has little to do with gaming: it’s a $179.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/30/18203879/gan-chargers-anker-powerport-atom-pd-1-ravpower-45w"&gt;GaN charger&lt;/a&gt; that can supply up to 130W of total power. It’s worth noting that its two USB-C ports support up to 100W (not 130W as the name might seem to suggest), and the two USB Type-A ports can pull 18W each. If you have multiple devices plugged in at once, it’ll share the wattage between them, totaling up to 130W. The charger comes with some global adapters included, so it might be a good option for traveling, depending on where you’re going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bexVPR"&gt;Razer’s GaN charger isn’t the only 100W option on the market. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21311978/hyper-hyperjuice-charger-available-price-kickstarter-specs"&gt;HyperJuice’s similar-looking $100 charger&lt;/a&gt;, for one, and that company also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492491/hyperjuice-stackable-gan-charger-100-watts-kickstarter-available-now-pricing-release-date"&gt;these inventive 65W and 100W GaN chargers&lt;/a&gt; that can be stacked for more power and more ports. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a faster USB-C charger than 100W, but that could change in the future, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr"&gt;the new USB-C Release 2.1 spec supports up to 240W charging&lt;/a&gt;. Though, in the meantime, it won’t take much effort to find a more affordable GaN charger than Razer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 14 is the first Blade laptop with AMD Ryzen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses the Razer Blade 14 on a laptop stand connected to an external mechanical keyboard and monitor. The monitor screen displays a game; the laptop screen displays a Razer logo on a red, black, and green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1iiLqMLHuM8qPhAzCMO3_-g-_ws=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452290/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Gaming___3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Razer Blade 14.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwsSSQ"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_rogame/status/1374818024683941891"&gt;months&lt;/a&gt; of rumors and speculation, many gamers’ dreams have finally come true. Today, Razer has announced the new Razer Blade 14, which is powered by AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 5900HX. It’s the first Razer Blade to include an AMD processor, and it’s available for purchase now on Razer’s website starting at $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBIbHS"&gt;The 14-inch gaming rig will also feature up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and a QHD 165Hz display as well as an FHD 144Hz option. Razer says the Blade will be the smallest 14-inch gaming laptop on the market, with dimensions of 12.59 x 8.66 x 0.66 inches. There’s also a 720p webcam (which isn’t a given on gaming laptops these days).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHjZNa"&gt;The rest of the laptop looks like a fairly standard Razer Blade, including the signature per-key RGB keyboard and the triple-headed snake logo on the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An over-the-shoulder shot of a user typing on the Razer Blade 14. The screen displays the Razer logo on a red, green, and black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WrA-1ysW-5u9lfJbe8tDTcFC24=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658030/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Studio_1___Alt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check those keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NOeqoS"&gt;“As gamers demand lighter and more powerful form factors in gaming laptops, we have remained committed to our goal of delivering best-in-class mobile processors for premium OEM designs,” said Saeid Moshkelani, SVP and GM of AMD’s client business unit. “We are excited to collaborate with Razer, for the first time ever, by powering the Razer Blade 14 with the best mobile processors we have developed for gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user sits at an outdoor picnic table, typing on the Razer Blade 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H97zYVSErBgzRnbHMhWZRfZLALY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658021/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo we know and love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JCt3xf"&gt;Razer’s Intel systems have consistently ranked among our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; delivers excellent frame rates while remaining comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; is one of very few 13-inch gaming laptops that can run AAA titles at native resolution, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the most powerful performance you can find in a gaming laptop, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ypba6"&gt;But laptops with AMD CPUs have been doing better than those with Intel CPUs in recent years, in both performance and battery life. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;top two&lt;/a&gt; selections for the best gaming laptop are both AMD-powered, as is our best budget pick. Asus’ AMD-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the best performance and battery life that we’ve ever seen from a 14-inch laptop. It’s exciting to see Razer combining its top-notch build quality with these top-notch processors, and we’ll see how well it stacks up to Asus’ offerings once we’ve gotten our hands on the unit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil Village DLC is in the works after popular demand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvoNMq2o4XgsJhX58lp5Er8o8fg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452268/8GY4TWwGyghcgqoAnv7ka9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvWxgJ"&gt;Capcom has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be getting downloadable content. The news was revealed during an E3 2021 Showcase that was short of new announcements. A quick message during the livestream confirmed that DLC has entered production “by popular demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSFyN0"&gt;While there were no more details beyond this, the implication is that we could be getting more content featuring the game’s most popular character, Lady Dimitrescu. Another possibility could be the return of fan-favorite Ada Wong, who was originally planned to feature in &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, as revealed via early concept art that can be unlocked in the game. Of course, it could be a while before this additional DLC comes out, as it appears there had been no plans ahead of the game’s release, whereas &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; already had a season pass planned for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UWeYFt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Resident Evil Village has more guns but fewer scares","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xaeHHV"&gt;It was also confirmed that online multiplayer game &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil RE:Verse&lt;/em&gt; will be releasing next month, and is free for everyone who has purchased &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcjGxK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgD2L7v9jm4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj4D6o"&gt;Ahead of the Capcom E3 2021 Showcase, the publisher had said it would be focusing on updates on &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.&lt;/em&gt; And, true to its word, that’s exactly what we got. Nonetheless, it provided another emotionally charged story trailer for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2&lt;/em&gt;, and also confirmed that it will be getting free trial demo coming on June 25th. Players will also be able to carry save progress over to the full game when it launched on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8jLmA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doom now runs on an Ikea smart light bulb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/doToa5VyIG7OUP8vbbzSwsQ1NF0=/105x0:1239x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452209/Mounted_on_lamp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftNuKw"&gt;“Can it run Doom?” is a question nearly as old as &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;itself, as creative hardware hackers and software savants across the internet work to try and get the 1993 classic shooter to run on virtually anything that has a microprocessor. The latest absurd entry: an Ikea Trådfri GU10 345 RGB LED bulb, &lt;a href="https://next-hack.com/index.php/2021/06/12/lets-port-doom-to-an-ikea-tradfri-lamp/"&gt;which &lt;em&gt;Next-Hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has managed to hack into running a modified version of Doom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VN5zgq"&gt;The actual hack is a bit of a cheat, given the fact that unlike past Doom hack candidates, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611884/nintendo-game-and-watch-doom-port-hack-homebrew-games"&gt;Nintendo Game &amp;amp; Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611884/nintendo-game-and-watch-doom-port-hack-homebrew-games"&gt;the MacBook Pro Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/19/2719205/ndoom-ti-nspire-calculator-port-color-upgrade"&gt;TI calculator&lt;/a&gt;, the Trådfri bulb doesn’t have any buttons or a display. Next-Hack had to add those, using the MGM210L RF board that powers the “smart” part of the bulb, and modifying a copy of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; to run on its paltry 108kB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TE_NTW6KlbAH5PUSUDC7Pws3LVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658882/Mounted_on_lamp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://next-hack.com/index.php/2021/06/12/lets-port-doom-to-an-ikea-tradfri-lamp/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next-Hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ5aeJ"&gt;And even then, there’s a lot of impressive workarounds to get the actual game to run, including adding additional storage, getting audio to work, and the ever-tricky management of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kn6dK"&gt;For deeper technical details, it’s worth reading the full article, but the results speak for themselves — the processor has enough power to not only run &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, but run the modified version pretty well. Not bad for a light bulb. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2021) review: victory lap</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The newest Chromebook Spin 713 is just as good as last year’s model&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NeIr7b"&gt;Acer has made three significant upgrades to the best-in-class Chromebook Spin 713. The first is that the device now has Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. The second is that the USB-C ports both support Thunderbolt 4. And the third is that it now has an optional fingerprint reader (which isn’t available yet, but will be in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxVBEo"&gt;These aren’t the most revolutionary spec bumps in the world. The rest of the Spin 713 remains the same: it has a fantastic 3:2 touch display, a good backlit keyboard, a smooth touchpad, and good value for its premium components. But the changes add up. And they serve to push the Spin 713 even further ahead of its competition than it was before. It’s very much still the Chromebook to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYt9Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10515970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QmmuFb"&gt;The Spin 713’s standout feature is its 2256 x 1504 panel. It’s one of the best Chromebook screens I’ve ever used. Colors really pop, details are crisp, and it gets plenty bright. Though the screen is glossy, I rarely saw glare, and what I did see didn’t hinder my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2IL7D"&gt;But my favorite aspect of this display (and of this Chromebook as a whole) is the 3:2 aspect ratio. You get noticeably more vertical space than you would from a standard 16:9 display of a similar size. Less scrolling, less zooming out, more room for all your tabs and apps. I’m a fan of 3:2, and I’ve been happy to see more laptop models taking it up over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table angled to the right. The screen displays a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPGPEbVmpPQ9y9acEBBZGEtcTWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539425/mchin_20190815_4597_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screeeeeeeeen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ej4rpl"&gt;Another strength (which Acer has strengthened with this model) is the port selection. This is the first Chromebook to support Thunderbolt 4 — many premium Chromebooks don’t even support older Thunderbolt standards. There are not one, but two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left side of the Spin. This makes the Spin 713 one of the most affordable machines in the world to include Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj9KqG"&gt;The USB-C ports also support USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and 5V charging. Elsewhere, you get an HDMI port and a microSD reader, in addition to a headphone jack and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1. The Spin also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqeBowf_w4ShwO3xZtZ4yfWmZww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539428/mchin_20190815_4597_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, an HDMI, and an audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WT2cqj"&gt;The fingerprint reader also helps put the Spin 713 above premium competitors; the lack of biometric authentication was one of our very few knocks against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;last model&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor lives on the deck, beneath the arrow keys. It’s the same color as the Spin’s finish and is nicely camouflaged. (While our review unit had a fingerprint reader, that unit is not available for purchase as of this writing, and does not have a finalized price. Acer says it’s coming “soon”. Currently, you can only purchase Spin 713 units without a fingerprint reader, but I’ll update this article when that changes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pUqFQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fh6u"&gt;The Spin’s keyboard and touchpad are also quite good. The keyboard is comfortable and backlit, though I wish the keys didn’t feel quite so plasticky. The touchpad is smooth, accurate, and quite large.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR0Pbl"&gt;Like its predecessor, this Spin 713 has two main drawbacks. The first is that its audio is thin, and I heard a bit of distortion at maximum volume. The second is that the Spin’s aesthetic is utilitarian. The finish is somewhat drab, and the screen bezels are chunky. I wouldn’t call it ugly, but it’s something that would fit in on a school laptop cart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv7Fo6"&gt;That said, the Spin is also fairly sturdy, with an aluminum chassis, and feels better made than many plasticky devices you’ll find at this price point. The 360 hinge is easy to flip around, and I only saw a tiny bit of screen wobble while I was typing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table seen from the back, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUlNw1Z4uLk7bo8DZzVng0FPszc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539435/mchin_20190815_4597_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny bit of screen wobble, but I’ve seen much worse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open seen from the front. The screen dispalys a blue gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sG7NaRy6OP-4keVOTxJQ2YnRg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539424/mchin_20190815_4597_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is flipped around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m78SAc"&gt;Performance is the other area where the new Spin 713 is supposed to have gotten major upgrade. My review model is $699.99 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. This is the primary configuration that Acer will be selling to start, but more will be coming in August with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTXKWE"&gt;The Spin is the first Chromebook to be certified through Intel’s Evo program, which is meant to recognize the best portable Intel laptops on the market. The Spin did everything I needed it to, including editing big batches of photos and running multiple demanding apps at a time on top of Zoom calls and Spotify streams, quite fast and without any performance issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCul6z"&gt;That was also true of last year’s Spin 713. What’s new this year is that I’m hearing the fans. Last year’s model was very quiet, but the fans were almost constantly spinning in this model. The noise wasn’t always annoying, but it was often audible. This makes me anxious about the Spin 713’s ability to cool a Core i7, so even if Acer sells a Core i7 model later this year, I’d recommend that most people stick with a Core i5 model unless you know you need an i7. (The Core i5’s performance here is going to be enough for 90 percent of people.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIw31_xsHSOOhxm36KdS26bgk4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539434/mchin_20190815_4597_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t feel much heat in the keyboard, so the fans were doing their job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUmKAy"&gt;What’s also gotten a bit worse is battery life: I averaged seven hours and 29 minutes of consistent work with the screen at 50 percent brightness, running some trials with a bunch of Android apps and some trials just in Chrome. That’s about an hour worse than what I averaged on the previous model, though both results are respectable for this price. The battery took 55 minutes to juice from zero to 60 percent with light Chrome use, which is a bit slower than last year’s model (but close). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M6rdI"&gt;The Spin 713 runs Chrome OS, as all Chromebooks do. It supports all Android apps via Google Play. Everything ran smoothly on this system, in both clamshell and tablet modes. Many Chrome OS apps have improved since I used them on last year’s 713. Slack, for example, was crashing all over the place last year, and is technically usable now. That said, I still generally find that most of my preferred services (Messenger, Slack, Reddit, Instagram, the like) are equivalent or better experiences in browser form. I do like being able to offload distractions like Spotify and Twitter into their own apps so I don’t have them mixed in with my Chrome tabs, but that’s about as far as my typical use of Android apps on a Chromebook goes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right palm rest of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCEEfDcuPBYdqsyygiJbL8euOLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539431/mchin_20190815_4597_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could totally miss the fingerprint reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint on the Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0Zoir_fGe62UULibEolF_NxKZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539430/mchin_20190815_4597_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uKvCh0"&gt;As was the case with its predecessor, the Spin 713 isn’t a perfect Chromebook. It’s also not cheap as far as Chromebooks go. But it offered unbeatable value last year, and its value has gotten even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="t0LT9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGwDNu"&gt;To illustrate just how much this device is offering for its $699 price, look to the premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. To buy a Pixelbook Go with an 8th Gen Core i5 (which is now an old chip), 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (half of what you get in this Spin configuration), you’d be paying &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixelbook_go?hl=en-US"&gt;$849&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixelbook does have some advantages over the Spin, of course: you’re getting better build quality, a lighter chassis, and slightly better audio. But the Pixelbook has no biometric authentication, it has very few ports and doesn’t support Thunderbolt 4, it’s 16:9, and it’s not a convertible. It’s miles behind in almost every other way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MWJtoI"&gt;In other words, if you don’t mind a laptop-cart look, the Chromebook Spin 713 is an incredible value. The more power-hungry processor has changed the calculus slightly, but so have the new features. And ultimately, the Spin still comes out on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLL2ec"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnTLel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 14th 5:38PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Acer confirmed after the original publication of this review that the Chromebook Spin 713 that’s currently available to purchase does not have a fingerprint scanner on it, even though our review sample does. A model with a fingerprint scanner is expected to come later this year, but the company has not finalized a price or release date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Turtle Beach is making dedicated flight sim hardware for PC and Xbox consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B3qi0f5R1SWbSJIM4OnzRZWQMgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451518/tb_velocityone_flight.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sure, it costs nearly as much as a Series X, but look at it!&lt;/em&gt; | Turtle Beach&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VQuya2"&gt;Gaming peripheral company Turtle Beach announced at E3 2021 that it’s getting into a new product category: flight sim hardware. The company is launching the VelocityOne Flight system for $350, and it’s compatible with PC and Xbox consoles via USB. And, for a first effort in this competitive space, it seems like a very comprehensive offering and a decent value if you’re into playing &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VV2eqt"&gt;The VelocityOne Flight was made in collaboration with aeronautical engineers and pilots to provide a realistic flight experience. It has a 180-degree yoke handle with rear rudder controls for easy access. To its right, there’s a modular throttle quadrant with an integrated trim wheel, as well as both vernier-style and lever controls (with swappable tops for prop and jet planes). All in all, Turtle Beach says the VelocityOne Flight features 12 analog axes, two POV switches, two four-way HAT switches, and 18 extra buttons that can be mapped to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach VelocityFlight One" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oj2u8CxqZwCsPi8Gzl2KadW7q9A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657812/velocityflightone_screen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BRmCZz"&gt;In addition to controls, this hardware includes a 3.5mm jack on its left side for private listening. To deepen immersion (and to avoid having to push multiple buttons when you just want to fly and chill) the yoke has a display that can show stats like flight time, time at destination, and more. There’s a panel that can show other indicators, like real-time alerts, landing lights, landing gear, and more (though Turtle Beach says some of these features will be added later by software and firmware updates). This hardware doesn’t feature force feedback or rumble.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8U8944UrW87x8KiQjhaVnAKBIc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657814/pov_hat_switches.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A zoomed-in look at the POV and HAT switches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J58Hp7"&gt;CEO Juergen Stark said in a press release that this hardware “provides everything a new flier needs, along with the capability and features that hardcore flight simmers want.” In case you were curious, Turtle Beach says this hardware will work with other flight simulators — not just Microsoft’s latest one that’s available now on PC and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22527483/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-launch"&gt;coming later to console on July 27th&lt;/a&gt;. This hardware has a release window targeted for the summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Turtle Beach Recon controller" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz5RkceKzLXhDPe0_pO9Un7ChiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657785/tb_recon_controller.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dvfphu"&gt;The company is also releasing its first traditional controller for the Xbox Series X / S called the Recon Controller. It’s an intimidating-looking $60 wired model, and what makes it special is its audio chops. If you plug any set of headphones into its 3.5mm jack, you can turn on mic monitoring and swap through audio presets to modify how your game sounds. You’ll also have the option to use Turtle Beach’s Superhuman Hearing feature usually found in its own headsets, which amplifies easy-to-miss sounds that might give you the edge in a game. There are also buttons to adjust the game and chat audio mixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKcfYX"&gt;In addition, the sensitivity of the analog sticks can be tweaked and different profiles can be saved to one of the controller’s mappable quick-action buttons located on the rear. Its directional pad supports eight-way input, and its 10-foot braided cable is attached via USB-C to the controller. It’s also coming out sometime this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After saving Tuca &amp; Bertie, Adult Swim has posted the first episode of season 2 on YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym4e_UyC3fj0-yq9zOPLWMPLCqI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451428/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_12.48.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adult Swim&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gm76j9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie &lt;/em&gt;is back on the air thanks to Adult Swim, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWIhZ0R2H7M"&gt;watch the entire first episode of season 2 for free&lt;/a&gt; on Adult Swim’s YouTube channel right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dd86Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tuca &amp;amp; Bertie&lt;/em&gt; is an animated show from &lt;em&gt;BoJack Horseman &lt;/em&gt;producer and artist Lisa Hanawalt starring Tiffany Haddish and Ali Wong as two best friends navigating their adult lives. The show first premiered on Netflix in 2019 and debuted to rave reviews, but the streaming service canceled it after just one season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLomgV"&gt;In 2020, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267667/tuca-and-bertie-season-two-adult-swim-netflix-renewed-saved-bojack-horseman-lisa-hanawalt"&gt;Adult Swim picked up a 10-episode order of the show&lt;/a&gt;. The first episode of that new season premiered Sunday night, and if you missed the debut or just want to check out the show for yourself, you can catch it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X04lZa"&gt;If you watch this first episode and want to catch up on the series, you’ll have to subscribe to Netflix, as the first season is only available on the streaming service. New episodes air on Adult Swim on Sundays at 11:30PM ET / PT. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube is banning alcohol, gambling, and politics from its ‘most prominent’ ad slot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16VGS100QPvwsHwyHyNlRgnX-Cg=/0x0:2109x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69451248/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.36.07_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the YouTube masthead ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oaWGXa"&gt;YouTube will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/adspolicy/answer/10249050"&gt;no longer be accepting ads&lt;/a&gt; relating to alcohol, gambling, politics, or “prescription drug terms” for its masthead ad slot, which appears at the top of the website and app, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/youtube-masthead-advertising-ban-9b8d3f1c-f0e4-4520-bcad-fa2e1e46b1a5.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. Google told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the limitations on what kind of ads can appear in this slot will help “lead to a better experience for users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1drIW"&gt;The masthead slot is one of the first things users see when they open YouTube, so it’s understandable that keeping ads about drugs, alcohol, or gambling out of it would make YouTube more inclusive for everyone. As for politics, it could help the platform avoid controversies, like the one that arose when then-President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/02/youtube-will-end-full-day-masthead-reservations-like-trump-used.html"&gt;purchased the slot for three days&lt;/a&gt; during the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="RDZJbV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9709826"&gt;YouTube’s ad support page&lt;/a&gt;, ads in the masthead slot can “drive massive reach or awareness,” but now that megaphone will no longer be available to people wanting to advertise in certain spaces. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168280/google-ad-policy-gambling-alcohol-ban-limit-monetization"&gt;already provides a way&lt;/a&gt; for users to limit the number of alcohol and gambling-related ads they see on YouTube, and in theory the setting would’ve applied to the masthead ad — according to Google, last year the company changed the slot to show targeted ads, rather than ones that had been reserved for an entire day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fQYZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2003/12/01/google-to-limit-some-drug-ads/070b7462-815d-47e1-9600-7af29ee871da/"&gt;For years&lt;/a&gt; Google has tried to balance its policies to determine what it does and doesn’t show in ads — recently, it’s reined in ads that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375702/google-updates-youtube-ad-targeting-hate-speech"&gt;used hate speech as keywords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21456323/google-election-ad-ban-donald-trump-early-victory"&gt;political misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328526/google-coronavirus-conspiracy-page-ad-ban-new-rule"&gt;conspiracy theories&lt;/a&gt; around COVID-19. As it’s worked to clean up what ads it puts in front of users, Google’s ads business has also increasingly come under scrutiny from lawmakers who believe it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;ripe for antitrust enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>At $299, DJI’s leaked Mini SE might be its most affordable drone yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHbYUXc2ks17n0PqqfNgqzz5GeQ=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450874/dji_mini_se_upscale.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z7ffSb"&gt;We called the DJI Mini 2 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the best drone you can buy under $500&lt;/a&gt;, but what if you don’t have $449 to spend? Walmart has leaked a new entry in DJI’s Mavic Mini line that might start at just $299, which should make it the company’s most affordable drone ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBM3ZV"&gt;Not only did we just find that price &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDJI-Mini-SE%2F550297208&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt;, it’s apparently migrated to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321"&gt;at least one set&lt;/a&gt; of Walmart store shelves already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qulh2J"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/agxlPAF1Pb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/agxlPAF1Pb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Güçlü Atamer (@GAtamer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GAtamer/status/1403392256770445321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h7uihJ"&gt;Here’s the thing, though: as far as we can tell, this &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; actually a less-expensive DJI Mini 2 — it appears to be a less-expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20938530/dji-mavic-mini-price-specs-faa-ultra-light-combo-pack"&gt;first-gen DJI Mavic Mini&lt;/a&gt;, a drone from 2019. As &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/06/03/dji-mini-se-shows-up-on-wal-mart-but-is-it-really-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DroneDJ&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, all the specs seem to line up with the original Mavic Mini, including its lower-res 2.7K-resolution camera (compare to 4K) and its inferior 2.5-mile wireless range, which strongly suggests the Mini SE doesn’t have Ocusync. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agXzeg"&gt;As Vjeran discusses in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our Mini 2 review&lt;/a&gt;, the Ocusync wireless link is perhaps the biggest reason to pick it over the Mavic Mini. It’s not just range: Ocusync is far more reliable and responsive, too. And though Walmart’s online images &lt;em&gt;seem&lt;/em&gt; to suggest the DJI Mini SE might come with the Mini 2’s new-and-improved controller, the back of Walmart’s in-store reservation card makes it look like you’re still getting the original folding pad:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8iFakTe01wt8lbuYAH0Oak-Dsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658224/mini_se_back_card_reddit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/" target="_blank"&gt;u/Mr_DMoody&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can make out a tiny image of the old folding controller at lower left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fHZH2A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dji/comments/ns235y/what_the_link_in_first_comment/h0mc6tp/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;As internet sleuths are pointing out&lt;/a&gt;, it looks like the primary differences here are simply a $100 lower price and a slightly improved plastic chassis, which may or may not make it compatible with the Mini 2’s batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3GltUl"&gt;Bargain hunters will know that $299 isn’t completely unheard of for a DJI drone — I’ve seen refurbished and closeout Phantom 3 Standard kits for $299, and I believe there was a one-time $299 deal on the Mavic Mini. But if the DJI Mini SE actually retails for $299, that’d be a deal right out of the gate. It’d be extremely tempting to would-be drone buyers looking for something they can easily stuff in a bag and (at sub-249g) one they won’t need to register with the FAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xhVsu9"&gt;It’s not clear when the Mini SE might go on sale. DJI declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s everything we know about Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iD1UgiaImJ8gb9ulk_fXtCx5p-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69450387/HaloInfinite_613_HERO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bnoYCU"&gt;343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531861/halo-infinite-e3-2021-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;gave us a first glimpse at Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer&lt;/a&gt; mode yesterday, and now we’re getting even more information on how the weapons, armor, and sandbox experience will work. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC later this year, allowing friends to play the free multiplayer mode across multiple platforms using crossplay and cross-progression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VTOIE"&gt;The free multiplayer mode will also include a battle pass that never expires after you’ve purchased it. We don’t know how much the battle pass will cost yet, but &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;players will be able to purchase old season passes and choose which battle pass to focus progression toward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXAAVP"&gt;343 Industries is leaning heavily into armor, weapon, and vehicle customizations, without random loot or loot boxes. The battle pass will provide armor and presumably more, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; players will also be able to play to earn customizations that even include customizing a character’s voice or adding prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gc2DyfEH7q65-PnWN5EQEtjHAiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657838/yN0PNvJ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 343 Industries&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Armor customizations in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="80Ozhi"&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YNg1vk"&gt;“There will be millions of customization combinations for Spartans on the battlefield,” explains Ryan Paradis, a live design director at 343 Industries. Armor customizations will include different coatings, emblems, effects, and all the typical armor pieces like your shoulders, gloves, kneepads, helmet, and visor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVE7E0"&gt;Weapons will also include a variety of customizations, and even vehicles will get customization options, too. Players will be able to customize each item in-game or through the Halo Waypoint website and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHBb8t"&gt;A lot of customizations are unlocked through playing the game, and only through playing. All of the customizations are purely cosmetic, and each season will introduce new looks that players can collect. 343 Industries hasn’t revealed whether different sets of armor will have different sets of power.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0vW4xBEfm9HT4RXp2xmuKHnvFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657860/grapplehook.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s grappling hook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hQBidm"&gt;Weapons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kKuCsY"&gt;Classic &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;weapons are returning, including an assault rifle, battle rifle, gravity hammer, needler, plasma pistol, and even sticky plasma grenades. There will be a variety of heavy weapons, with one demonstrated in the trailer that can take out vehicles. Dual-wielding won’t be supported at launch, but 343 Industries &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/halo-infinite-wont-have-dual-wielding-at-launch/"&gt;isn’t ruling it out entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJBIcX"&gt;343 Industries revealed how combat works in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Equipment is returning with &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and you can use the new grappling hook for tactical play and combine it with other equipment to complete objectives. The grappling hook can also be used for mobility to move quickly around a map or to grab weapons and throwable objects. Other players can also pick up items like your overshield during play, and even choose when to use them instead of instant activation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y3JRdu"&gt;Vehicles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="A6Mvwi"&gt;Vehicles are a big part of the battle arena in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. A new Razorback vehicle can carry additional weapons at the rear, and it’s designed to be a cousin of the classic Warthog. The Warthog will be available in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s part of a number of vehicles that will be delivered by Pelicans instead of spawning at bases. Weapon pods, like the &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt; days, will also drop during combat for resupplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIKS6a"&gt;Using a vehicle will come at a risk, though. A Warthog’s wheels can be blown off from damage, and vehicles catch fire after a certain damage threshold. That means you have to choose when to ditch a vehicle wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/puxfN6YOW6243iWtMWLW0AYRqYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22657855/vehicleshaloinfinite.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vehicles in Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RVnyLT"&gt;Academy and training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QjwFua"&gt;If you’re new to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, there’s even an academy mode to let people get used to the look, feel, and terminology of the game. &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is using bots in a separate training and tutorial area, with a variety of difficulty levels so they can also be used as training partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkVxDr"&gt;This area is a separate map to the environments we’ve seen in the trailers. It’s not clear how many maps will be available in Halo Infinite yet, but we’ve seen both outdoor and indoor maps that offer the variety of close combat or distance and vehicle usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LxB6Z"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is launching simultaneously on PC and Xbox, crossplay and cross-progression will be included at launch. On Xbox Series X, the arena mode will support up to 120fps, and on the PC side there will be support for ultrawide monitors, triple keybinds, advanced graphics options, and other customizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1e6Vj"&gt;343 Industries hasn’t provided a deep dive on how it plans to balance crossplay controller vs. mouse and keyboard, but there will be input-based matchmaking for the ranked parts of the game. The studio has also &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-april-2021"&gt;committed to a server-side anti-cheat system&lt;/a&gt;, which includes spotting hackers based on their behavior in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxTBgh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; launches in the fall on Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC. A “technical preview” will be available later this summer, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-insider"&gt;sign up at the Halo Waypoint site&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to get access.&lt;/p&gt;
