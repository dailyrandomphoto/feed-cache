    <title>Netflix’s Midnight Mass is more slow-burning horror from the creator of Hill House</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SwUUA0lKv3HbIwufVDHKgZhOJZw=/467x0:3134x1778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882657/mm_103_sdr_co3_00180401R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSwqbc"&gt;Throughout the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; anthology, creator Mike Flanagan has carved out a very particular brand of horror. Both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hill House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are slow and methodical, with intricate stories that carefully weave together ghostly scares with family drama. Their small scope keeps them focused. Flanagan’s latest, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;, isn’t part of that anthology, though in many ways it feels like it is. It has the same patient build-up, the intense focus on family dynamics, and even some of the same cast. But &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; also increases the scope — and the scares. Instead of a single family home, its story encompasses a small fishing village, and instead of ghosts it’s more about monsters. It takes a bit to get going, but by the end it descends into pure and gruesome horror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKslxy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; takes place on Crockett Island, colloquially known as Crock Pot, an isolated island with a population of just over a hundred residents. There are two important things to know about the island. First, it’s going through a steady decline years after an oil spill decimated the local fishing industry. Second, it’s a very religious place, with St. Patrick’s Church serving as the de facto center of town. At the outset of the show, the big island drama has to do with the aging local priest, who went on a pilgrimage and returned sick, and is now resting in a hospital on the mainland. A mysterious, young Father Paul (Hamish Linklater) arrives to temporarily take his place. Paul reinvigorates the island’s community, turning the church into the bustling, vibrant place it once was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uweCs"&gt;Around the time he arrives, weird things start happening. One day, dozens of dead cats wash up on a beach. Later, a resident swears he saw the old priest going for a walk in the middle of a deadly storm. Stranger still are the miracles: aging residents start to regain their youth, and a young girl stands up from her wheelchair and walks in order to receive communion. All of these seemingly disparate developments are connected to the show’s big twist, which reveals itself about halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SKxZUz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HbT4PN"&gt;Like most small town mysteries, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is an ensemble. The story starts out with Riley Flynn (Zach Gilford), a former altar boy who left the island, only to return after a stint in jail for a deadly DUI that continues to haunt him. He’s joined by childhood friend Erin Greene (Kate Siegel), who is similarly back on Crockett after a lifetime away from the island, now pregnant and living in her mother’s old house, while working her old job at the local school. There’s also the town sheriff Hassan (Rahul Kohli), a former NYPD officer and seemingly the only non-Christian on the island; Bev (Samantha Sloyan), the archetypal judgy religious type who helps run the church and guilts people into attending; town doctor Sarah (Annabeth Gish) who is struggling to explain what’s happening to her patients; and Riley’s parents (Henry Thomas and Kristin Lehman) who are just trying to keep it together as they take in their troubled adult son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bk4Fmh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Haunting of Bly Manor is a puzzle box disguised as a ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"},{"title":"Haunting of Hill House is like This Is Us wrapped in a gothic ghost story","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17911720/haunting-of-hill-house-review-netflix-shirley-jackson-mike-flanagan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc4UPD"&gt;Even though there’s a lot to keep track of, you’ll get to know these characters intimately over the show’s seven episodes, because if there’s one thing the residents of Crockett love more than anything, it’s talking. A huge portion of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;’ run-time is dedicated to dialogue. You’ll hear long sermons from the new priest, intense and revelatory AA meetings, and too many childhood stories to count. Everyone seems to preface their thoughts with a monologue of some kind. The show is almost like a nesting doll of stories. It can border on overload at times, though it helps that the performances are uniformly great. As much as I wanted to see what happened next, I couldn’t help but get pulled into long, drawn-out speeches about death and the meaning of life. These moments also help set the tone. So much of the show is quiet and thoughtful, which makes the dark moments hit really hard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Eike Schroter / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BViZwf"&gt;And there are some &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; dark moments. In its first few episodes, &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; feels a lot like the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; shows. There aren’t really jump scares or bloody kills. It’s the kind of horror that you watch through your fingers anticipating something terrible happening … only it rarely does. Eventually the show lets loose in a big, bloody way. It’s gradual — a few deaths here, some horrifying revelations there — but by the end &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; descends into full-blown horror. Like, we’re-on-the-run-because-we’re-all-gonna-die kind of horror. Gruesome-killfest-that-will-keep-you-up-at-night kind of horror. And it’s all the more horrifying because of how the show slowly ramps up, and how connected you feel to the main characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kk2knT"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; is how it manages to balance those more contemplative elements of the &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt; series — serious reflections on grief and guilt, faith and family — with more traditional horror elements. It doesn’t lose what made Flanagan’s past work so successful. Instead it twists it into something larger, more unsettling, and a whole lot scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwoW8F"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Midnight Mass &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;starts streaming on Netflix on September 24th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic’s high-fashion collaboration with Balenciaga in Fortnite includes a hoodie for a walking dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCO1qp6RpakOtM7Sc3qGQ_aPfL8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882491/18BR_Textile_UGC_Social_Store_front.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s Doggo in a hoodie.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYX8go"&gt;Epic Games is partnering with fashion house Balenciaga to bring the first-ever high-fashion &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins into the game. But the two companies aren’t just working on virtual clothes. They’re also partnering on an in-game Balenciaga-themed hub and a real-world clothing line that you’ll be able to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEgp5H"&gt;There will be four new skins, which you can see in the below photo, and each will have alternate styles. Epic is also planning to sell other Balenciaga-themed accessories, including &lt;a href="https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/men/shoes/speed"&gt;a pickaxe based on the Speed Sneaker&lt;/a&gt; and Balenciaga backpack back blings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jtVxy7fjhqRGYAhhdsScQ1zA50k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858219/feed_FB_1920x1080.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The new Balenciaga-themed skins coming to &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TD1hPo"&gt;The new gear will be available both in in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; usual in-game storefront and in the Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” Creative hub, which includes a virtual Balenciaga store where you can buy the cosmetics. Below is a preview of what that area looks like — there’s even an in-game animated billboard above the virtual store featuring the walking dog Doggo in the hoodie. That billboard will show up in the real world, too, in Tokyo, London, Seoul, and New York City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7t15ZPyxr-2q0KUn1gDXcUjRvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858262/body_img_FB_8__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strange Times hub with a virtual Balenciaga store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ph5oY"&gt;And if you love the hoodie Doggo is wearing, you’ll be able to buy it and a number of other items, including crew neck shirts, T-shirts, and hats, as part of the real-world &lt;em&gt;Fortnite-&lt;/em&gt;themed Balenciaga collection. Those clothes will go on sale on Monday or Tuesday, depending on your location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1MVXUs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10762775"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQShfR"&gt;Epic isn’t the first video game to collaborate with a fashion house. Gucci partnered with Roblox on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440134/gucci-garden-roblox-experience-metaverse-date"&gt;surreal virtual garden&lt;/a&gt; in May, for example, while Louis Vuitton made skins for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;characters in Riot Games’ &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Balenciaga itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;made a video game&lt;/a&gt; to debut its Fall 2021 collection that was made in Unreal Engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYWvkl"&gt;But the pairing of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and high fashion is an obvious one given how important virtual outfits are to the culture of the game. “&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is fashion,” Adam Sussman, president of Epic Games, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The entire experience of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is centered around self expression, player agency, and the ability to live out a fantasy of portraying characters and outfits that people want to wear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YYy5lo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Fortnite is fashion.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZ3XBu"&gt;He has a point; when I play &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, I’m constantly shuffling through different outfits and accessories to fit my mood or to create fun mashups. (Such as, say, having Master Chief wield Kratos’ Leviathan Axe while &lt;em&gt;The Madalorian’s&lt;/em&gt; Grogu floats behind him.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P756pC"&gt;The partnership between Epic and Balenciaga also could be a preview of how Unreal Engine is used to create virtual and real-world experiences in the future. That animated Doggo billboard that will appear in-game and in actual cities, for example, was made in Unreal Engine and reused assets created as part of Epic and Balenciaga’s collaboration. It seems likely that we’ll see Epic doing similar transmedia pushes for other &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; partnerships down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cO4YWE"&gt;Epic didn’t commit to if or when we might see other fashion collaborations, but it sounds like it’s definitely a possibility. “I think this is just the start,” said Emily Levy, who works on partnerships at Epic. “I think what’s really special about what we can do with our technology and with our community is create new ways for players to self-express [and] also new ways for players to experience fashion. I think you’re going to continue to see us explore what those two opportunities can look like for our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCOH43"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA1Uf7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UEHKoO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gq5gY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash expands alcohol delivery to 20 states, Canada and Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htIpR5tZtJ5GuCT34Kd5V4snmYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882358/acastro_190724_1777_doordash_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DoorDash is expanding its alcohol deliveries | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ovN7Np"&gt;Food delivery platform DoorDash said Monday it’s expanding its &lt;a href="https://get.doordash.com/en-us/business/alcohol"&gt;alcohol delivery&lt;/a&gt; service to 20 new states and the District of Columbia, Canada, and Australia, which it says will reach 100 million adults worldwide. Before the pandemic the company was only delivering in California and started expanding within the last six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyAGkI"&gt;“Customers in select markets, where legally permissible, can toggle to the Alcohol tab of the DoorDash app to browse and safely order from a wide selection of drinks from restaurants, grocery stores, local retailers, and convenience stores,” the company said in a press release. DoorDash cited a&lt;a href="https://restaurant.org/downloads/pdfs/research/soi/2020-state-of-the-industry-factbook.pdf"&gt; 2020 study&lt;/a&gt; from the National Restaurant Association that found 56 percent of customers over 21 would order alcoholic beverages if offered as part of food delivery from a restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ber9re"&gt;The feature is only available to customers 21 and older and requires ID verification: once at checkout, and again by the delivery driver at the door. DoorDash says it will blur out identifying information on users’ IDs except for the photo and date of birth, according to its &lt;a href="https://help.doordash.com/consumers/s/article/How-is-my-age-verified-for-alcohol-orders?language=en_US"&gt;customer support&lt;/a&gt; page. This means that customers won’t be able to have a totally contactless delivery if they order alcohol, and DoorDash encourages customers to wear masks when interacting with its drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObUHMM"&gt;During the height of the pandemic last year as many restaurants closed to in-person dining, some states, including New York, temporarily relaxed rules around alcohol delivery, providing many eateries with a needed revenue source. When then-Gov. Cuomo lifted the state of emergency in June of this year, the &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/6/23/22547565/new-york-takeout-cocktail-program-ends-june-24"&gt;delivery of alcoholic beverages was also ended&lt;/a&gt;, to the chagrin of many restaurants.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQQeOX"&gt;But delivery services, even as they tangle with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"&gt;state and local laws&lt;/a&gt; requiring them to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"&gt;share information&lt;/a&gt; with restaurants and generally treat them more fairly, see alcohol delivery as a lucrative revenue stream. In February, DoorDash competitor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262155/uber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates"&gt;Uber Eats acquired alcohol delivery service Drizly&lt;/a&gt; in a deal worth $1.1 billion. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620267/uber-gopuff-ftc-investigation-drizly-delivery"&gt;deal has drawn scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; from the US Federal Trade Commission, however, which is apparently concerned the acquisition could hamper competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1WyNI"&gt;Also on Monday, DoorDash also announced partnerships with &lt;a href="http://Responsibility.org"&gt;Responsibility.org&lt;/a&gt;, a non-profit focused on eliminating drunk driving and underage drinking, and Students Against Drunk Driving (SADD), which is focused on the same issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q6Ay2m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"DoorDash sues New York City over law that requires it to share customer data with restaurants","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675517/doordash-sues-new-york-city-law-delivery-share-customer-data-restaurants"},{"title":"DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats sue New York City over restaurant fee caps","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22666455/doordash-grubhub-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-restaurant-fee-caps-lawsuit"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="avx56Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 20th 9:51AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds detail that contactless delivery isn’t available for alcohol orders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest Apple TV 4K is $30 off through Apple’s refurbished store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y7O1ofJuyglKiYYTycs426sVjZ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882338/DSCF3875_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IKgChC"&gt;If you’ve been waiting on a deal for the latest Apple TV, which has a faster processor and includes the new Siri remote, &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/694936/7613?subId1=VergeDeals092021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFXH02LL%2FA%2Frefurbished-apple-tv-4k-64gb-2nd-generation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can save $30 on it by buying refurbished&lt;/a&gt; through Apple itself via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15288430-apple-tv-4k-current-model-149-apple-certified-refurbished?src=frontpage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The 32GB model costs $149 (was $179) and the 64GB model is $169 (was $199), but supplies are likely limited. While buying refurbished usually comes with a few words of caution, Apple’s refurbished program ensures that products are in brand-new condition, with a full one-year manufacturer warranty. It even supports AppleCare, so you can extend the warranty if you’d like. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SfISDS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10762987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QmY4C3"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Pro Review: semi-pro|100099" data-volume-uuid="15b8c43b5" data-volume-id="100099" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-152" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LMlZAR"&gt;Another great deal comes from Woot, where you can find the best price yet for Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds. These debuted earlier this year for $200, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-10%3Fref%3Dw_gw_dd_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but you can get them for $135 right now in silver or black&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other Woot deals on Samsung earbuds, these come with a one-year warranty. According to Chris Welch, who reviewed them, these are Samsung’s best earbuds yet in terms of sound quality. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="90YhyS"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 smart display, with an eight-inch display and a built-in camera, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCCOFsOFfW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $64 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This deal loops in the first-gen model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The newer $130 second-gen model that was released this summer&lt;/a&gt; has it beat when it comes to camera quality and overall performance, though it has a similar design, with no noticeable changes to the display or the speaker quality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cdPqxa"&gt;Samsung’s speedy X5 portable SSD with 1TB of storage and Thunderbolt 3 support is cheaper than ever at Amazon. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is the first time it has fallen below its usual $350 price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBWZJFG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can pick it up now for $300&lt;/a&gt;.

If you connect it to a laptop that has a Thunderbolt port, you can expect very fast read and write speeds. In my testing, this drive achieved an average 2,410MB/s read speed and 1,708MB/s write speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2KATE4"&gt;Atlus is celebrating the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Persona &lt;/em&gt;franchise this month, and perhaps it’s no coincidence that Walmart is selling the latest game in that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;franchise, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPersona-5-Royal-Sega-PlayStation-4-Physical-Edition%2F298470678&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Persona 5 Royal&lt;/em&gt;, for $25&lt;/a&gt;. It’s usually $60 and packs in a ton of content. This game works on PS4, and can be played on PS5 consoles that have a disc drive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199604/persona-5-royal-review-ps4-atlus-rpg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s latest update is making free live TV even easier to stream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KB-bDcGSguqV9P1n8IqW53A2aok=/234x0:966x488/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882220/Roku_OS_10.5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roku’s live TV app displayed on the home screen in Roku OS 10.5.&lt;/em&gt; | Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GM8kE5"&gt;Roku is making finding stuff to watch more of a breeze by expanding voice command support and making it easier to watch free live TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRGcd6"&gt;With the Roku OS 10.5 update, Roku users will be able to access the live TV guide — which now boasts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628020/roku-live-tv-guide-17-new-channels"&gt;more than 200 channels&lt;/a&gt; to stream for free — faster by pinning it to their home screens alongside their other apps and channels. After updating, users just need to search for “Live TV on The Roku Channel” and will be able to install it as they would any other app or streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o57DUV"&gt;Additionally, for those who navigate the Roku experience using voice commands, Roku says its voice command support extends to “nearly any channel” in search. That includes Spotify and Netflix as well, two previously notable exceptions that are now supported. Plus, a new music and podcast row in search should make navigation a little easier as well. With the update, Roku is partnering with Spotify for the launch of the new search integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f99jzA"&gt;And lastly, Roku users may have noticed its mobile app recently got a bit of a facelift. In mid-August, the company began rolling out new save list and home tab features. Users will find the latter to the left of the Roku Channel tab on the bottom panel. The save list, meanwhile, can be found from both the home and remote tabs on mobile, and Roku users can bookmark anything they might be interested in watching in the future by clicking on the title and selecting “add to save list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8EgZM"&gt;Roku OS 10.5 will begin arriving on Roku devices in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia releases Windows 11 driver with DLSS support for more than 100 games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EdwjFXtW-SrwAdowNWSR94xsQPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882218/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X8oQ0L"&gt;Nvidia is releasing a new display driver today that adds DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) support to 28 games, and is now certified for both Windows 10 and Windows 11. The 28 additional DLSS games brings the total of games to more than 100, an important milestone for Nvidia’s AI-based temporal upscaling. DLSS upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efjuJU"&gt;Most of the new DLSS additions come courtesy of the Unreal Engine 4 DLSS plugin that’s making it easier for developers to integrate DLSS into their games. &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remast&lt;/em&gt;ered will ship with DLSS support next month, and Nvidia is promising an up to 2X performance boost at 4K. Every GeForce RTX GPU can get over 60fps at max settings in 4K with DLSS enabled, and it means cards like the RTX 2080 Ti jump from an average of 70fps to 120fps, according to Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwEQXOS72lTs2ODotmI-yTrKMeM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863695/NVIDIA_September_2021_GeForce_RTX_DLSS_Update_Alan_Wake_remastered_3840x2160_performance.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alan Wake gets some big performance boosts with DLSS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gRcAgX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Industria, &lt;/em&gt;releasing on September 30th, will also include DLSS support, alongside support for a new Nvidia DLAA (Deep Learning Anti-Aliasing) AI-based anti-aliasing mode on &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls Online &lt;/em&gt;test servers. DLAA is designed “for users who have spare GPU headroom and want higher levels of image quality,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fwindows-11-game-ready-driver%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22683585%2Fnvidia-windows-11-driver-dlss-support-games-features-alan-wake" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Nvidia&lt;/a&gt;. It works similarly to DLSS, but instead of boosting performance it boosts image quality instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ujmPq3"&gt;Today’s Nvidia driver also includes Windows 11 support, with optimizations for &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered, Deathloop, Diablo II: Resurrected, Far Cry 6, Hot Wheels Unleashed, Industria, New World, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; World War Z: Aftermath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul0XOP"&gt;You can download Nvidia’s latest driver (472.12) for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fdrivers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F20%2F22683585%2Fnvidia-windows-11-driver-dlss-support-games-features-alan-wake" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over at Nvidia’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayaze5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 20th 9:20AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with new details on Nvidia’s DLAA technology.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hisense’s new promo will let you test drive some of its best TVs for 100 days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0suhjr0Ma3sAysSiU1K_mScsYN8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882267/Hisense_No_Regrets_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EsaY4o"&gt;Buying a TV can be a big decision, but Hisense’s latest promotion wants to help; starting today the company is offering what it calls its “100 Day Guarantee,” which will let you buy a Hisense TV, try it out for 100 days in the comfort of your own living room, and then, if you don’t like it, you can send it back for a full refund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uO0Pxv"&gt;A number of Hisense’s latest models are included in the offer, including the U6G, U7G, and U8G. But more surprisingly, even the 75-inch, U800GR 8K (which costs $2,699.99) and the company’s high-end 100-inch and 120-inch L9G laser TV projection setups (which cost $5,500 and $6,000, respectively) are eligible — meaning that if you’re willing to lay out the cost, you can test drive the fanciest TVs that Hisense sells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="levfbd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are, of course, some caveats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFKDp2"&gt;There are, of course, some caveats. You’ll have to purchase the TV from Hisense’s approved list (which includes Amazon, Best Buy, PC Richard, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=http%3A%2F%2FWalmart.com&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart.com&lt;/a&gt;) between September 9th through October 31st. You’ll have to pay the full price of the TV upfront, with the refund coming once Hisense has received the TV back. You’ll also have to register your TV on &lt;a href="https://hisense-promos.com"&gt;Hisense’s promotional website&lt;/a&gt; as part of the program within 14 days of getting it, or else you won’t be able to return it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0ivdT"&gt;Once you’ve done all that, if you want to go through with returning the TV (which Hisense presumably is hoping you won’t), you’ll have to go back to that same promotional website and submit a return request. As part of that request, you’ll have to send in your receipt for the TV, along with pictures that prove that you haven’t wrecked it during your 100-day trial period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fsXWs"&gt;Hisense’s terms and conditions states, “Undamaged and not permanently marked (subject to reasonable wear and tear to be expected from one-hundred (100) days use of the Qualifying Product for its intended purpose and where such wear and tear does not materially affect the resale value).” You’ll also need to send it back in the original packaging with its accessories, so don’t throw away that box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7a7YD"&gt;After you’ve done all that, Hisense will confirm your claim and send over a prepaid shipping label, at which point you’ll have 21 days to send it back. Once it gets the TV back, it’ll issue a refund through either prepaid Visa debit cards or a PayPal transfer. As for the returned TVs, Hisense promises that they’ll all be “either recycled or refurbished.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VTLwc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku’s new $50 Streaming Stick 4K replaces one of the company’s best players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjyhF_a5r5nlqaQIYei6CoMnWWw=/0x50:1500x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882217/Roku_Streaming_Stick_4K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9KASiv"&gt;Roku today announced the Streaming Stick 4K, the company’s latest streaming device. Priced at $49.99, the new product replaces the popular Streaming Stick Plus, which has long been a go-to recommendation as one of the best streamers for under $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LR9QXI"&gt;The new hardware improves on the old with features like Dolby Vision HDR and speedier performance. It now boots up 30 percent quicker and has a long-range Wi-Fi receiver that delivers speeds that are up to twice as fast. Roku says the device can intelligently optimize bandwidth and streaming performance based on your network conditions. Like its predecessor, the Streaming Stick 4K supports Apple’s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit and can also be tied into Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant smart homes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmR5qNSwDxlJkOSFqg6CF7cPygU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863770/Roku_Streaming_Stick_4K_behind_TV.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Streaming Stick 4K has a similar design to the Streaming Stick Plus that it’s replacing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NvIjyf"&gt;As usual, the Streaming Stick 4K plugs directly into a TV’s HDMI port and can be neatly hidden from view. Roku includes a voice remote (with TV controls), which has support for push-to-talk voice commands. If you prefer hands-free controls for finding something to watch, you can step up to the $69.99 Streaming Stick 4K Plus. This time, the “Plus” means you’re also getting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22391174/roku-voice-remote-pro-review-features-price"&gt;Roku Voice Remote Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which has a rechargeable battery and mid-field microphones that allow the remote to pick up your voice searches or commands even when it’s sitting on a table. Those voice controls include the ability to easily locate the Voice Remote Pro should it get lost in the couch cushions or go MIA elsewhere in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IR46aj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roku’s latest update is making free live TV even easier to stream ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22680133/roku-os-10-5-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8KPUj8"&gt;Separately, Roku also announced today that it’s adding the ability to create a 5.1 surround system using a Streambar or Streambar Pro, two pairs of its Roku Wireless Speakers, and a Wireless Subwoofer. (Previously, you were limited to just the soundbar, sub, and rear surrounds.) In this setup, the soundbar acts as a dedicated center channel and lets the front left and right speakers provide more immersion. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KMx7ZJOdQVYgsZA5s4_SEFQKeDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863766/TCL_Roku_TV_Wireless_Soundbar_Lifestyle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roku / TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL is releasing a soundbar designed for Roku TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HYYd57"&gt;And on the subject of soundbars, TCL will be releasing a Roku TV Wireless Soundbar for $179.99 in October. As the name suggests, it’s designed to be paired with a television that runs Roku’s software. If that’s the case, you get integrated soundbar controls in the TV menus, automatic audio/video sync, and more flexible placement since you don’t need to worry about running a cable from the soundbar to your TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laSdcq"&gt;Roku says the Streaming Stick 4K is due to arrive at US and UK retailers in mid-October and will come to Canada as well as Mexico and other Latin America countries in the coming months. The Streaming Stick 4K Plus will also be available from Roku.com and all major retailers in the US in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Nq8SG"&gt;Aside from these hardware announcements, Roku also shared some new features that are coming to its Roku OS with the update to version 10.5. My colleague Catie Keck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22444174"&gt;has covered those here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 deals are extra aggressive this year, here’s why</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X3_zMQMnkK42DgY00r3QevGnIqA=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69882128/lcimg_78e65da1_4e90_4b7e_a300_6bce2342e8ea.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px24Oy"&gt;“You get free iPhone upgrades for life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzwceT"&gt;“You get a $500 gift card for switching carriers!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buZXND"&gt;I can almost hear Oprah shouting the many competing offers from all the carriers — AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon — as soon as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple “California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was over. They’re all offering huge incentives to entice you to trade-in an old device, switch carriers, then sign up for a top-shelf cellular plan. If you’re in the market for a new carrier and iPhone right now, you can probably land yourself a “free” iPhone 13 (or only pay a nominal fee for the flagship iPhone 13 Pro Max), even if you’re preordering before the phones hit stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjtSF"&gt;Many of these offers seem too good to be true and are a bit surprising to see on new iPhones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407894/apple-q2-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;historically have sold themselves&lt;/a&gt;. Who can ignore Verizon for giving you a $500 prepaid MasterCard gift card, just for ditching your carrier? How about the sky-high trade-in offers that all the carriers are advertising, like the too-good-to-be-true offer of giving you $350 for a used Samsung A50, which retails about $180? Across the board, the carriers are particularly aggressive with their signup offers this year, as detailed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"&gt;in our preorder guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D05T4he8paoSK__to_e-rJJhEN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22858831/lcimg_17b9e15c_0998_429c_bb51_493611b203d6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s pricing for the new iPhone 13 models isn’t out of the ordinary — but few people will actually pay that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n0jSDK"&gt;Whether you choose T-Mobile, Verizon, or AT&amp;amp;T, all the offers fit the same basic premise. In exchange for a discount on the newest iPhone 13 device, after you trade-in an older device for whatever value, you’ll be paying for the balance of your device in monthly installments. You also must qualify and sign up for a typically more expensive unlimited plan that ties you to your phone and carrier for at least 24-months — or 36-months if you go with AT&amp;amp;T. The new plan will also likely control when and what device you can upgrade to next, which helps carriers and phone manufacturers better forecast the demand for devices and gives you that “free” upgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pMgu7z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nulRvV"&gt;For those iPhone 13 shoppers who are already happy with their carriers or existing data plans, or just want the latest unlocked device on a pre-paid plan, the carriers won’t extend as generous offers to you. If you’re already an existing customer, at minimum, you have to be willing to upgrade to the premium plans like at Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T or take a lesser deal at T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qopFGV"&gt;It is clear that carriers want to take back control over your upgrade cycle by offering scheduled upgrades and want to lock you into a bigger plan than you need by dangling an almost free phone. Sound familiar?   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq5k6z"&gt;“The offers are more generous, but the big picture is that we’re seeing a shift from the EIP [Equipment Installment Plan] model to the subsidy model,” according to Wave7 Research’s principal analyst Jeffrey Moore. “To some extent, we’re back to the subsidy model that existed a decade ago, when people routinely got an iPhone for $200, but paid higher monthly rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr8mjv"&gt;It also may seem like Apple is the one that is driving much of these promotions, as more iPhones sold is always beneficial for the company. But as much as Apple needs people to buy new iPhones every year, carriers need the sales even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkgz5V"&gt;According to Wave7 Research’s monthly surveys of retail wireless stores in the US, “more than 60% of smartphone activations at national carrier stores are of iPhones, with remaining activations being of Android devices, with Samsung having dominant Android share.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svV2PO"&gt;Carriers also have an extra incentive to nudge customers toward iPhones this year: the on-going global chip shortage has really affected the supply of Android phones, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676054/t-mobile-cfo-peter-osvaldik-samsung-supply-no-note"&gt;Samsung phones in particular&lt;/a&gt;. In Wave7 Research’s August 2021 survey of retail stores, it found the “supply of the base Galaxy 21 has been particularly weak for Verizon in the U.S., with multiple Samsung models out of stock online.” With a new round of iPhone 13s flooding retail stores, it’s not hard to see why carriers have an incentive to sell iPhones rather than Androids right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="y57ghv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chip shortages have made other phone models difficult to stock&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mxLTYe"&gt;It doesn’t hurt that service providers also need to shore up their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21511946/5g-iphone-12-upgrade-speed-network-mmwave-hype"&gt;5G user base&lt;/a&gt;, as they continue to expand the (fractured) 5G network in America. If iPhones are the lures that can hook customers to upgrade to an all-inclusive, multi-year data plan, then the carriers are in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTO7Sm"&gt;The truth is, Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629003/us-phone-upgrades-apple-samsung-market"&gt;holding onto their phones longer&lt;/a&gt; than they used to (remember the annual upgrade days?), with each generation of phone being more iterative than innovative. While that’s great news for our wallets and the environment, this trend does carriers no favors — they don’t exactly make the most money when we buy unlocked phones and order pre-paid plans or hang on to our phones for three years or more. Now that new iPhones are on the market, this is the time for carriers to once again capture some new customers with shiny iPhone 13s and fancy plans with built-in upgrade cycles — hook, line, and sinker. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says no 9T this year, 2022 flagship will run merged Oppo OS</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KQLNEl"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau has confirmed that the company doesn’t plan to release its traditional T-series device in the second half of this year. He also announced that next year’s OnePlus flagship phone would run on a newly unified operating system, following the company’s integration with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;fellow BBK Electronics subsidiary Oppo&lt;/a&gt;. OnePlus announced it would be merging the codebases of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;Android-based OxygenOS operating system with Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt; in July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piK8i5"&gt;This means we’re unlikely to see a OnePlus 9T following up this year’s OnePlus 9. Despite the similar names, the company’s T-series phones have offered significant upgrades over its flagships from earlier in the year. For example, the 8T had around double the charging speeds of the 8, while the 7T bumped the original 7 display to a higher 90Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCVMSE"&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product,” Lau said via a translator in a roundtable interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and other journalists. This will be the first year without a T-series device since OnePlus adopted the release schedule with the OnePlus 3T in 2016. Since then, like clockwork, OnePlus has released a new T-series phone in the latter half of each year, culminating in last year’s OnePlus 8T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qclhlz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This year we will not be launching a T-series product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AL8dUt"&gt;In what is effectively a merger between OnePlus and Oppo, the two companies will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;unifying the underlying codebases of OxygenOS and Oppo’s ColorOS&lt;/a&gt;. The two Android-based operating systems will continue to have their own branding and unique features, Lau said, but the code underpinning them will be the same, and they’ll be developed by a unified team. The way OnePlus describes it, the approach will result in an operating system that’s “fast and smooth” and “clean and lightweight” like OxygenOS, while also being “reliable” and “smart and feature-rich” like ColorOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa1Iiz"&gt;Lau said the codebase integration of the two operating systems was completed in June, and that it’s already helping to allow for more frequent software updates. But we’ll have to wait until next year to see the first OnePlus flagship launch with the newly integrated operating system. It won’t just be new OnePlus phones getting the new OS — it will also come to OnePlus’s older devices is they’re still scheduled to receive support. These support periods include three major updates for flagship phones, two for most Nord devices, and one for Nord N phones. Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22443128"&gt;Oppo announced&lt;/a&gt; that the OnePlus 9 series will receive a beta of the new software in October, followed by the OnePlus 8 series in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUUm1X"&gt;OnePlus tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that integrating its operations with Oppo was necessary to make it more efficient, and would streamline its R&amp;amp;D resources “to support more products and work more efficiently.” As well as integrating the two company’s operating systems, OnePlus also said it would be integrating its Warp Charge fast charging standard with Oppo’s SuperVOOC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Twy7Da"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/chinese-smartphone-giant-cuts-jobs-after-going-up-against-apple?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Oppo’s merger with OnePlus is creating redundancies, including within its ColorOS development unit, as the two BBK subsidiaries pool resources. As many as 20 percent of staff across some software and device teams are reportedly being cut, according to the report. The cuts are reportedly the result of Oppo expanding too rapidly in recent years, moving aggressively into new countries and product categories with big bets that haven’t payed off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmOB7c"&gt;During our briefing, however, which took place prior to the publication of &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report, OnePlus’s Lau played down the possibility of merger-related layoffs. “[Redundancies haven’t] been something that’s come up during the merger,” Lau said via a translator, “We have a focus on bringing together the OnePlus and Oppo teams to be able to bring together the strengths of both sides into the merged entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
