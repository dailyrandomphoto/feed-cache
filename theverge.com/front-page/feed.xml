    <title>Apparent ransomware attack closes Baltimore County public schools</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GmBozO7YlZKeZhPmpbGc_Xn4vW8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980779/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="StfBhI"&gt;The Baltimore County Public School (BCPS) system has canceled classes after an apparent ransomware attack shut down internal networks. Described by officials as “a networking issue,” the outage is affecting the schools’ email and grading systems, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfGcK2"&gt;BCPS chief of staff Mychael Dickerson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DMDForward/status/1331601353085513728"&gt;confirmed on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the outage is believed to be the result of a ransomware attack. “We were the victim of a ransomware cyber attack,” he said. “Our BCPS technology team is working to address the situation.” Dickerson could only tweet the message since &lt;a href="https://www.bcps.org/"&gt;the BCPS website&lt;/a&gt; is currently down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxLeav"&gt;As a result of the outage, offices have been closed for the day and students have been given the day off. “We knew it wouldn’t be a quick fix,” Dickerson &lt;a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-county/cng-co-baltimore-county-schools-closed-network-issue-20201125-drhmnq5ilraplea2h4v7p4pn34-story.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We just don’t want people standing by thinking we’ll get back up.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDy8hL"&gt;Ransomware attacks have become a common tactic for cybercriminals, often targeting underfunded infrastructure like hospitals, schools, and municipal governments. A separate ransomware attack paralyzed Baltimore’s City government in May of last year, shutting down online systems for paying water bills and other services. Major companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285758/honda-ransomware-virus-attack-production-halt-offices-workers"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353842/garmin-ransomware-attack-wearables-wastedlocker-evil-corp"&gt;Garmin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21356757/canon-ransomware-attack-usa"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt; have also been compromised by ransomware. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443851/death-ransomware-attack-hospital-germany-cybersecurity"&gt;a ransomware attack on the Düsseldorf University Hospital&lt;/a&gt; was linked to the death of a female patient, the first death directly tied to a ransomware attack on medical facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyUhdh"&gt;Ransomware attacks work by encrypting data on compromised networks and locking out the network operators. Criminals then ask for a ransom payment (typically in bitcoin) to restore functionality. Because the ransom is often lower than the cost of recovery, many victims simply pay the requested amount, making it an unfortunately profitable scheme. In February, &lt;a href="https://blog.emsisoft.com/en/35583/report-the-cost-of-ransomware-in-2020-a-country-by-country-analysis/"&gt;a report by ID Ransomware&lt;/a&gt; estimated that US businesses paid more than $1.3 billion to resolve ransomware attacks in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These are the best Black Friday TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HbIYJbhaYuwZtj3CCImAKsl0nYc=/0x51:1560x1091/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980741/Screen_Shot_2020_11_25_at_8.43.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="30Yud8"&gt;With a pair of next-gen video game consoles now on the market, it’s a very good time to be shopping for a new 4K TV that can best showcase their capabilities. Even if gaming isn’t your thing, Black Friday season always brings about excellent discounts on sets from many of the top brands like Samsung, LG, Vizio, Sony, TCL, and others. Whether you’re ready to spend over $1,000 or are looking for something more on the budget side, odds are you can find something to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAtFEz"&gt;Looking for more than just a TV? Check out our updating list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;the best Black Friday deals you can get right now.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o5AZiQ"&gt;The best TV deals for Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 owners&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MHP8gq"&gt;The Xbox Series X and PS5 do much more than just play games in 4K. They support HDR, variable refresh rate (in the case of the X), and can output games at up to 120Hz. This makes games feel smoother and more responsive than ever before. Variable refresh can eliminate unsightly tearing and make any dips in frame rate unnoticeable, and this — along with 120Hz support — is also something you’ll find on the $300 Xbox Series S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMc5Vz"&gt;If you plan on getting one of the new consoles (or already have), finding a TV that can get the most from them could be tricky. Generally speaking, you’ll have to buy a very recent set, and you’ll want to ensure that it supports the newer HDMI 2.1 specification. But buying a TV released this year doesn’t have to mean breaking the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CE2cWf"&gt;I’ve picked out the below TVs as the best options you can get for one of the next-gen gaming consoles in 2020. All of them should take advantage of everything the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PlayStation 5 can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P5UnlZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WscT1J"&gt;48-inch: $1,449 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766030161641896" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrC9TJ"&gt;65-inch: $1,899.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766059250185154" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; | $1,999.99 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555067-REG%2Flg_oled65cxpua_cxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21591567%2Fblack-friday-tv-deals-sale-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Qr8ekn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="gOTJ4z"&gt;65-inch: $1,799 at &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?prodsku=6401923&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flg-65-class-bx-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv%2F6401923.p%3FskuId%3D6401923&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="dLiJkH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5dpvuL"&gt;65-inch: $1,499.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766254883271209" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O99z1H"&gt;Vizio’s Elevate Dolby Atmos soundbar, designed as a perfect companion for the OLED TV, is also &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766285896033058" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Best Buy for $700&lt;/a&gt; (normally $1,000). It has rotating speakers that point upward for Atmos content and then rotate forward for regular stereo audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubft3P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733779"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TVRNxj"&gt;55-inch: $1,049.99 (normally $1,299.99) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766412231937570" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/qled-4k-tvs/55-class-q80t-qled-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-tv-2020-qn55q80tafxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1546571-REG%2Fsamsung_qn55q80tafxza_55_qled_q80_series.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21591567%2Fblack-friday-tv-deals-sale-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ameOMr"&gt;Sony X900H&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lBWPVd"&gt;As the maker of the PS5, you’d hope Sony’s TVs would be a good match for the console. The X900H fits that bill, though some of the OLED picks are a better overall package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yMu7t8"&gt;75-inch: $1,599.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766475965495345" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545412-REG%2Fsony_xbr75x900h_x900h_75_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21591567%2Fblack-friday-tv-deals-sale-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nDyzKP"&gt;65-inch: $999.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766501964102820" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; | $1,098 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545417-REG%2Fsony_xbr65x900h_x900h_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21591567%2Fblack-friday-tv-deals-sale-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;aside id="8RIV0k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Black Friday deals happening at Best Buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583253/best-buy-black-friday-tech-deals-cyber-monday-tvs-games-phones"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h3 id="ZQHT45"&gt;TCL 6 Series Roku TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JKrtPJ"&gt;TCL’s latest 6 Series TV has tremendous picture quality for the price and supports those next-gen gaming features including 4K at 120Hz and variable refresh rate. Plus, you get built-in Roku software, so you can find pretty much any streaming app you need right on the TV itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IKTuZe"&gt;65-inch: $899.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766539321572183" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1584065-REG%2Ftcl_65r635_65_6_serie_4k_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21591567%2Fblack-friday-tv-deals-sale-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tK3s30"&gt;Great 4K TVs for watching movies and TV&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UcvLZF"&gt;If next-gen gaming isn’t in the cards for your new TV (or isn’t a priority), the options open up considerably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FqqizP"&gt;Sony A8H OLED 4K TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="SrTxoY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="TOjabm"&gt;55-inch: $1,499 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A8H-55-Inch-Compatibility/dp/B084KQFNBX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766755447061028" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HzHArL"&gt;Samsung 70-inch Class 6 Series 4K TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rC0gMz"&gt;This is one of those cases where if all you care about is a giant TV, it’s easy to score one for hundreds less than more premium models. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766794160975714" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;At just $529 from Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung’s 70-inch 6 Series TV gets you 4K resolution, HDR, and a slew of built-in streaming apps — all for under $600, let alone $1,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UzE5Za"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are the best Black Friday streaming deals for Hulu, Spotify, Sling TV, and more","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21603508/black-friday-streaming-deals-tv-movies-subscription-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="0eJZl6"&gt;Good 4K TVs on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DZtTdb"&gt;Not everyone cares about having the absolute best, top-tier picture quality. Thankfully, TVs have gotten to the point where spending $500 or less can still get you a set with a very enjoyable 4K image. Some models still manage to include expanded HDR color in this price category, even if the difference won’t be as apparent as with more premium TVs that can get much brighter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5DqUiO"&gt;TCL 4 Series 55-inch 4K TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ISFq9p"&gt;$279.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724767143876093364" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CNhPQF"&gt;Vizio 50-inch MQ6 series 4K HDR TV&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X2F2LJ"&gt;$298 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FVIZIO-50-Class-4K-UHD-LED-Quantum-Smart-TV-HDR-M6x-Series-M506x-H9%2F910109519&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with xQc</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="xQC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UsjOgWlBep5l4YRMW8x_RPP2Nq4=/0x0:1422x948/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980671/xqc.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DFNo4F"&gt;Last week, the streamer Félix “xQcOW” Lengyel was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573715/twitch-ban-xqc-felix-lengyel-cheating-twitch-rivals"&gt;temporarily banned from Twitch for cheating at a GlitchCon Twitch Rivals event&lt;/a&gt;. It was the third time this year he’s been suspended from Twitch, and his teammates Rabia “Nightblue3” Yazbek and Lucas “Mendo” Håkansson were banned alongside him. I got in touch with Lengyel to chat about what happened, and what he’s learned from the experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J58IHl"&gt;According to him, the stream sniping incident — when he and his teammates queued into a competitor’s lobby with the intent to derail their game — was a bit of banter that went too far, though Lengyel is careful to note that he’s not trying to justify what happened. “The atmosphere was really like funny, banter-y — we went to their Discord, they went to our Discord, you know, we’re talking shit, whatever,” he says. “And now that I’ve computed it, it’s like, holy, this is just... this is like so stupid.” After the event, Lengyel says he messaged the people involved to apologize. Even so, he says he didn’t think anything would happen on Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pfVkjs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If I can be an example of wrongdoing, I can be an example of redemption.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PEb0wJ"&gt;Lengyel’s Twitch partner manager broke the news of his ban. He’s not mad, though; competitive rulings are competitive rulings, and through his career as an esports competitor he understands why these decisions are made. “I don’t want to do wrong stuff. I want to always be better. It’s why I’m rarely upset at competitive rulings and bans and whatnot,” he says. “And I think it’s sort of healthy, for people that have my platform to know for sure that I got punished for something, they know why it happened.” Lengyel’s interested, he says, in modeling growth. That said, he’s not without &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XQc#Controversies"&gt;controversy&lt;/a&gt;. Lengyel’s been temporarily banned from Twitch on multiple occasions for streaming explicit content, and he was previously suspended from esports teams for using disparaging language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqUpr2"&gt;“If I can be an example of wrongdoing, I can be an example of redemption,” he says. “And I think that matters, maybe even more.” He also says you shouldn’t stream snipe in games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1b0DB"&gt;Lengyel says he wants his audience to know that he’s trying to be better — to move forward. “Even though sometimes we take like, 10 steps back, as long as we create a pattern of gaining steps forward again, and getting through it again, I think that matters a lot.” (The overarching message, though, he says, is: “don’t fuck with competitive integrity.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6x4PUT"&gt;To that end, Lengyel is starting something he’s calling a streamer showcase: a show of some kind that features smaller Twitch creators. It’s an idea that grew out of his &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; games with smaller streamers earlier this summer, where he started a Discord server and invited people who replied to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xqc/status/1302924666387005442?lang=en"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s been really crazy to see all these smaller streamers grow, like, out of the blue — and all of them getting partnered and getting sponsorships.” It’s an example, he says, of using his platform for good. He’s a little light on details. Personally, though, I think it’s interesting because to me it seems like he’s starting to grapple with the dynamics of online influence — with what it means to be famous on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PohCs6"&gt;And Lengyel’s organizational partners are behind him as well. He’s part of Luminosity Gaming, a professional esports outfit. “Being partners is more than just celebrating the good times. Felix knows he made a mistake and we’re encouraged to see how seriously he is taking his return,” wrote Corey Mandell, executive vice president of Enthusiast Gaming, Luminosity Gaming’s parent company, in an emailed statement. “We remain committed to supporting his personal journey and help realize his ambitious plans.” Lengyel is set to return to Twitch on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Odyssey G9 does the work of three monitors</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;And I am now thoroughly spoiled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uiAqji"&gt;I have been a technology cheapskate most of my life. I’ve rarely bought a monitor brand-new; I’m pleased to say I pieced together &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1315735960139644929"&gt;my current&lt;/a&gt; three-screen articulating swing-arm setup primarily from Craigslist and hand-me-downs. But this fall, I had an opportunity to temporarily replace my three aging displays with the most ridiculous, most advanced gaming monitor ever made: the super-ultrawide, super-curved, ultra-high resolution 49-inch Samsung Odyssey G9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaU80a"&gt;The Samsung Odyssey G9 is a monitor so big, so wide, so curved, it can fill a midsized desk and wrap around your entire field of view. It’s also simply a phenomenal screen: speedy (240Hz, 1ms, G-Sync, and FreeSync 2), high resolution (5120 x 1440-pixel), and bursting with brilliant color thanks to a QLED panel that tops out at an eye-searing 1,000 nits of brightness. I’m not kidding when I say I have to avert my eyes when I launch &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; in HDR, and I could swear I felt the flames the first few times my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496153/star-wars-squadrons-review-single-player-campaign-x-wing-tie-fighter-space-simulator-vr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’ TIE Bomber blasted an X-Wing into oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3NT24N"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...to this. &lt;a href="https://t.co/eehPZbxAYz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eehPZbxAYz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1330787569160785921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aA6YCj"&gt;As they say &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;I have ascended —&lt;/em&gt; and the past few weeks have been a gaming and productivity experience like few I’ve had before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1vnGj"&gt;But gradually, I’ve been coming back down to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VxIYwS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9719395"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jBZx"&gt;Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6KV2CD"&gt;The Odyssey G9 is a showstopper, and I don’t just mean that figuratively: last January, attendees of the world’s biggest technology show were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055745/samsung-odyssey-g9-super-ultra-wide-gaming-monitor-ces-2020"&gt;dazzled by its unprecedented curvature and sci-fi inspired frame&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3MuAv"&gt;When I put that same monitor on my humble IKEA sit-stand desk, the effect is otherworldly. Compared to my old hodgepodge of screens and rat’s nest of cabling, this G9 looks like a terminal aboard a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; spaceship... even if my physical keyboard and its long braided cable ruin the illusion a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IBfBL"&gt;The sheer size of the Odyssey G9 and its broad-shouldered stand do limit your options. I’m lucky that my small-form-factor Ncase M1 can fit behind the screen, and there’s just enough clearance (a little over six inches) for my Audioengine A2+ speakers to fit underneath the monitor at the stand’s highest position. But if I had a bigger PC or bigger speakers, I might have also needed a bigger desk — or else had to use the included 100mm x 100mm VESA adapter to mount the nearly four-feet wide, one-foot deep, 31-pound screen to the wall. My current monitor arms can’t carry nearly that much weight, though you can buy some TV arms that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJnN9zHYkfl-KQc900rOKYC4OfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026740/shollister_201031_42850027.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I haven’t done a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/work-from-home-remote-wfh" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s on your desk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; yet, but now you know.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTZhtO"&gt;As it is, I’m a fan of the way this monitor brings my whole desk together. Two DisplayPorts and an HDMI 2.0 port let me switch between three video sources easily, including a side-by-side mode which lets me display two at once, effectively giving my PC and game console (or a second computer) each their own 24.5-inch, 2560 x 1440 displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UX55jg"&gt;There’s also a two-port USB-A 3.0 hub and a 3.5mm audio output, which worked perfectly with my keyboard’s USB and 3.5mm audio passthrough. As you can see from my photos, I can do a lot with only a single visible cable thanks to those ports. And while the narrow V-shaped stand might seem a little minimal for a monitor this hefty, it takes a decent shove to get it to tip forward even at its highest position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y1tkBzFGw-zW7vVTvIdSR7Em7Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067624/20201012_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Underneath the rear cover, cable management at work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tF-7mIuLYWR0Y_FMDFytlQyVXq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026736/shollister_201031_42850043.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The five-way nub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DwoAO52QH_uOGChttOgVh5BjaUM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026734/shollister_201031_42850044.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cable management and OSD options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HAKujH"&gt;You can adjust the monitor’s settings using a tiny five-way control nub underneath the power LED, and it’s remarkable how much you can tweak — including the ability to crop the entire panel to 4:3, 16:9, or 21:9 aspect ratios instead of stretching out the image. You can effectively have a 27-inch HDR panel for your game console or TV whenever you need. It’s just a shame that the monitor’s biggest benefits don’t necessarily translate to its side-by-side mode, where your 240Hz HDR screen &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ultrawidemasterrace/comments/huhuvu/samsung_odyssey_g9_why_on_pbp_the_refresh_rate_is/"&gt;generally&lt;/a&gt; becomes a pair of 60Hz SDR ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YmYPjH"&gt;Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3xsg0V"&gt;My first big test for Samsung’s Odyssey G9 wasn’t a console or even PC gaming — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21504585/apple-iphone-12-event-live-blog-news-announcements"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, I co-hosted &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s industry-famous Apple event live blog, capturing every screenshot you saw. I normally run three monitors because I switch tasks like mad, and if there’s a better multitasking test than an Apple event, I haven’t met it yet.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9AMfVkEquDEmR_5o8Fy7lmm54U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026735/shollister_201031_42850042.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of room for productivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mhGmxn"&gt;At first, I wasn’t sure this epic screen would work. Most apps and websites aren’t designed to display across the vast expanse of a single 32:9 monitor, so you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to live in windows. I couldn’t simply toss one or two apps onto each monitor like I usually do. But while Samsung doesn’t ship the G9 with any good windowing software and Windows 10’s default Snap is woefully insufficient, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20852451/microsoft-windows-10-powertoys-download-features"&gt;Microsoft’s free downloadable FancyZones windowing manager&lt;/a&gt; worked wonders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbflgm"&gt;l built my own set of dedicated snappable spots for the Apple live stream; &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s live-blogging tool; Slack; a browser window to keep track of any Apple press releases that might pop during the show; and even a narrow strip of Windows Explorer so I could see which images I’d already captured and weed them out as necessary. The only other wrinkle was the additional Chrome extension I had to download to ensure YouTube could launch “full screen” in a browser window, instead of taking over my entire ultrawide monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2cWU2"&gt;In general, while I did occasionally miss my two vertically oriented monitors for scrolling long webpages, Google Docs, and Tweetdeck, I found the G9’s gigantic horizontal expanse of real estate nearly as effective for most tasks. Where I could only squeeze four narrow columns of Tweetdeck onto my old portrait-orientation screens, the G9 would comfortably fit five, plus a 30-tab web browser, a nice vertical strip of Evernote for note-taking, and our Slack newsroom alongside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JKcsjjxhieSaJXND5rtAlcw6pYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22026742/shollister_201031_42850021.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The curve is even more noticeable from this angle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdyQrs"&gt;I wouldn’t say it’s &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than having three screens for work, but it seems like a sufficient substitute — except maybe that toast notifications now pop up in the corner of my eye where they’re pretty easy to miss. Still, it’s nice not to have to match color, contrast, and brightness across three screens at a time, or adjust how my mouse crosses from one monitor to the next. Having a single, vast, unbroken expanse of real estate that’s always the same distance from my face (as I spin in my chair) is an absolute treat. And while the Odyssey G9’s unprecedented curve does tend to catch ambient light, the matte screen does a great job of diffusing any glare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfjJoG"&gt;The ultrawide aspect ratio didn’t work as well for video as I hoped, though. While you might imagine 32:9 being great for movies, I had a hard time finding anything I could play in ultra high definition that wasn’t 16:9. Most streaming platforms won’t easily let you access their 4K and HDR content on a Windows machine to begin with — YouTube’s the primary exception, though Netflix works if you’ve got a recent Intel processor and use Microsoft Edge or the native app — and you’ll want 4K to take advantage of a screen this high-res and this close to your face. The 4K YouTube videos I played were definitely clearer than 1080p — I could really &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OCnzH7IiHo0?t=194"&gt;peep these pixels&lt;/a&gt; in Dieter’s iPhone 12 video review. And while standard 16:9, 1080p content does display just fine full-screen with black borders on the sides, it feels like I’m wasting a lot of screen real estate that way. Plus, the blacks are a bit gray, not the deep inky black you’d get from an OLED screen — particularly with HDR on and Samsung’s iffy local dimming enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gn2AXA"&gt;Gaming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FUkeQG"&gt;The first thing you should know about gaming on the Odyssey G9 is that you’ll want a serious graphics card to go with it. Technically, 5120 x 1440 resolution isn’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; as many pixels as a 3840 x 2160 4K UHD screen... but remember we’re also talking about a monitor that goes up to 240Hz. To properly review the Odyssey G9, I borrowed an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 to get enough horsepower, since my GTX 1080 couldn’t even run games like &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; at 60fps smoothly at that resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVoGsi"&gt;The second thing you should know about gaming on the Odyssey G9 is that it may not be quite as immersive as you’re imagining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Lj9FY"&gt;Don’t get me wrong: having an X-Wing cockpit wrapped all around you is an epic experience, and it feels like a true advantage to be able to use my peripheral vision in competitive shooters like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CS:GO. &lt;/em&gt;But it wasn’t long until I noticed something weird going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPGruSowwurA01jalQLEeuj4bV8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067625/32_9_star_wars_squadrons_hangar.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That TIE Interceptor on the left is looking a little flat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ErXjZDycJs1Dp_X9Vlvmf2V5Og=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067628/Screenshot__25_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, the soldier on the left is not normally that short.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yqj5yp"&gt;Look carefully at these images: notice how the sides are warped? Imperial deck officers and Novigrad Temple Guards aren’t generally this pudgy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ixdSFL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Warping is the norm at 32:9&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iWqITF"&gt;I tried game after game after game on the Odyssey G9, digging into my Steam, Epic, and Uplay libraries and tweaking a variety of settings, and this is simply the reality: every 3D game gets warped when you’re viewing it in a 32:9 aspect ratio, and there’s not much you can do about it. Changing your field of view in a game doesn’t get rid of the effect; it simply changes how much of the game world appears in the center of your screen (where things look normal) and at the edges (where they look stretched and zoomed). I actually pulled out a tape measure and checked: video game content that measures 4.75 inches at the center of the display can get stretched to a full 12 inches at the edges.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FovtAF"&gt;Now, this isn’t Samsung’s fault; &lt;a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1"&gt;it’s just the way games are built&lt;/a&gt;. Most games have a single virtual camera that exists at a single point in space, and while Nvidia once proposed changing that (see link above), the company’s Simultaneous Multi-Projection doesn’t seem to have made it into any of the games I tested. And in games with pre-rendered cutscenes, like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV, &lt;/em&gt;you’ll be watching them at their original aspect ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yNUy9"&gt;But before you write off 32:9 ultrawides right now, there are three things I’d like you to consider:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="d5VJMe"&gt;You might get used to it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="M0lOSV"&gt;It’s not that distracting in some games!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zU1B9V"&gt;2D games aren’t affected at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="gK9TqI"&gt;Let me give you some examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSpg1H9zWO-1DxxTYz55iv2L3W8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067630/pubg_32_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;em&gt; at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hboJ08z2F8N4QZTMDtpX1qNrmKY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067634/CS_go_32_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;CS:GO &lt;em&gt;at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7v1xQ9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; are incredibly competitive, nail-biting games where focus is everything, where you always need to have your gun at the ready and be scanning for any sign of movement. I don’t have time to turn my head left and right to appreciate the scenery or think about whether it’s warped. The G9 simply gives me enhanced peripheral vision, and it helps — not hurts — that things which appear in the corner of my eye are zoomed in by default. I got used to treating it as my peripheral vision and nothing else. (The 240Hz also comes in pretty handy in games like &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; where you can actually hit that frame rate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u7w2rpC32STAC3Ml2emfKMFO7Ys=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067633/GenshinImpact_RKEDElbqFg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;em&gt; cutscenes use the in-game engine and look great at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_AqNrHSsnhW294k-sVbKOfmcS1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067632/bioshock_infinite_32_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;BioShock Infinite &lt;em&gt;at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FsXhDq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Abzû&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BioShock Infinite&lt;/em&gt; are games with gorgeous, colorful worlds whose proportions aren’t “normal” to begin with, and I love having them wrapped around me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6Q52q_jY3Cms1hXxZ9SPhfDs10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067635/xcom_2_32_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;XCOM 2&lt;em&gt;’s more cinematic movements look pretty good in 32:9 as well.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m53nyM"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;XCOM 2&lt;/em&gt;, I found I could forgive the warping because of the enhanced field of view and the ability to easily zoom whenever you want. It’s nice to see more of the battlefield at once in &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; while planning out how my soldiers will move each turn, and it’s pretty cool to aim down the sights in &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt; without the typical claustrophobia that comes with zooming in, since you’re still able to see what’s going on around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5XIeHDfJj4YEtAkoUUzsHhURqNQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067637/Worms_W.M.D_6ZejzXw2gF.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Worms W.M.D &lt;em&gt;in 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5hn-VRhn6SHYLYAeuQXCRbsM694=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067638/disco_elysium_21_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;em&gt; supports 21:9, not 32:9, as you can see here.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vhW4TV"&gt;2D / 2.5D games like &lt;em&gt;Worms W.M.D&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; do look fantastic on the G9 — when you can find ones that actually support an ultrawide screen. That’s not a given: I managed to launch &lt;em&gt;Soldat&lt;/em&gt; at 5120 x 1440 resolution, but it didn’t stretch across my monitor. Games with fixed widths like &lt;em&gt;Streets of Rage 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hyper Light Drifter&lt;/em&gt; won’t either. Even &lt;em&gt;Disco Elysium&lt;/em&gt; only offers 21:9 support, not 32:9, unless you apply a hack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JaX9TxbDaxlNKGwjbURErYo6B5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067639/Borderlands3_DXlFm6diiE.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Borderlands 3 &lt;em&gt;looked pretty good at 32:9 when it wasn’t moving.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oWPjey"&gt;And for every one of the 3D games that worked, I also found a &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Witness&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Goat of Duty&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; where the warped geometry really bugged me, either because I wanted to sit back and look at the beautiful vista or because the edges of my screen were moving faster than the center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMGOXl"&gt;That’s not easy to show you in still images, so here’s a video clip to show you what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="gOOjis"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsmI_NVmEiE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L4AYIU"&gt;In games like the hack-and-slash &lt;em&gt;Mordhau&lt;/em&gt; or the road-tripping &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV&lt;/em&gt;, the distraction can also be when a piece of geometry that’s critical to the game constantly looks wrong. (Your &lt;em&gt;Mordhau&lt;/em&gt; sword or axe often extends into the warped area of the screen; the road itself in &lt;em&gt;FFXV&lt;/em&gt; looks curved instead of flat!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2aKBp"&gt;Frankly, the most annoying game I played on the Odyssey G9 was figuring out which games would work in the first place. Here, I have to shout out &lt;em&gt;Rock Paper Shotgun&lt;/em&gt;’s Katharine Castle, &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/18/the-35-best-ultrawide-pc-games/"&gt;whose brilliant example-filled guide&lt;/a&gt; showcases nearly three dozen titles that do work, complete with GIFs so you can see for yourself. But if you’re willing to work at it (and understand the risks), a community at the &lt;a href="https://www.wsgf.org/"&gt;Widescreen Gaming Forum&lt;/a&gt; (WSGF) and &lt;a href="https://community.pcgamingwiki.com/files/category/23-wsgf/"&gt;PCGamingWiki&lt;/a&gt; can help you hack and patch many existing titles to work at 32:9, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1TAUBlQZQGN7qoPX_LDtjge8Ho=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067641/death_stranding_32_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Death Stranding &lt;em&gt;tweaked to run at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orGcvN"&gt;For instance, I installed a trainer that let me run &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; at full-resolution 32:9, with an infinitely adjustable field of view, instead of the 21:9 that designer Hideo Kojima and company shipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRpSzk-EK5H62YQjWOzLY37Qwto=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067644/persona_4_golden.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Persona 4 Golden &lt;em&gt;at 32:9. I still need to un-stretch the UI.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LU41Yb"&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/widescreengamingforum/comments/h8izt5/persona_4_golden_pillarboxes_in_aspect_ratios/"&gt;a common tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, I hex-edited my &lt;em&gt;Persona 4 Golden&lt;/em&gt; .exe and remarkably wound up playing what was originally a 480p PlayStation 2 game — and later a 720p, 16:9 PlayStation Vita game — at a glorious 3840 x 1080 at 32:9. (I do still need to figure out how to un-stretch the UI.) And there’s an old, unmaintained program called &lt;a href="https://github.com/dlrudie/WidescreenFixer/releases/tag/Original"&gt;Widescreen Fixer&lt;/a&gt; that helped me revisit an old favorite:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wPuzBE1VoTckteztLecAGym1ihU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067643/MirrorsEdge_PQpIN3VMLk.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Mirror’s Edge &lt;em&gt;at 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yn9eXjvrXjDxYJ4gGMP3QYrWh2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22067642/MirrorsEdge_TgcxYDob1j.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;More&lt;/em&gt; Mirror’s Edge.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33Rugb"&gt;I wouldn’t say the community is robust enough that you could necessarily find a fix for any game in your library. But the WSGF &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gl%2FmJbzkf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21590961%2Fsamsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does now have a Discord&lt;/a&gt; you might want to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fAk76B"&gt;The ultimate ultrawide, but the best monitor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5kDNR1"&gt;The Samsung Odyssey G9 costs $1,479.99 — a premium price for a premium monitor like nothing else on the market. You can find other 49-inch 32:9 panels for less, but none with this combination of resolution, brightness, curvature, and refresh rate. The closest you can come is last year’s $1,200 Samsung CRG9 which maintains the resolution and brightness but with half the refresh rate at 120Hz and a notably less pronounced 1800R curvature — which, I imagine, wouldn’t be as good at giving you convincing peripheral vision in games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="tVH16M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9625148"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cMBgUY"&gt;If you’re looking for the ultimate ultrawide, this is currently it. I’m just not convinced that I am, personally, even if I had that much money earmarked for a new screen. For $1,500 and the enormous amount of space the Odyssey G9 consumes, I could buy a 48-inch LG OLED TV instead. I’d get a screen just as gigantic for my multitasking, but taller, with 120Hz G-Sync and FreeSync support, incredibly deep blacks, HDMI 2.1 for variable refresh rate for the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and no need to troubleshoot aspect ratios for my videos and games. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/x9n8Hz_RLqw"&gt;Linus Tech Tips has a video&lt;/a&gt; that dives deep into the pros and cons of that LG screen, and I came away fairly convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LaCuDM"&gt;It wouldn’t be the same experience that the G9 offers, of course, and I might regret it if Nvidia and AMD ever dust off Simultaneous Multi-Projection for real. The TV might also cut off access to a large portion of my desk, and I might not be able to place my PC and speakers within easy reach without blocking a bit of the screen. But I’d have a more obviously future-proof setup; an equally, if not more gorgeous image; and a lot less ambient annoyance when I want to game. At the very least, here’s hoping Samsung adds HDMI 2.1 to this epic monitor next year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on wireless earbuds</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro are discounted at several retailers this season.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhitJa"&gt;During &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; this year, you can expect to find many of the best wireless earbuds on sale for their lowest prices yet. Apple’s AirPods Pro, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus, and other popular models from Jabra, Sony, 1More, and more companies have never been more affordable. If you haven’t yet treated yourself to a set of truly wireless earbuds that connect via Bluetooth, prepare to never look back to using wired earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAI1eM"&gt;We have collected deals across multiple retailers below, and they’re all significantly lower than their usual asking price. As new deals become available or go out of stock, we’ll update this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oQibUb"&gt;Apple AirPod deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wgCXgH"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro, pictured above, are the star of Black Friday — and the best deal we’ve seen yet &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_ywp0i3SwExyOT35wUx0Mo38vUkExdm3-WQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3Dywp0i3SwExyOT35wUx0Mo38vUkExdm3-WQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will be launching online through Walmart&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, November 25th, at 7PM ET / 4PM PT. Their asking price is $250, though they’ve regularly sold for around $200. Walmart’s deal sees the price plummet to $169, though we expect it to sell out extremely fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zd8vKE"&gt;If you’d rather not deal with the hysteria or if you don’t want to shop from Walmart, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has the AirPods Pro selling at $190&lt;/a&gt;. This was nearly the best before word got around about the Walmart deal. But once that inevitably sells out, you should be able to find stock available at Woot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3CAOpg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVXoTR"&gt;For a simpler, less expensive set of AirPods that lack the Pro’s active noise cancellation and snug fit, the standard model is down to $119 (normally $159) at Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers. It includes a wired charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xJreM1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pTlrhv"&gt;If you want AirPods that include a case that charges wirelessly via a wireless charger, that model is $150 now (usually $199) at several retailers like Best Buy, Walmart, and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HRZzTq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf4Sih"&gt;Apple itself isn’t honoring the big discounts on AirPods this holiday, but it will give you a $25 gift card and the option for free engraving &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21611428%2Fblack-friday-earbuds-deals-wireless-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;if you buy some through its online store&lt;/a&gt; between November 27th and November 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2uJAIZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday deals on Apple devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21583192/apple-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pPjtU5"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jsElvD"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Bud deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A photo of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live in someone’s ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bY3-AtgWgYwPxOs3OMRpHfd8MDg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699402/cwelch_200804_4129_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are $140 at several retailers, but the best deal is at Best Buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lf48yH"&gt;At Best Buy, you can save on either the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; ($110, usually $150) or the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724676918321004525" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; ($140, usually $170). These prices aren’t anything &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;special at this point, but these get a nod &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724676948121680191" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for including a $20 Best Buy gift card with either set of earphones&lt;/a&gt;. The only catch is that you need to buy your earbuds in the Best Buy-exclusive blue colorway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wh14e2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8oyIZz"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lRsLhO"&gt;Jabra deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWXx9"&gt;Jabra is offering a great deal on its previous-generation Elite 65t wireless earbuds. Normally around $100 (though, they’re commonly available for less), you can pick up a set at Best Buy or Amazon for $70.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hd8ah5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625428"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sWSTjV"&gt;If you want features like noise cancellation, better sound quality, and a charging case that supports USB-C (unlike the Elite 65t’s Micro USB case), check out the Jabra Elite 75t, their successor. Normally $180, they’re down to $140.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmro1D"&gt;Best Buy says it will discount the Elite 75t further by $10 on Thursday, November 26th, so your final cost then will be $130 before tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KFWm4o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625438"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="YzBzXa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best Black Friday laptop deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21591398/black-friday-laptop-deals-sale-cyber-monday"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JDcp8N"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KugMUD"&gt;Other earbud deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="phoZtF"&gt;1More’s ColorBuds are down to $80 from $100 at the company’s site and Amazon for Black Friday. For the money, these offer some colorful style and crisp sound quality. They deliver up to six hour of listening per charge, with up to 22 hours provided by the charging case. To get the $80 price at Amazon, you’ll need to clip the coupon on the product page to knock $20 off the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bFcsGl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591243"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6ZcFW"&gt;The Sony WF-XB700 wireless earbuds usually cost $130, but they’re down to $68 at a few retailers, including Amazon, Best Buy, and more. These are a solid pick if you’re looking for a snug fit and better sound quality than you might expect for this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bzHUz4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591267"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iv45ou"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 normally cost $100, but they’re $70 right now at Amazon and Best Buy. In our roundup of the best budget-friendly wireless earbuds, my colleague Chris Welch said these have better microphones for voice calls than any other model he tested in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q15sZo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591175"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr9QWi"&gt;The OnePlus Buds wireless earbuds cost $59 through the OnePlus site and from Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. They usually cost $79. The OnePlus Buds Z usually get our recommendation since they are just $50, but for this deal, the standard Buds have larger drivers and a slightly more fashionable carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PAcLCz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9540296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r4nzHC"&gt;Amazon’s debut wireless earbuds, the Echo Buds, are back down to their lowest price at Amazon. Normally $130, you can snag a set for $80. For this price, they’re a good value since they feature Bose noise reduction technology and can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21593991/amazon-alexa-echo-buds-workouts-fitness-tracking-wireless-headphones"&gt;now track your workouts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bS5miI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="tMFYCi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNb6b8"&gt;On Tuesday night, SpaceX successfully launched another batch of the company’s internet-from-space Starlink satellites to orbit, using a very space-hardened Falcon 9 rocket for the job. This launch marked the rocket’s seventh flight to space and back — the first time SpaceX has flown such a seasoned vehicle to orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nyo1uA"&gt;The Falcon 9 took off at 9:13PM ET from SpaceX’s launch site at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, with 60 Starlink satellites in tow. After a quick trip to space, the first stage of the Falcon 9 — the bulk of the vehicle that contains the main engines and most of the fuel — separated from the rest of the rocket and came back to Earth. It then performed one of SpaceX’s signature rocket landings, touching down on one of the company’s drone ships in the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JNQo9b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;SpaceX has made these launch and landing routines a fairly regular sight out of Florida&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wmBB60"&gt;Before this flight, the Falcon 9 had boosted two communications satellites to orbit on two separate missions, and SpaceX had also used the vehicle to launch four separate Starlink launches. It wasn’t just the rocket that had flown before either. The rocket’s nosecone, which surrounds the satellites during the climb to space, was also used before for previous flights. One half of the nosecone — or payload fairing — had flow once before, while the other half had flown twice before this launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmL8WU"&gt;By now, SpaceX has made these launch and landing routines a fairly regular sight out of Florida, with each new mission adding numbers to the company’s resume. Last night’s launch was notable for being SpaceX’s 100th Falcon 9 launch ever. It also marked the company’s 23rd launch of this year and the 67th time SpaceX has recovered one of its Falcon 9 boosters following a launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5H0cQ"&gt;Those numbers are only expected to grow, with more launches slated this year. And with yesterday’s rocket successfully landing, an eighth flight is perhaps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why is the PS5 outperforming the ‘world’s most powerful console’?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DIzsONZakamoxOABRcuWbrTnrpo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980534/vpavic_4261_20201023_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Early game comparisons show the PS5 outperforming the Xbox Series X&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TKkLeZ"&gt;Microsoft has been proudly discussing how powerful its Xbox Series X console is for months now. There have been deep dives into the tech inside, promises it’s “the world’s most powerful console,” and even news that the company waited on a specific AMD technology to give it a mysterious edge over the PS5. On paper, the Xbox Series X looks more powerful than the PS5. But in practice early game tests show the PS5 outperforming Microsoft’s console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyNSRE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; has been analyzing a number of new games across both the PS5 and Xbox Series X, and the results are surprising. With the Xbox Series X capable of 12 teraflops of GPU performance vs. 10.28 teraflops on the PS5, most onlookers expected there to be a small gap between the consoles. Microsoft’s next-gen Xbox also has higher levels of memory bandwidth and more compute units, but Sony offers developers less compute units running at a variable (and higher) clock rate to extract better performance out of the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz7PDk"&gt;While the Xbox Series X takes a slight lead in 4K and ray tracing performance modes &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GIIhJqTERls"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the high frame rate mode runs noticeably better on PS5 with frame rate gaps between the two systems at more than 40fps in some scenes. “The dips look really strange to me, and it kind of suggests to me some kind of API limitation on the Xbox side where the GPU is being held back by something,” suggests &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; editor Richard Leadbetter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLEVPl"&gt;These dips matter because sudden drops mean a more obvious judder or stutter for players. Variable refresh rate displays can help smooth this out, but if the dips are significant then you’ll still feel the changes in frame rates either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="R7ebbK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GIIhJqTERls?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne9Wmo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devil May Cry 5&lt;/em&gt; also offers a ray tracing quality mode, where the Xbox Series X doesn’t show a significant lead. “I don’t really have any technical explanation for it, except the sense you’re getting here is that PlayStation 5 spec wise is punching above its weight, and something is up with Xbox — which on paper at least should be significantly ahead,” adds Leadbetter in the &lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MeFKKS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PS5 vs. Xbox Series X: a complicated battle of SSD and GPU speeds","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"},{"title":"PS5 vs. Xbox Series X: the next-gen consoles in photos","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535180/sony-ps5-playstation-5-photos-hands-on-xbox-series-x-comparison"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="NKBJiH"&gt;Elsewhere, Microsoft has a marketing deal for &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; so that every time you see it promoted in a TV ad, it’ll appear alongside next-gen Xbox consoles. You’d expect Xbox Series X would be the best place to play this new game on console, but the PS5 outperforms again. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rzaSrS1fsvc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt; found&lt;/a&gt; that the Xbox Series X version of &lt;em&gt;Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; includes a lot of screen tearing and regular dips below 60fps. The PS5 version appears to run a lot more smoothly. Variable fresh rates do make up for this screen tearing on the Xbox Series X, but you’ll need a modern TV to support that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbQ5A9"&gt;The Xbox Series X &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/hLUrgHWxWCU"&gt;also falls behind&lt;/a&gt; the PS5 in both image quality and resolution in &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt;. The PS5 version (in image quality mode) gets better texture filtering and the average resolution is a little higher, too. Over in the performance mode, which targets 120fps, the detail level on PS5 is far higher than the Xbox Series X. Codemasters has acknowledged the gap here and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidspringate/status/1330544631646457857"&gt;says it will be fixed&lt;/a&gt; in an upcoming patch. As the performance mode has higher textures on the PS5, the performance dips below 120fps more often than Xbox Series X, but it’s hard to compare these two modes without Codemasters fixing the detail-level discrepancies. Either way, variable refresh rates on the Xbox Series X certainly help smooth out the gameplay experience, but they shouldn’t really be needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="RREy3v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RnZAN91pUiw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XEqOJ0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; also demonstrates the differences between these consoles. It &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RnZAN91pUiw"&gt;shows an advantage&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox Series X in ray tracing performance, but Microsoft’s console falls behind in the 120fps mode. &lt;em&gt;Black Ops Cold War&lt;/em&gt; includes ray-traced shadows, which aren’t as demanding as ray-traced reflections, but they add some depth to scenes. The PS5 drops to 40fps in some scenes with ray tracing, where the Xbox Series X holds 60fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkDwoI"&gt;All of these comparisons show that the Xbox Series X isn’t outperforming the PS5 in most scenarios, and it’s often Sony’s console taking the lead. Some of these differences could be down to bugs, but I’ve been speaking to developers (who wish to remain anonymous) about the Xbox Series X development environment and it’s clear things are a little complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LawLqq"&gt;Microsoft only allowed developers to submit games for Xbox Series X certification in June, after delivering an update to its Game Developers Kit (GDK). That followed the company’s rather tight schedule for dev kit allocations, all while I’ve been consistently hearing that many developers had access to PS5 dev kits far in advance of Xbox versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uOc9tR3qk3VPMni_mJ33GETe5LM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21867255/twarren_200909_4177_0029.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X console.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLoik5"&gt;It always takes time for developers to get used to the new software and tools involved in creating games for next-gen consoles. One developer tells me Microsoft’s switch to the GDK has been troublesome for basic things like user profile switching or gamepad linking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT5Fux"&gt;Microsoft has spent years improving its tooling situation since the Xbox One, which was a messy launch period for developers. Still, I consistently hear that Sony’s tools are superior, even in the basics of providing more clear documentation for developers to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwPOGi"&gt;Not all developers are still getting used to the GDK, though. The team behind &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt; praised Microsoft’s GDK ahead of the Xbox Series X launch. “We started doing the groundwork for Xbox Series X development long before we even received the hardware,” said Codemasters technical director David Springate &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/06/10/inside-xbox-series-x-optimized-dirt-5/"&gt;back in June&lt;/a&gt;. “This kind of thinking from Xbox allowed us to get a real head-start on next-gen development, so after receiving our early Xbox Series X hardware, we were up and running really quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0kPE5"&gt;These performance gaps, weird bugs, and differences between the Xbox Series X and PS5 versions of games look like issues related to the games rather than a platform problem for the Xbox. If Microsoft delivered dev kits and tools far later than Sony, then it could take creators more time to optimize further for Xbox. It may also explain why we didn’t see a lot of Xbox Series X gameplay in the months ahead of launch, but Sony was happy to regularly deliver PS5 gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIjn5XjdB6PH1yq_-Ch2VLV78SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22012259/vpavic_4275_20201030_0033.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RVbatF"&gt;Expect to see a lot of game patches either way. Codemasters is fixing up &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt;, and I understand Ubisoft is working on an &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; patch for the Xbox Series X to improve gameplay. Microsoft is also working with developers to resolve issues and has acknowledged the comparison videos in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCL5po"&gt;“We are aware of performance issues in a handful of optimized titles on Xbox Series X|S and are actively working with our partners to identify and resolve the issues to ensure an optimal experience,” says a Microsoft spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As we begin a new console generation, our partners are just now scratching the surface of what next-gen consoles can do and minor bug fixes are expected as they learn how to take full advantage of our new platform. We are eager to continue working with developers to further explore the capability of Xbox Series X|S in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0CFjX"&gt;Microsoft also hasn’t explained why it waited for full RDNA 2 support from AMD for the Xbox Series X. Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast"&gt;revealed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently that Microsoft started manufacturing consoles in late summer. “We were a little bit later than the competition, because we were waiting for some specific AMD technology in our chip,” says Spencer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O98khs"&gt;Things have clearly been coming in hot on the Xbox Series X side, but the PS5 has also launched without variable refresh rate support to help smooth out any frame rate issues. These features and overall performance do matter greatly on these consoles as it affects how we all experience playing the games that developers create. The Xbox One consistently struggled to hit 1080p early on compared to the PS4, and while the differences aren’t that big yet this time around, it will clearly take months or even years to determine how this next generation of consoles will change the way games are played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHBEOH"&gt;Microsoft may have been beating its chest about 12 teraflops and the “world’s most powerful console,” but that hasn’t materialized yet. Despite this, I understand Microsoft is still quietly confident that bigger and more obvious performance gains will appear on Xbox over time, thanks to full RDNA2 support and its maturing developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKldrk"&gt;Exactly what “full RDNA2 support” will bring is still unclear, though. Microsoft hasn’t detailed why it waited for AMD or why full RDNA2 matters. This is all while AMD is still working on its super sampling technology that it’s promising will improve ray tracing frame rates and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics"&gt;could be available on Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JEjTMm"&gt;Ultimately, it’s the games that matter and Microsoft’s launch lineup has relied heavily on third-party games that aren’t backing up its performance claims. The Xbox Series X has been great at backward compatibility, accessibility, and accessory support, but Microsoft still needs to deliver more games from its Xbox Game Studios to really show the power of the console.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rGB7RG"&gt;Let’s be honest: gaming is expensive, but the holiday season is a good time to take advantage of deals and sales and buy more than one game. Whether you are adding games to your personal library for your backlog, or you are planning to buy some games for a friend or family member, retailers like Amazon, GameStop, and Target have various discounts on titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0KAAJ"&gt;If you are planning to buy a PS5 or an Xbox Series X / S on Black Friday, please keep in mind that both are in high demand, limited supply, and are receiving irregular restocks at retailers. But if you are looking for games on PS4, Xbox One, and Switch, there are many deals available right now. If you own a next-gen console, several of these games on PS4 and Xbox One are either backward compatible or include a free upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEBDg4"&gt;If you are looking for more deals on tech and gadgets, check out our article where we highlight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;the best Black Friday deals worth your time and money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s Back Button Attachment is a glimpse at the PS5 controller we didn’t get</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3x_iPVY3ncsLEERG0Hhv8il1UPg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980263/akrales_201028_4255_0093.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holoway Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IXC698"&gt;Over six years after it was first released, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025959/sony-back-button-attachment-ps4-dualshock-4-controller-buttons-accessory-paddles"&gt;Sony suddenly created&lt;/a&gt; a new set of buttons for its DualShock 4 controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2EvCE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025959/sony-back-button-attachment-ps4-dualshock-4-controller-buttons-accessory-paddles"&gt;Back Button Attachment&lt;/a&gt; was a bizarre product, both conceptually and in terms of timing. The vaguely wing-shaped accessory had two extra buttons and an OLED panel on the back that allowed players to add new functionality to their controller. And it was released in January 2020 — just months before Sony revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;the PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;feature-packed DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="anS9ux"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the PS5’s DualSense controller makes games like Fortnite and NBA 2K21 better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"},{"title":"PlayStation 5 review: a big, confident step into next gen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="uGz5wy"&gt;Sony’s sudden interest in offering back paddles on the DualShock 4 fit with existing trends in the console world. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Microsoft’s Elite controllers&lt;/a&gt; offered similar removable paddles, and third-party controllers with swappable parts and advanced configuration options like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/18/17992342/scuf-vantage-sony-playstation-4-pro-controller-review"&gt;Scuf Vantage&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311885/astro-c40-tr-review-sony-ps4-pro-elite-controller-features-price"&gt;Astro C40 TR&lt;/a&gt; had risen in popularity. Gamers, it seemed, wanted easier-to-reach buttons for triggering abilities on cooldowns in RPGs or for swapping weapons in shooters where every second counted. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K7hL2tZKciF2iq1Ac9MQietuM-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22048110/akrales_201028_4255_0070.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xu3NBM"&gt;But instead of making its own ultra-premium controller like Microsoft (its second-generation Elite controller costs $179, or more than half as much as an Xbox Series S console), Sony took a different tack. It released a $30 puck that could simply clip onto any DualShock 4 controller, offering the flexibility of the extra buttons without the need to buy a new and pricey pro-level controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXQzmh"&gt;As actual buttons go, the Back Button Attachment makes the most of its grafted-on style. The buttons — while not actual paddles, as seen on other pro controllers — are clicky and sturdy, and the whole thing slots together really nicely. The OLED panel (used for remapping standard buttons to those back buttons) is also a clever addition. It allows for all the remapping to be handled on the device itself, meaning that you’re able to use the Back Button Attachment on the DualShock 4 even when it’s connected to devices other than a PlayStation, like a phone or computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVE0fT"&gt;And at $30, it’s relatively affordable for someone looking to experiment with the idea of back-mounted buttons — assuming you can buy one (the attachment has been notoriously hard to find).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iyLF4MyJpHqsohaLX61nPkFV6Sk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22048111/akrales_201028_4255_0032.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BJsInw"&gt;But what I find the most interesting thing about the DualShock 4 Back Button Attachment is what it didn’t do: pave the way for the PS5’s controller to standardize back paddles. Given how late in the PS4’s life cycle it was released, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/what-ps4-back-buttons-could-tell-us-about-ps5-dualshock-5/"&gt;there was some speculation&lt;/a&gt; that it was meant to warm gamers and developers up for the next-generation console, which could feature fully integrated back buttons in its controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9gEUn"&gt;As the reveal of the PS5’s DualSense controller showed, Sony didn’t end up adding back buttons. In fact, the new controller isn’t even compatible with the accessory, nor did Sony announce a new version of the back button hardware that would work with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjNDym"&gt;Instead, Sony is exploring things like improved haptic feedback and triggers that can adjust their resistance — ways to make the existing functionality of the PlayStation controller better and more immersive, rather than just adding more buttons on. (Stay tuned in the coming months for a column that dives more deeply into the DualSense’s unique buttons!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b45Vf"&gt;It’s hard to say what the future holds. Perhaps Sony does have plans for its own Elite-style controller that will look to Microsoft’s pro-level controller for inspiration, with more customization and input options. Maybe there’ll be a back button attachment for the DualSense somewhere down the line. Or maybe Sony has viewed the entire experiment as a large-scale form of market research and decided that more buttons just isn’t the way to go for mainstream controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRs5A7"&gt;Instead, Sony seems to have settled on offering the same suite of buttons on its next-generation controller as it has for years, leaving back buttons — for now — as an interesting option that’s still stuck catering to professionals rather than mainstream players. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>1Password is offering a 50 percent discount on family plans for Verge readers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ERmyf--PIH9br0DEWjkQHKvskQM=/63x0:1938x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67980270/item_details_view.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Password was recently updated to support macOS Big Sur&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4cIIOq"&gt;In case you still don’t use a password manager, or if you’re looking to switch services, 1Password is offering an exclusive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/21569412/black-friday-best-early-deals-sales-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; offer to readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; until Thursday, December 3rd. You can save 50 percent each month on the cost of a family subscription (up to five people, and &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;restricted to a single household) to 1Password’s services, &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://1password.com/promo/black-friday/the-verge/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costing $2.50 per month&lt;/a&gt; for up to one year. After that year is up, you’ll be charged the regular $5 per month rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaQJCb"&gt;Having a password manager within reach is one of those things you didn’t know you needed until you try it. That’s just one feature that 1Password provides with a subscription: letting you access your saved, secure passwords through its app on Mac, Windows, Android, iOS, or via a web browser. Each family member can create their own account to see only their own passwords or join a single one if all of your passwords are shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="V0xLjF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"1Password family subscription","description":"&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Verge&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; readers who haven’t tried 1Password before can save 50 percent on a family subscription each month for up to a year. You’ll pay $2.50 per month.","label":"&amp;lt;s&amp;gt;$5.00&amp;lt;/s&amp;gt; $2.50","url":"https://1password.com/promo/black-friday/the-verge/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="04lgCo"&gt;In addition to syncing your passwords between apps, 1Password also handles encrypted storage for sensitive documents and images (up to 1GB shared per family). You can retrieve passwords you accidentally deleted, going back in time up to a year, and 1Password will also let you know if a site you frequently visit has been compromised. Plus, you can log credit card numbers, passport information, and more if you choose to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QqftH"&gt;Simply put, if you’re bogged down with which of your (likely very insecure) memorized passwords belongs to which site, it’s time to get a password manager. It’ll be hard to look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4hJhHl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"1Password updated for Big Sur with Apple Watch unlock support","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572169/1password-big-sur-update-apple-watch-unlock-icon-support"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="98mFS9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
