    <title>Leaked Galaxy Buds Pro image reveals new rounded design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgCgNHVtNnOgxTnlkTS6TNO0u8I=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68388280/galaxy_buds_pro.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKdq2P"&gt;An image of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro true wireless earbuds has leaked, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/first-images-of-the-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-1606914779-1"&gt;noted leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nokmco"&gt;You can see the apparent image of the headphones at the top of this post. They look to have a more rounded shape than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s an image of what the Galaxy Buds Plus look like, for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tn-fX96eR_5b9lex_3JWl0-94hI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137433/DSCF5554.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cBqOZS"&gt;Blass also posted a render that apparently shows the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro — a render looks similar to a diagram of the case found in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726569/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-fcc-regulatory-filing"&gt;recent FCC filings&lt;/a&gt; for the Galaxy Buds Pro. Instead of the more oblong shape of the case for the Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds Plus, the case for the Galaxy Buds Pro looks to be more of a square with rounded corners, like the one for Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;bean-shaped Galaxy Buds Live headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaked render of the Galaxy Buds Pro case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SsuHss"&gt;A new shape and new case aren’t the only new updates reportedly coming to the Galaxy Buds Pro — they may also have active noise cancellation and improvements to ambient mode, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/new-galaxy-buds-with-galaxy-s21-details/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Galaxy Buds Pro are expected to be revealed alongside the Galaxy S21 phones in January, &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Supergiant just released a 10th anniversary album of music from its games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LgzRUG34xr2Kdrpx2fr-5rYXhjo=/151x0:1770x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68387628/zagreus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Na4o18"&gt;Studio Supergiant Games has been in the business of making excellent games for the last decade — including &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pyre&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which each have received something like universal acclaim from critics and fans alike. Part of what makes those games so special is their soundtracks, composed by Darren Korb. And now Korb’s work is getting its own standalone anniversary release in the form of the record &lt;em&gt;The Songs of Supergiant Games: 10th Anniversary Orchestral Collection. &lt;/em&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://store.supergiantgames.com/products/the-songs-of-supergiant-games-10th-anniversary-collection-vinyl-standard-edition"&gt;preorder the (translucent red!) vinyl now for shipping in early 2021&lt;/a&gt;, or you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUHvI4dgY8w"&gt;listen to the whole thing on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDnmHa"&gt;The album was recorded at the hallowed Abbey Road Studios in London, and each track has a unique orchestral arrangement conducted by &lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt; composer Austin Wintory. Supergiant released a behind-the-scenes look at the recording process on its YouTube channel, which you can peep here. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google illegally spied on workers before firing them, US labor board alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="DOUNIAMAG-BRITAIN-IRELAND-US-INTERNET-SEXISM-COMPANY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9SrPTFVkBDFXXpI0DSVsKH98Vs=/0x0:5275x3517/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68381034/1056016666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p2PTlH"&gt;Google violated US labor laws by spying on workers who were organizing employee protests, then firing two of them, according to a complaint to be filed by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VABe0z"&gt;The complaint names two employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, both of whom were fired by the company in late 2019 in connection with employee activism. Berland was organizing against Google’s decision to work with IRI Consultants, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;a firm widely known for its anti-union efforts&lt;/a&gt;, when he was let go for reviewing other employees’ calendars. Now, the NLRB has found Google’s policy against employees looking at certain coworkers’ calendars is unlawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jU542"&gt;“Google’s hiring of IRI is an unambiguous declaration that management will no longer tolerate worker organizing,” Berland said in a statement. “Management and their union busting cronies wanted to send that message, and the NLRB is now sending their own message: worker organizing is protected by law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otelr5"&gt;Spiers was fired after she created a pop-up for Google employees visiting the IRI Consultants website. “Googlers have the right to participate in protected concerted activities,” the notification read, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/fifth-google-worker-activist-fired-in-a-month-says-company-is-targeting-the-vulnerable"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company said Spiers had violated security policies, a statement that hurt her reputation in the tech community. Now, the NLRB has found the firing was unlawful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kaHZL2"&gt;“This week the NLRB issued a complaint on my behalf. They found that I was illegally terminated for trying to help my colleagues,” Spiers said. “Colleagues and strangers believe I abused my role because of lies told by Google management while they were retaliating against me. The NLRB can order Google to reinstate me, but it cannot reverse the harm done to my credibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3sMtc"&gt;Google, once known as the happiest company in tech, has been roiled in scandal in recent years. The company &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;paid former executive Andy Rubin $90 million&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of a sexual harassment investigation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;which set off a wave of protests at offices across the globe&lt;/a&gt;. More than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18057716/google-walkout-20-thousand-employees-ceo-sundar-pichai-meeting"&gt;20,000 employees and contractors&lt;/a&gt; participated in the walkouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gD4WcJ"&gt;Workers have also protested the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;work with the Department of Defense on Project Maven&lt;/a&gt;, an AI initiative that could help the US improve drone strike capabilities.  In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/4/17199818/google-pentagon-project-maven-pull-out-letter-ceo-sundar-pichai"&gt;more than 3,100 employees signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; urging CEO Sundar Pichai to pull out of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube expands its Premieres feature with trailers and live redirects</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LQTbnooQ0rE3Xlp6qpSa1m2GFxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68378905/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6tdQkA"&gt;YouTube is building on its Premieres feature — used for live-streaming pre-recorded videos — by adding support for trailers, redirects from live pre-shows, and customized countdown timers. The company says there’s been an 85 percent growth in the daily use of the feature from over 8 million channels, and these additions might make Premieres useful in more scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubReQK"&gt;Premieres was designed to offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17490456/youtube-pre-recorded-videos-livestream-vidcon-2018"&gt;some of the benefits of YouTube live streams&lt;/a&gt; like live chat, but with the control of a pre-recorded and edited video. Creators typically use it to watch and respond to their subscribers while new videos debut. But as the pandemic has pushed film festivals and conventions online, Premieres’ use cases have grown. These new changes attempt to build on that momentum as online events become the norm by catering to some of the structure and marketing of traditional live events.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MKQY6jpgUYBT3lBm6nmGr9nc04=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137126/YTblog_BTSRedCarpet_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;YouTube’s simulated example of a live redirect from a BTS pre-show to a music video premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z0AGmC"&gt;The first of the new features is Live Redirect, which allows a creator with a premiere to hold a live stream prior to the video going live and automatically redirect viewers to it once it starts. YouTube imagines this filling the role of a pre-show or red carpet so viewers can learn and get excited about an upcoming video immediately before its release.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIco6cU1ck0oXELaP7UqNSqXQ8c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137138/YTblog_SetReminder_ClashRoyale_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a trailer advertising a premiere on its watch page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3mpOzS"&gt;The new optional Trailers are designed to fill in another pre-Premieres space, this time by looping a 15-second to three-minute video on an upcoming premiere’s watch page. Trailers could be used to advertise an upcoming premiere and entice potential viewers to set a reminder to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/esSVKL7PDsawMfFPXinDvXpTAiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137140/YTblog_CustomTimers_Mobile_FINAL_640x360.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of countdown timer themes that creators will be able to choose from to lead into their premiere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wC7D51"&gt;The final new addition is the ability to customize the countdown timer that plays before a premiere with a Countdown Theme. YouTube says creators will be able to choose from a variety of “themes, vibes, and moods” so that the timer better matches the content of the video, rather than YouTube’s default style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oodeCd"&gt;YouTube says Live Redirect and Trailers will begin rolling out to eligible creators today, with Countdown Themes available in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump’s bias hawk FCC nominee is one step closer to confirmation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Repeals Net Neutrality Regulations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vINDju8dW4kGwekhfIGByfoqQ5g=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68371117/892773228.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Samuel Corum/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vbZWdt"&gt;On Wednesday, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to advance the nomination of Nathan Simington, a Republican in favor of greater government oversight of speech on the internet, to the Federal Communications Commission. Simington’s nomination now awaits a floor vote for final approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONmarW"&gt;President Donald Trump nominated Simington to be the next Republican FCC Commissioner &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21438820/fcc-donald-trump-nominate-nathan-simington-commissioner-social-media-section-230-order"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. If approved, Simington would fill Republican Commissioner Mike O’Rielly’s seat, leaving the agency at 2-2 deadlock when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;Chairman Ajit Pai steps down&lt;/a&gt; on January 20th. Without a Democratic majority at the FCC, the Biden administration will likely have difficulties rolling through any major policy measures until another nominee is vetted and approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51kKbQ"&gt;In August, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21353233/orielly-fcc-nomination-withdrawn-trump-ligado-5g-230"&gt;abruptly withdrew&lt;/a&gt; O’Rielly’s renomination for an additional term at the FCC after the commissioner gave a speech opposing changes to Section 230, a hotly contested internet law the Trump administration has sought to repeal over the last few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bccnGI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This involvement to me sounds significant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sjASU5"&gt;Simington is viewed as a friend to the Trump administration’s desire to make changes to Section 230. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21431384/donald-trump-fcc-nomination-section-230-executive-order-bias-conservative?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; that Simington, a senior adviser at the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), played a significant role in the agency’s social media regulation agenda. When Trump signed his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;social media executive order&lt;/a&gt; in May, it required the NTIA to craft a petition that would call on the FCC to reinterpret Section 230. Simington confirmed to senators during his confirmation that he played a role in editing the petition and in public relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4aoNe"&gt;After Wednesday’s vote, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) called out Republicans for “rushing to approve” Simington’s nomination. Blumenthal cited answers Simington provided to his office following the first confirmation hearing, suggesting that the Republican played a more significant role in the Trump administration’s social media agenda than he initially let on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52MhOG"&gt;“We have learned that he sought to enlist Fox News to quote ‘help get the FCC on board, more quickly and thereby ensure a freer and fairer social media landscape, going into the elections this fall’ end quote,” Blumenthal said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmSov3"&gt;“This involvement to me sounds significant and I do not support his nomination,” Ranking Member Maria Cantwell (D-WA) said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U9Vv0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn6UnK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="9YBmOu"&gt;Discovery, home to HGTV, Food Network, and Discovery Channel’s annual Shark Week, is entering the streaming space with Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sLXTfv"&gt;Discovery Plus will start at $4.99 with an ad-supported tier, along with a $6.99 ad-free option. CNBC first &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/02/discovery-to-launch-streaming-service-in-january-for-4point99-per-month.html?__source=twitter%7Cmain"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt;. The streaming service will launch on January 4th, 2021. The company aims to bring the service to more than 25 countries around the world over the next year. Each subscriber’s account will allow up to five different profiles, and four concurrent streams. The company’s press release does not note if Discovery Plus will offer content in 4K, but notes it will be available on “major platforms, including connected TVs, web, mobile, and tablets” at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbdEhp"&gt;As part of the roll out, Discovery is partnering with Verizon to give a number of the telecom company’s 55 million customers a free year of ad-free Discovery Plus. New and existing customers on Verizon’s “Play More or Get More Unlimited” plan will get a year of Discovery Plus free. Customers on “Start or Do More Unlimited” plans will receive six months free. On the internet side, new customers who sign up for Verizon 5G Home Internet or Fios Gigabit Connection will receive a year of free Discovery Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NTKx8c"&gt;The company’s collection of notable brands is likely what executives are banking on. CEO David Zaslav spoke about the company’s approach at a recent conference, as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/discovery-to-unveil-global-streaming-service-strategy-on-dec-2"&gt;reported by The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/a&gt;, noting that “super fans” will want a place to watch their favorite personalities from their favorite shows on networks like HGTV (&lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt;, Joanna and Chip Gaines) or the Food Network (Guy Fieri, Ina Garten) — and then some. There are also plans for original content that would be exclusively available on Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOzvvE"&gt;“We have been aggressively driving additional original content ... we think you need a substantial amount of original content,” Zaslav said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9oJEV"&gt;In an effort to make a competitive play in the space, Discovery has prepped a number of original series to entice people to sign up on top of fan favorites, and will launch with over 55,000 episodes of television. Original content will “premiere 52 weeks a year,” according to Zaslav. A full list of originals &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/here-are-all-the-original-series-coming-to-discovery-plus-in-2021"&gt;can be found on &lt;em&gt;The Streamable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the exclusive originals that Discovery Plus will host include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rrzWxt"&gt;Four new &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiance &lt;/em&gt;shows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="emzYTz"&gt;A new &lt;em&gt;Long Island Medium &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RyvsMa"&gt;A new travel and food series starring Food Networks’ Bobby Flay and Giada De Laurentiis. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4VE3jn"&gt;New &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;series&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DsBg3P"&gt;A new series from HGTV’s Chip and Joanna Gaines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="H03zNP"&gt;Discovery isn’t a mammoth conglomerate in the same way that many of its streaming competitors are (Disney, WarnerMedia, ViacomCBS, NBCUniversal), but niche streamers have found their places before. Crunchyroll, which caters to anime fans, has more than &lt;a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2020/07/28/crunchyroll-crosses-three-million-subscribers"&gt;3 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Shudder, a streamer dedicated to horror content, passed the &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/shudder-hits-1m-subscribers-as-key-part-of-amc-networks-targeted-streaming-approach-1234582104/"&gt;1 million paid subscribers mark&lt;/a&gt; this year. The WWE Network has &lt;a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/investors/sec-and-other-documents/financials"&gt;more than 1.6 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9LbPK"&gt;Still, there’s no question that competition is tough, even for the biggest players. While Disney Plus may pass 100 million subscribers by the end of the year, and Netflix is likely past 200 million subscribers, new entrants like HBO Max and Peacock are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;seeing slower growth&lt;/a&gt;. Part of that has to do with newfound difficulties creating content this year because of the pandemic, but there are also concerns from analysts and experts that the space, especially within the United States, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/22011750-83a7-11e9-9935-ad75bb96c849"&gt;is oversaturated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9n6V7j"&gt;In the year that every company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536842/streaming-disney-hbo-max-peacock-cbs-all-access-warnermedia-viacom-nbcuniversal"&gt;pivoted to streaming&lt;/a&gt;, however, it’s no surprise that corporations like Discovery are trying to find new ways to pull in subscribers and develop recurring revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eakh1X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 2nd 12:33pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The story was updated to include additional information from the event. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Mandalorian is the perfect Fortnite character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0uaMnxb0Ruzy4bVw-ltaqJ6qEo=/384x0:3180x1864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68364890/Fortnite_20201202100316.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="my8bgx"&gt;Anyone who buys the battle pass for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;the new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gets a nice initial bonus: a playable version of none other than the Mandalorian himself. He unlocks right away, and in many ways, he’s in keeping with the game’s recent strategy of focusing on branded tie-ins. Recent characters have included everyone from Wolverine to Travis Scott, Harley Quinn, and Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten. But Mando also differs from those others in one key way: he’s just about the perfect character for the battle royale game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW7wb4"&gt;At this point, it’s not a new idea to point out that &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/11/25/20978320/the-mandalorian-video-game-comparison-disney-plus-fetch-quest-armor-upgrade"&gt;often structured like a video game&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a story about a bounty hunter going out on a series of fetch quests; every time he asks for help, he’s tasked with going somewhere else to either collect an item or kill a monster. He’s basically an armored version of the Witcher. And often, he’ll be rewarded for his efforts with new gear, either in the form of stronger armor or maybe a fancy new spear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPTTY7"&gt;It turns out, this is a perfect fit for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s new bounty hunter-focused season. In the game’s continuously evolving fiction, the island is now overrun with the greatest hunters from various realities, all doing... something to stop the pull of a time-bending event that resulted from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;an attack by Marvel supervillain Galactus&lt;/a&gt;. It’s confusing, but it works well with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s quest structure, where you’re constantly tasked with new things in order to unlock more gear. There are even new bounties, where you can talk to NPCs or grab jobs from a bulletin board, asking you to kill a specific player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq-euB_41WE6RcSYznVMmWNRpMM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22137155/Fortnite_20201202100942.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H2RN8q"&gt;Initially, Mando looks a bit rough. He isn’t the slick, shiny hunter he is in season 2 of the show. In order to get him to that point, you have to complete quests and slowly unlock new pieces of Beskar armor. It’s going to take a while. There are nine pieces to unlock, and one appears to only be available once you hit level 100. The same goes for Mando’s most important accessory: Grogu, better known as The Child or Baby Yoda, is available once you max out this season’s battle pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="72JcT2"&gt;It’s a bit annoying that I’m going to have to wait so long to watch Grogu sip bone broth while I’m in the middle of a shootout. But I love that this version of the Mandalorian feels so true to the character: he has a lot of cool gear, but it requires plenty of effort to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The original Fire Emblem is great on the Switch, but Nintendo’s retro strategy continues to confuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZKLn7Di9l748cAgJiPBUtRiym1s=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68362999/Switch_FireEmblemShadowDragonBladeofLight_Screenshot__1__2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VLsUZA"&gt;Like many longtime &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; fans, I’ve never actually played the first game in the series. 1990’s &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/em&gt; kicked off what has slowly turned into one of Nintendo’s most important franchises, a series that blends tense tactical battles with character-driven storytelling. It’s not my fault, though: the original game never actually launched outside of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YsyYR"&gt;Three decades later, that’s finally changing with the release of &lt;em&gt;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/em&gt; on the Nintendo Switch. It’s a solid, no-frills port that’s only $5.99, making it an enticing option for fans looking for a history lesson. But it also points to Nintendo’s increasingly confusing strategy for its large library of classic games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3odeR"&gt;First, the game itself. If you’re coming to &lt;em&gt;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/em&gt; after playing a more recent entry in the series — like, say, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — you’ll probably be shocked by how straightforward the original game is. It doesn’t have any of the relationship-building that eventually became a staple of the franchise. Instead, the focus is almost entirely on turn-based, strategic combat. You control Marth and a small army of soldiers, traveling to different kingdoms to ward off enemies. This almost always means defeating every soldier and capturing the castle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Up586y"&gt;There are some nice twists in terms of your goals and the map’s geography, and the game neatly interweaves story with combat. I actually found it surprising how well &lt;em&gt;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light &lt;/em&gt;holds up. It’s particularly great as a Switch game, where I can knock out a battle, or even just a few turns, whenever I have free time. While it’s mostly a straight port, there are some nice modern touches, including a rewind feature, the ability to bookmark mid-battle, and an option to fast-forward through the incredibly slow enemy turns.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lJu5bdDrzoH2goV9Vv2VAF4ots=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22134242/Switch_FireEmblemShadowDragonBladeofLight_Screenshot__2__2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="23fDWr"&gt;As much as I’m enjoying the game, I do wonder why it’s not part of Switch Online. Selling classic games individually is how Nintendo used to operate, of course, with its Virtual Console on platforms like the Wii and Wii U. But that changed with the Switch. In order to lure players to its fledgling online subscription service, Nintendo added a Netflix-like feature, featuring a growing library of NES and SNES titles to play through. It’s turned into one of my favorite things about the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKYRT7"&gt;In the past, Nintendo has even added unreleased games, most notably &lt;em&gt;Star Fox 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16383958/star-fox-2-snes-classic-nintendo-review"&gt;a canceled SNES game that first debuted as part of the SNES Classic mini-console&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21439181/donkey-kong-country-2-nintendo-switch-online-september-games"&gt;as well as &lt;em&gt;Mario Picross&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t originally launch in North America. These kinds of surprise releases are important to drum up excitement for any streaming service. It’s why Netflix spends so much on original series and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;Microsoft dropped $7.5 billion on Bethesda to beef up Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLkAZQ"&gt;Switch Online isn’t quite the same as those, but it still needs a steady stream of new (retro) releases to keep people subscribing. And it’s in the unique position where most of the games it announces as coming soon, whether it’s &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Super Metroid&lt;/em&gt;, are ones that fans are already familiar with. A release like &lt;em&gt;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/em&gt; changes this. It’s a rare surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GRX7vR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s remake of Fire Emblem Gaiden is a love letter to a 25-year-old strategy game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/18/15658120/fire-emblem-echoes-nintendo-3ds-remake-interview"},{"title":"An unprecedented Nintendo leak turns into a moral dilemma for archivists","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347074/nintendo-gigaleak-controversy-history-preservation-archives"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ng3Pa3"&gt;I fully understand that rereleasing the original &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; is more involved than most Switch Online titles. Not only does it have some new quality-of-life features, but it’s also a text-heavy game that had to be localized. So in some ways, it makes sense as a standalone release. But it would also be a boon for the subscription service, one that would help simplify Nintendo’s often frustrating approach to its own history that’s scattered across platforms and devices. (To make matters even stranger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;much like &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the game will only be on sale until March 31st, 2021.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2lpwU"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online solved some of this, with a steadily growing library that was easily accessible for subscribers, all on an incredibly popular piece of hardware. It’s also not hard to envision a future where that subscription follows you to future Nintendo devices, whatever they may be. Maybe one day I won’t have to repurchase &lt;em&gt;Super Metroid&lt;/em&gt; for every new Nintendo console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EBUs7"&gt;I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/em&gt; for fans looking to dig into how the series evolved. Playing the original &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; in 2020 is a fascinating experience that’s long overdue. I just wish the process of playing it, and the rest of Nintendo’s enviable lineup of classic games, was a little more straightforward. Now where is &lt;em&gt;Mother 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rfx9o"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Fire Emblem: Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches on December 4th on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Loon hands the reins of its internet air balloons to self-learning AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3L5QfgHf6vbTxM9Z6XCR0Z14X_4=/176x0:1864x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68363009/1_Xfj6pEzUM5Gw3UKUaEw2qQ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Loon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlNi09"&gt;Alphabet’s Loon, the team responsible for beaming internet down to Earth from stratospheric helium balloons, has achieved a new milestone: its navigation system is no longer run by human-designed software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LURoKH"&gt;Instead, the company’s internet balloons are steered around the globe by an artificial intelligence — in particular, a set of algorithms both written and executed by a deep reinforcement learning-based flight control system that is more efficient and adept than the older, human-made one. The system is now managing Loon’s fleet of balloons over Kenya, where Loon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315961/alphabet-loon-balloons-internet-kenya-telkom-4g-remote-areas"&gt;launched its first commercial internet service in July&lt;/a&gt; after testing its fleet in a series of disaster relief initiatives and other test environments for much of the last decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ahSxwf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Loon’s internet balloons are now piloted by an AI flight control system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Nsks"&gt;Similar to how researchers have achieved breakthrough AI advances in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion"&gt;teaching computers to play sophisticated video games&lt;/a&gt; and helping software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20914575/openai-dactyl-robotic-hand-rubiks-cube-one-handed-solve-dexterity-ai"&gt;learn how to manipulate robotic hands in lifelike ways&lt;/a&gt;, reinforcement learning is a technique that allows software to teach itself skills through trial and error. Obviously, such repetition is not possible in the real world when dealing with high-altitude balloons that are costly to operate and even more costly to repair in the event they crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6dYQwE"&gt;So Loon, like many other AI labs that have turned to reinforcement learning to develop sophisticated AI programs, taught its flight control system how to pilot the balloons using computer simulation, with help from Google’s AI team out of Montreal. That way, the system could improve over time before being deployed on a real-world balloon fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pwpsbo"&gt;“While the promise of RL (reinforcement learning) for Loon was always large, when we first began exploring this technology it was not always clear that deep RL was practical or viable for high altitude platforms drifting through the stratosphere autonomously for long durations,” explains Sal Candido, Loon’s chief technology officer and co-author of a paper on the new flight control system &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-020-2939-8%3Futm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_source%3Dcommission_junction%26utm_campaign%3D3_nsn6445_deeplink_PID100095187%26utm_content%3Ddeeplink&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F2%2F21811123%2Falphabet-loon-internet-balloons-ai-machine-learning-pilot#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published this week in the scientific journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/loon-for-all/drifting-efficiently-through-the-stratosphere-using-deep-reinforcement-learning-c38723ee2e90"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “It turns out that RL is practical for a fleet of stratospheric balloons. These days, Loon’s navigation system’s most complex task is solved by an algorithm that is learned by a computer experimenting with balloon navigation in simulation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDRUjr"&gt;Loon says its system qualifies as the world’s first deployment of this variety of AI in a commercial aerospace system. And not only that, but it actually outperforms the system designed by humans. “To be frank, we wanted to confirm that by using RL a machine could build a navigation system equal to what we ourselves had built,” Candido writes. “The learned deep neural network that specifies the flight controls is wrapped with an appropriate safety assurance layer to ensure the agent is always driving safely. Across our simulation benchmark we were able to not only replicate but dramatically improve our navigation system by utilizing RL.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2wN8n"&gt;In its first real-world test over Peru in July 2019, the AI-controlled flight system went head-to-head with a traditional one, controlled by a human-built algorithm called StationSeeker, that was designed by the Loon engineers themselves. “In some sense it was the machine — which spent a few weeks building its controller — against me — who, along with many others, had spent many years carefully fine-tuning our conventional controller based on a decade of experience working with Loon balloons. We were nervous... and hoping to lose,” Candido says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="utorro"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Even if it’s not the beginning of an Asimov novel, it’s a good story and maybe something worth calling AI.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KWvzxs"&gt;The AI-controlled system handily outperformed the human one by consistently staying closer to a device the team uses to measure LTE signals in the field, and that test paved the way for more experiments to prove the efficacy of the system before it formally replaced the one the team had spent years building by hand. Loon now thinks its system can “serve as a proof point that RL can be useful to control complicated, real world systems for fundamentally continual and dynamic activity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpuLcc"&gt;In his closing remarks, Candido touches on the concept of whether this type of AI is worthy of the name, because of how specialized it is and how closely it resembles a traditional but not self-learning, automated system like the ones that operate heavy machinery or control elements of mass transit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc2plo"&gt;“While there is no chance that a super-pressure balloon drifting efficiently through the stratosphere will become sentient, we have transitioned from designing its navigation system ourselves to having computers construct it in a data-driven manner,” he says. “Even if it’s not the beginning of an Asimov novel, it’s a good story and maybe something worth calling AI.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMh1vn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump calls for last-minute 230 repeal as part of defense spending bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iwxIC8"&gt;On Tuesday, President Donald Trump threatened to veto an annual defense bill authorizing billions of dollars in military spending unless Congress agreed to strip away a pivotal internet law that provides Facebook, Google, and Twitter with legal immunity over content posted by their users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pu5gVh"&gt;The result is a standoff holding up one of Congress’ most vital pieces of legislation and placing Section 230 under an unusually imminent threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="BTVSv7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MYfZRy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;A foundational legal protection for online speech platforms&lt;/a&gt;, Section 230 has become controversial in recent years, and there is growing desire across the ideological spectrum to reform the law. During the primary campaign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274812/joe-biden-donald-trump-twitter-facebook-section-230-moderation-revoke"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden said Section 230&lt;/a&gt; “should be revoked, immediately,” responding to concerns that Facebook was shirking its responsibility to moderate the platform. Republicans have taken issue with 230 for the opposite reason, seeing it as granting platforms an inappropriately broad license to censor speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCuOTi"&gt;The issue became particularly urgent for President Trump in the days after the election, when he used Twitter to spread &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550991/twitter-trump-stop-the-vote-tweet-restricted-election-interference"&gt;baseless accusations of election fraud&lt;/a&gt;. The platform responded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552471/trump-twitter-restricted-false-election-claims-moderation"&gt;labeling the tweets as misinformation&lt;/a&gt; about a civic process (a specifically protected category on Twitter) and restricting their reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAsbza"&gt;Now, the outgoing president has tied 230 repeal to defense funding, one of the few pieces of legislation that is seen as a “must-pass” by members of Congress. The National Defense Authorization Act primarily authorizes spending by the military and other national security agencies, so a failure to pass some version of the bill could have severe consequences for the nation as a whole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXnHMp"&gt;The “must-pass” nature of the bill makes it the perfect target for lawmakers looking to sneak their own partisan priorities (known as riders) into a bill that will surely pass by the end of the fiscal year. It’s a long-standing process for lawmakers, but rarely attempted for an issue as delicate as 230 reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nN2ThR"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1333965375193624578?s=20"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; last night, the president was unequivocal in his desire to attach a repeal of Section 230 to the bill. “Section 230, which is a liability shielding gift from the U.S. to ‘Big Tech’ (the only companies in America that have it — corporate welfare!), is a serious threat to our National Security and Election Integrity,” Trump said. He continued, saying that if the “very dangerous &amp;amp; unfair Section 230 is not completely terminated as part of the [NDAA], I will be forced to unequivocally VETO the Bill when sent to the very beautiful Resolute desk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofucSS"&gt;As of publication, the first tweet in Trump’s Tuesday night thread was pinned to the top of his Twitter profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QifOvG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’d like to start for the Blazers, but it’s not going to happen either,” said Sen. Wyden&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RIpWoN"&gt;This year’s NDAA includes a provision to rename 10 military installations that currently honor Confederate military officers, a policy President Trump has &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/trump-set-veto-defense-bill-over-renaming-bases-honoring-confederates-n1248467"&gt;strenuously opposed&lt;/a&gt;. In November, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/us/white-house-hints-at-deal-that-would-drop-confederate-leaders-names-from-military-bases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported that the White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, told NDAA negotiators in Congress that Trump could be open to signing a version of the bill that renamed Confederate-named military bases if Democrats agreed to repeal Section 230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7B5Dst"&gt;As of Tuesday, Republicans were also working to include bills like Sen. Roger Wicker’s (R-MS) Online Freedom and Viewpoint Diversity Act, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/senators-offer-slip-section-230-changes-defense-bill-a09f3428-ce5f-468c-8127-5fc413c996a7.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But Wicker’s bill doesn’t amount to a full repeal of the tech industry’s liability shield, and it’s unclear whether the White House would support a version of the NDAA with Wicker’s bill as a rider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5avoh"&gt;The NDAA is typically approved by veto-proof majorities. So even if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) would agree to placing this year’s NDAA on the floor, Congress could easily overrule Trump’s veto. But according to reporting from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;last month, McConnell has a policy against taking bills to the Senate floor for a vote when they’ve &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/01/trump-repeal-section-230-ndaa/"&gt;received a veto threat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayvaGO"&gt;Still, some lawmakers, including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), one of the original architects of Section 230, seem to think that Trump’s 230 threat holds little weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PADjWG"&gt;“I’d like to start for the Blazers, but it’s not going to happen either,” Wyden said in a statement Wednesday. “It is pathetic that Trump refuses to help unemployed workers, while he spends his time tweeting unhinged election conspiracies and demanding Congress repeal the foundation of free speech online.”&lt;/p&gt;
