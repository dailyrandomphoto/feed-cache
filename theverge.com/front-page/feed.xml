    <title>India sets stricter rules for social media giants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwgwrZfUbZLbrAbHbYSMR1KgLJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873325/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PK6KR"&gt;India has announced new regulations for social networks and other web services in the country, particularly “significant social media” companies with large user bases, like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UowV5d"&gt;India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1700749"&gt;announced the rules&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;a href="https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/feb/doc202122521.pdf"&gt;They require social media companies&lt;/a&gt; to establish a “grievance redressal mechanism” for users, including official “grievance officers” who acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve them within 15 days. Services must also remove nudity and sexually explicit content within 24 hours of a user flagging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sr9Ojb"&gt;“Significant social media intermediaries” face additional responsibilities. These companies must appoint India-based officials that work with law enforcement and publish a monthly report on their moderation activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATXRbE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guidelines for Social Media Platforms &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Grievance redressal mechanism should be developed and there should be a Grievance Redressal Officer &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should be registered within 24 hours and disposed in 15 days: Union Minister &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@rsprasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ResponsibleFreedom?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ResponsibleFreedom&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTTGuideline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OTTGuideline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8A0DQycQqe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8A0DQycQqe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PIB India (@PIB_India) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PIB_India/status/1364882870876078092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0pfFF"&gt;“Significant” messaging-focused services must also be ready to identify the “first originator” of a message — a regulation likely aimed at Facebook’s highly popular WhatsApp service. Indian regulators have &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/india-likely-to-force-facebook-whatsapp-to-identify-the-originator-of-messages/"&gt;previously asked WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; to identify the sources of anonymous rumors that have sparked violence, but WhatsApp has argued this would compromise its end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="atree3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Messaging services would have to identify the “first originator” of a message&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqte4K"&gt;The framework also indicates that MEITY can regulate digital media services, including video streaming platforms, and require digital news services to follow the official “norms of journalistic conduct” observed by traditional media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Lq8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-whatsapp-and-twitter-face-new-rules-in-india-11614250424?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MEITY head Ravi Shankar Prasad said the rules were meant to make social media companies “more responsible and more accountable” for content on their platforms. American social media companies have struggled to navigate problems with violence, hate speech, and political conflict in India. Facebook’s local policy chief Ankhi Das &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536149/ankhi-das-facebook-india-resigned-quit-bjp-hindu-muslim-conflict"&gt;resigned last year&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from activists, and earlier this month, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276479/twitter-free-speech-india-protests-government-block-orders"&gt;clashed with MEITY&lt;/a&gt; over an order to block activists who criticized India’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmkFzX"&gt;India has tightened its overall regulation of foreign web companies over the past year. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html"&gt;it banned TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and other Chinese social apps, citing a threat to “national sovereignty.” TikTok reduced its staff in India last month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;move characterized as&lt;/a&gt; “essentially withdrawing” from the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music is now available on Google TV and Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEm_Rx2NX7y3F1DiST03L85LKY8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873307/amazon_music_android_tv.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pei3Ud"&gt;Amazon Music is finally coming to Google’s set-top box operating systems, with a new app rolling out for Google TV (currently just available on the latest Chromecast) and Android TV starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOyfjS"&gt;The app will function similarly to Amazon Music on other devices. Subscribers to Amazon Music Unlimited (which costs $7.99 per month for Prime members or $9.99 per month) will be able to access the full music library, similar to Spotify or Apple Music. Regular Prime Members will get access to a curated list of songs and playlists, while users without any subscriptions will get access to Amazon Music’s ad-supported options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0zw4"&gt;It’s by no means the first music app on Google’s hardware — in addition to Google’s own offerings, services like Spotify and Tidal also have apps there — but it’s a useful option for anyone subscribing to Amazon’s service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIhMgy"&gt;The rollout of Amazon Music on Google’s smart TV hardware is particularly notable given that Amazon and Google had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices"&gt;previously spent years&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2017 and 2018, feuding over content services for their products. That fight resulted in things like Amazon pulling Prime Video from Google devices and Google pulling YouTube from Amazon hardware. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;had mostly made up by 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though, when YouTube and Prime Video apps returned to Amazon and Google’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu6DFa"&gt;Still, the fact that Google is willing to tolerate a direct competition like Amazon Music (which faces squarely up against YouTube Music) is a good sign that the companies have turned over a new leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOb7k"&gt;The new Amazon Music app is available today in the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Framework Laptop is an upgradable, customizable 13-inch notebook coming this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop angled slightly to the right, seen from above. The screen displays mountains and a valley. On either side are a number of modules." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZsuGqqQPDJ2pGwpxehX2CQXD-0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873261/studio_image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTYY5u"&gt;A San Francisco-based startup called &lt;a href="https://frame.work/"&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; has just launched an ambitious project: a thin, lightweight productivity laptop that it claims can be “upgraded, customized, and repaired in ways that no other notebook can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5g2L1"&gt;Framework founder Nirav Patel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company aims to address his long-standing frustrations with consumer technology companies. Patel was one of the original Oculus employees and has worked for Apple as well. During that time, he says he “saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyx41p"&gt;“As a consumer electronics company, your business model effectively depends on churning out constant tons of hardware and pushing it into channels, and into market, and into consumers’ hands, and then sort of dropping it and letting it exist out there,” Patel explains. “It encourages waste and inefficiency, and ultimately environmental damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7vfwb"&gt;To that end, Patel sees the Framework Laptop as more than a product — he sees it as an ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mPKmfQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mIh1O7__ho?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdVfGc"&gt;The Framework comes with a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 screen, a 1080p 60fps webcam, a 57Wh battery, and a 2.87-pound aluminum chassis. Inside, you’ll get 11th Gen Intel processors, up to 64GB of DDR4 memory, and “4TB or more” of Gen4 NVMe storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzOWjz"&gt;As is the case with all kinds of consumer laptops, buyers can swap out and upgrade various internal parts of the Framework, including the RAM, battery, and storage. The company is trying to bring three additional benefits to the table. The first is that you can also customize and upgrade external components of the chassis, including the keyboard, screen, bezels (which are magnetically attached), and ports (via an expansion card system). If you’re someone who hates dongles and docks, you can select four ports from an assortment that includes the usual suspects (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Kh1In"&gt;The second is that Framework will be selling its own modules in a centralized online marketplace, which is also open to third-party sellers and resellers. The idea is that if your screen cracks or you feel like changing your bezels, you can hop onto Framework’s site to find replacements that are custom-made for your laptop rather than having to search around. Framework’s components are printed with QR codes that, when scanned, will bring you straight to a purchase page for their upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkPQlE"&gt;The third is that in addition to a pre-built Framework system, you can purchase a “DIY” kit of your selected parts, which you can then use to assemble the laptop yourself. The DIY Edition provides some operating system flexibility: you can install “your preferred Linux distribution” on it or your pick of Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user disassembles a Framework Laptop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WC53_XOuvk6Qm97MKZpxl0U9e58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327064/lifestyle_image_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="743HPU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHBeM"&gt;It’s a cogent plan, to be sure. But Framework won’t be able to achieve its upgradable, sustainable future just by announcing an ecosystem — it has to actually create an ecosystem that will last. And whether Framework will continue to manufacture modules for this specific laptop model far into the future, or whether third-party partners will pick up the slack, is certainly a question mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wMQC"&gt;If you’re any kind of PC enthusiast, you probably know that Framework is far from the first company to try a scheme like this. Intel has given modular computers a shot in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18643379/intel-nuc-compute-element-announcement-modular-upgrade-kiosk-laptop"&gt;to little result&lt;/a&gt; — its Compute Card was a commercial failure, and its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Ghost Canyon NUC&lt;/a&gt; (which had hardware partners on board at launch) still has yet to receive any new components. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware’s original Area-51m&lt;/a&gt; also never received its promised future-proof upgradable parts. Phone makers have tried modular devices as well: Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Project Ara&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, composed of Lego-style bricks that users could rearrange and swap in and out, didn’t go anywhere. The reality is that hardware is hard to build and modular hardware is even more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop closed, seen from above. On both sides are various modules." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NDC2V5K1M7ZOzbpEdUuZhIv4vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327217/studio_image_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sR9zxA"&gt;Patel, for his part, believes those OEMs weren’t committed enough. “Other companies, they put it out there, and someone internally decided, ‘Eh, we’re going to focus on something else this year,’ and shut down the project,” says Patel. “This is not something we’re dabbling in. It’s not a side project for us that someone thought was interesting. This is the core of our company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxzEg7"&gt;“We are releasing new modules, and upgrades, and accessories, and so on to drive the health of the ecosystem, and we’re going to continue doing that for as long as customers want us to,” Patel adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbQfdE"&gt;Framework will be taking preorders this spring, and the device is expected to ship this summer. Pricing hasn’t yet been announced, though Patel says it will be “comparable to other well-reviewed notebooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead is a big Vegas heist movie coming to Netflix — with zombies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz0nKUDsP0gPnmg8bswY-QaHqv4=/0x20:3000x2020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873204/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CLAY ENOS/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;Netflix’s next big-budget action movie is almost here: &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; from director Zack Snyder sees a squad of mercenaries battling their way into Las Vegas to pull off a massive heist. The catch is it’s set after a zombie apocalypse has ravaged the city, so instead of the usual Vegas barriers of casino security and mob bosses, the crew will have to fight through hordes of the ravenous undead to try to get the score of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ENAji"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t show off much, but we do know that Dave Bautista (&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;) will be leading the the show. Snyder, of course, is no stranger to big action films and zombie movies, in particular, having directed the 2004 remake of &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;(as well as his long list of superhero blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRpzjFXze5XZTqw2ixBHIl2HA4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328060/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Clay Enos / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OyMmy2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, however, is a particularly notable film for Snyder, given that it’s just the second wholly original story for the director — and his first in over a decade since 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHBcYf"&gt;Netflix is also betting big on &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; kicking off a new franchise for the streaming site: in addition to the main film from Snyder, the company also is producing &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: The Prequel&lt;/em&gt;, a German-American co-production directed and starring Matthias Schweighöfer (who’ll also appear in Snyder’s film.) There’s also an anime-style TV series planned, &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas&lt;/em&gt;, which will see several of the characters from the main film reprise their roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfXafK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Netflix on May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Post Malone cover Hootie &amp; the Blowfish for Pokémon’s 25th anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVQY8CH5_FkpyldUdIlTkSaTYS4=/0x51:960x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873199/Post_Malone_x_Pokemon_Publicity_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eL7JI"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone will hold a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;. If that combination wasn’t strange enough, today, he revealed one of the songs he’ll be performing: a cover of Hootie &amp;amp; the Blowfish’s mid-’90s hit “Only Wanna Be With You.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi8rVr"&gt;I’m not entirely sure how much crossover there is between Post, Hootie, and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans, but the song is definitely a real thing. You can listen to the cover in the video above, and The Pokémon Company says “the song will be included as part of Post’s headlining appearance” at the virtual concert, which will be airing on February 27th at 7PM ET. You can watch the live stream on both Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOXpBQ"&gt;Elsewhere, it also looks like we may be getting some big news from the franchise. On February 26th at 10AM ET, The Pokémon Company will host an event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pokemon"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, which promises “approximately 20 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; news.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First trailer for Pixar’s Luca follows two sea monster best friends trying to enjoy a summer in Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ji2T9KcRVTfoixTbJlARos-XUlA=/215x0:1298x722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873070/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_9.29.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qwYTTx"&gt;Trying to find friends can be stressful on its own, but when you’re a sea monster trying to blend in with the residents of an Italian town who just so happen to hate sea monsters, it’s even more anxiety-inducing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weimXu"&gt;This is the basic premise of &lt;em&gt;Luca&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;Pixar’s new animated film&lt;/a&gt; coming later this year. The movie follows Luca Paguro, a 13-year-old sea monster who wants to see what life is like above the sea, and his friend Alberto Scorfano, who loves the human world. Together, they take on human-looking forms and explore around an Italian town, trying to live a carefree life and enjoy the simple things that humans may take for granted, like bicycles and gelato. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbleHh"&gt;If that sounds a little like &lt;em&gt;The Little Mermaid&lt;/em&gt;, one of Disney’s most popular animated films, you’re not alone. Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;is likely going to become a story about love, friendship, and acceptance — themes often prevalent in Pixar and Disney films. Directed by Enrico Casarosa (&lt;em&gt;La Luna&lt;/em&gt;) and produced by Andrea Warren (&lt;em&gt;Cars 3, Lava&lt;/em&gt;), &lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;stars Jacob Tremblay (&lt;em&gt;Room&lt;/em&gt;) as Luca and Jack Dylan Grazer (&lt;em&gt;It&lt;/em&gt;) as Alberto. Emma Berman, Maya Rudolph, Jim Gaffigan, and Marco Barricelli round out the voice acting cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7sz9h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luca &lt;/em&gt;does not have a release date right now, but it’s scheduled for this summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple TV’s touchpad swipes and misses at being a good remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SabX-zpnBqRdZwClYeBz2FzeBXs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873060/akrales_210224_4406_0066.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vLMbFe"&gt;It’s rare to find a button that is almost universally hated, but the infamous touchpad on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9630952/new-apple-tv-4-review"&gt;Apple TV’s Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; might be the exception. Even over half a decade after its introduction, it stands as one of the most reviled pieces of hardware around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwJD7m"&gt;The failings of the Apple TV remote don’t just stem from a bad touchpad (and don’t get me wrong: it is bad) but from a larger misunderstanding on Apple’s part of what makes a good remote and the fundamental purpose of those devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvoWpW"&gt;The typical TV remote is big and ugly, but it’s also extremely easy to find and navigate thanks to differing patterns of buttons that make it clear what you’re touching even without checking. Generally speaking, no one has ever been too confused about how to find the giant rubber rocker that says “VOLUME” or what the huge, often glowing red power button does. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLS6K3kwl5u3N2_vz0zI62VUd8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326742/akrales_210224_4406_0053.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bcDXgq"&gt;Apple’s remotes have always been far simpler and smaller, but its older models still had distinct buttons for key features like navigation and controlling playback. And crucially, you could tell them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LfLoF"&gt;But the so-called Siri Remote broke from those designs when it was introduced alongside the fourth-generation Apple TV in 2015. The new Apple TV featured the biggest revamp of Apple’s set-top box ambitions to date, introducing its tvOS platform, an App Store, and the goal of becoming a one-stop shop for all your TV needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fVaRDb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iOS-style apps meant an iOS-style control scheme&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zzKoxi"&gt;The remote was designed to complement those ambitions. Most notably, the directional pad was removed and replaced with a featureless touchpad that was meant to more closely emulate the touchscreens found on iPhones and iPads. After all, the Apple TV could run iOS-style apps now, so presumably it needed an iOS-style control scheme to match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Kd2R"&gt;But in its pursuit of emulating the smartphone experience, Apple lost sight of the key elements of a good TV remote. The Siri Remote’s slimmed-down glass and aluminum design looked fantastic. In practice, though, the diminutive remote was even easier to lose than its already small predecessors, with a design that seems to be tailor-made for slipping between couch seats and underneath cushions. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBLrvP6y_4MlyyGfb7NPrHMZ8iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326745/akrales_210224_4406_0094.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nF9oVk"&gt;The minimalist design stripped the remote down to just just a few buttons, but the virtually symmetrical layout made it nearly impossible to distinguish between those buttons in the dark (say, when watching a movie). Pick up the remote the wrong way, and instead of hitting the play / pause button to stop your show, you might hit the TV button — which boots you out of the show and takes you to Apple’s overstuffed TV app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKfXK2"&gt;Add in software updates that have changed what those buttons actually do (the TV button used to &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-tv-remote-home-button-changed-by-apple-2019-9#:~:text=For%20years%2C%20pressing%20the%20%22TV,rest%20of%20your%20apps%20live."&gt;work as a home button&lt;/a&gt; until Apple released the TV app in 2019), and it’s another indictment of the remote’s chase of form over function. Even Apple seems to be aware of this: when it refreshed the Siri remote for the fifth-generation Apple TV 4K, it added a white ring to the menu button to make it slightly easier to tell which side is up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvqEWo"&gt;And then there’s the touchpad. With only its matte texture serving to distinguish it from the glossy grip of the remote, it suffers from the same orientation issues as the other buttons. Pick up the remote the wrong way, and you’ll either end up swiping on useless glass when you meant to move around the OS or flinging your way through a show when you meant to just grab the remote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wrMjWx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The touchpad is just plain bad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OKPeVA"&gt;Even if you can orient it the right way, the overly sensitive and opaque nature of the touchpad makes it easy to overshoot whatever it was you were trying to do in the first place. In theory, the touchpad is a useful tool for playing games, swiping through pages of apps, and effortlessly panning through a Netflix show. In practice, it’s terrible at nearly all of those tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPEDhE"&gt;The remote is such a problem that when Swiss TV and internet provider Salt started offering Apple TVs as set-top boxes, it worked with Apple to make a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/9/21002605/apple-tv-remote-salt-swiss-tv-company-replacement-buttons-normal"&gt;simpler, more traditional remote control&lt;/a&gt; to offer customers instead. One of the biggest changes is a swap from the touchpad to a regular, rubber D-pad. The touchpad promises limitless functionality, but it’s so hard to use that a &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; versatile input method is actually more useful. (The $20 Salt remotes routinely sell on eBay for nearly triple their value to disgruntled customers in other markets.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPb0i-Ad_mYulNmI0GmqC4rG5XE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326746/akrales_210224_4406_0105.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1BJpAo"&gt;But for all those issues, the Siri Remote’s failures all stem from a common cause: the smartphone-ification of the traditional TV remote. The svelte design and touchpad interface are things that helped skyrocket the original iPhone to its massive success. But for a TV remote — a device that needs to be easily found in a sea of throw pillows and function simply without requiring that you tear your eyes away from the latest episode of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; — they’re precisely the wrong traits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB7f1H"&gt;Apple made a remote control that’s an undeniably beautiful piece of hardware. Outside of the Siri Remote, how many TV remotes can claim to actually look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;? But the touchpad’s minimalism and misplaced attempt at trying to turn the entire remote into something that it’s not makes it like other failed Apple buttons before it: a stark warning of the dangers of chasing form over function. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where to buy Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N_xC0e_-R_mHspcZBFq1U1sCY88=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873032/shollister_200224_4441_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re sacrificing more than a little bit of performance compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21768294/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-when-where-how-to-buy-gpu"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LG09Kn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10360060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aSEuLX"&gt;So far, Best Buy and Micro Center are the only retailers that have put listings up for the RTX 3060. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reminders to stay cautious aren’t the biggest reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JcilQL1naohrtqRUXqIhHQf3xDM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873028/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cZr5d0"&gt;Esther Cohen is 91, vaccinated against COVID-19, and wants to play mahjong with her friends — who are also vaccinated. She &lt;a href="https://www.aaas.org/news/looking-back-and-forward-covid-19-anthony-fauci"&gt;asked Anthony Fauci&lt;/a&gt; if they could get back to their games after he spoke at the American Association for the Advancement of Science annual meeting this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue9yOU"&gt;Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said she should wait a bit longer and urged her to be patient. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/08/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html"&gt;was working&lt;/a&gt; on guidelines for people who’d been vaccinated because lots of people were asking the same question, he said — why get vaccinated if you can’t get back to normal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pc6w7k"&gt;Epidemiologists say the 44 million people in the United States with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine should keep wearing masks and keep their distance from others, at least for now. Some experts are worried that type of messaging is too &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/14/967807210/art-of-the-buzzkill-health-officials-struggle-to-boost-vaccination-stall-parties"&gt;pessimistic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/briefing/donald-trump-pardon-phil-spector-coronavirus-deaths.html"&gt;undersells the vaccines&lt;/a&gt;. They think it could make people less interested in getting vaccinated. If the predominant message is that life can’t go back to normal immediately, they reason, some eligible people might decide the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22279023/covid-19-vaccine-appointment-how-to"&gt;considerable effort&lt;/a&gt; to track down a shot isn’t worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQqJgg"&gt;That’s a real concern, says Melanie Kornides, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing who studies vaccine hesitancy. But she thinks it’s a less pressing problem than the other reasons people decline vaccinations and that once the shots are more widely available, people will be ready to roll up their sleeves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lxPU4G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vast majority of people still aren’t vaccinated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WvcD1y"&gt;Right now, there’s a good reason to tell people to keep wearing masks and avoid gathering indoors. The vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective, and there’s still a lot of coronavirus circulating through the country. The vast majority of people still aren’t vaccinated. Although early data indicates that people who get vaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/23/opinion/covid-vaccines-transmission.html"&gt;are probably less likely to pass the virus to someone else&lt;/a&gt; even if they do get infected, experts don’t know that for sure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1ZEfp"&gt;“Messaging that you still have to be careful after you’ve been vaccinated is important because it’s true,” Kornides says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfkVvi"&gt;Even if some people do balk at vaccination because of the continued precautions, they probably only make up a small portion of people who say they would hold off on getting a shot.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Kornides is surveying nurses, nursing students, and nurse educators about vaccines, and in early survey data, just 10 percent said that they thought it was unlikely that getting the shot could let them go back to their regular activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0mb7T"&gt;That tracks with the results of other, larger surveys. Most people who say they want to “wait and see” before getting a COVID-19 vaccine are worried about side effects from the shots, or about the speed of the vaccine development process, a Kaiser Family Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-in-their-own-words/"&gt;survey found&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL8Fr7"&gt;“We’ve been seeing all along, even before the vaccine came out, that they’re worried about long term safety, that they’re worried that the process was rushed, and that there are political motivations for not wanting to be vaccinated,” Kornides says. “Those continue to be the large majority of the concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9aX8J"&gt;People who feel less enthusiastic about vaccines if they can’t return to their normal life may also be younger, Kornides says, and not eligible to get vaccinated yet anyway. “It’s a pretty long stretch from saying that you’re not sure if you want to get vaccinated when you &lt;em&gt;can’t&lt;/em&gt;, to saying you don’t want to get vaccinated when it becomes available,” Kornides says. “If you have the opportunity to be vaccinated, you’re more likely to take it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WQbuhg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you have the opportunity to be vaccinated, you’re more likely to take it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrDnDa"&gt;Right now, the main challenge with the vaccination campaign is supply. There aren’t enough shots for everyone who wants them. Once supply catches up with demand, researchers and officials will start to get an even clearer picture of who is holding out and why. At that point, public health officials can tailor messages to specific groups to help people understand why it’s important to be vaccinated, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N11PhN"&gt;As the vaccine rollout continues, the CDC and other public health groups will develop more guidelines about what people can do once they’re vaccinated. Earlier this month, the agency said that people who are fully vaccinated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276905/covid-vaccine-quarantine-symptoms-test"&gt;don’t have to quarantine&lt;/a&gt; if they’re exposed to someone sick with COVID-19. Other changes are sure to follow. People will also start seeing the experiences of peers and others in their community who have the shots and who can adjust in subtle, comforting ways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3bYeF"&gt;One of Kornides’ nursing students who was vaccinated was able to end a quarantine earlier than her roommates. “These little bits of normality will make it worthwhile,” she says. The student may be able to ease up on some other precautions or have more peace of mind during everyday tasks like going to the store — and she may tell her friends about those small victories. “That can be a powerful message,” Kornides says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GHyef"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bUR9PN"&gt;California&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="h3AFk9"&gt;Massachusetts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeZogz"&gt;Another site, &lt;a href="https://macovidvaxhelp.com/"&gt;Massachusetts COVID Vaccination Help&lt;/a&gt;, uses volunteers to help eligible state residents book an appointment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="c9OpvY"&gt;New Jersey&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ijVYyv"&gt;New York&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 45 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vRg75P"&gt;Texas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NEM7f0"&gt;Washington&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hFMYTz"&gt;General resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There are several sites that aggregate the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available. &lt;a href="https://www.findashot.org/"&gt;Find A Shot&lt;/a&gt; also shows you possible openings depending on your state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jTJTFG"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), together with the Boston Children’s Hospital and other medical institutions, operates &lt;a href="https://vaccinefinder.org/"&gt;VaccineFinder&lt;/a&gt;, which was created to promote flu and other general vaccinations but is now dedicated toward helping people find COVID vaccinations. Currently, VaccineFinder is only available for people in Alaska, Tennessee, Indiana, and Iowa, but according to the site, it should be adding more providers in other states over the coming weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nhHjOx"&gt;If you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Reservation Of The Anticovid Vaccine For Over Eighty In Apulian Pharmacies" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4leCSmB_jTd6jhw7V_SvQQsfQ8Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299704/1231117569.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
