    <title>Spin’s electric scooters are coming to Google Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azukfR"&gt;Google Maps users will be able to find and rent Spin’s electric scooters after the Ford-owned company announced a new global integration on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frYEaJ"&gt;Starting Sunday, anyone who uses Google Maps will be able to see the nearest available Spin e-bike or e-scooter in real time, including how long it will take to walk to the vehicle, as well as battery range and expected arrival time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c11d8S"&gt;But to pay for the scooter, unlock it, and take their ride, users will be redirected to Spin’s app. Google Maps users will be able to see Spin’s availability in 84 cities, campuses, and towns in Europe and North America, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184vNn"&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit, bikes, buses, scooters, public transportation, as it is to get around with the car,” Spin CEO Ben Bear told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And until you’re able to do that, you’re not going to really drive the mode shift that we’re all focused on in the micromobility industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SKfVMb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0x1q3"&gt;Spin’s scooters will appear on Google Maps when users select the bicycle option after looking up directions to a specific location. They will also appear under the public transportation tab, Bear said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIK0cF"&gt;Spin is the latest e-scooter company to integrate its products into Google Maps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18248555/google-maps-lime-scooters-bikes-integration-expansion"&gt;Users have been able to find and rent Lime’s scooters since late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the city, the popular navigation app also includes available bike-share, public transportation schedules, and fare information for using Uber and Lyft vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLZjVg"&gt;Alphabet — which owns Google — is an investor in Lime, having contributed to a $170 million investment in the scooter company in May 2020. As part of that deal, Lime acquired Uber’s bike and scooter-sharing company, Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2S-KgsiM4mkyOgJM3S6pBqKv_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785627/SF_GoogleMaps_Press.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HUMscP"&gt;The Google Maps integration will help level the playing field for Spin in terms of competition with its rivals, Bear said. “Whichever is the fastest, most convenient option is what’s going to surface first, right?” he said. “So it’s really done in a fair way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suwP0m"&gt;Spin, which was acquired by Ford for $100 million in 2018, has seen its own shake-ups. Earlier this summer, co-founder and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"&gt;CEO Derrick Ko stepped down&lt;/a&gt; to assume a strategic advisor role, while the company’s chief business officer, Ben Bear, became the new CEO. Spin announced plans to add electric bikes to its fleet of shared vehicles, while also expanding to multiple cities in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmcRn9"&gt;Possibly spurring all this activity was a report that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Ford was considering divesting itself from Spin&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps merging the scooter sharing firm with a special purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMH0qT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this deep dive on why US public health data systems couldn’t handle COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Drive-Thru Covid-19 Testing Site As Biden Blasts Texas Governor For Surging Cases" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szJgnyKdRlQmgHV9Qrr3g5PSWx4=/0x3:7228x4822/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731912/1234463344.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5dTASv"&gt;Public health data systems in the United States are out of date, underfunded, and can’t communicate with each other. Those issues left states unable to keep track of COVID-19 spread, and during surges, many local health departments stopped contact tracing, according to a new investigation from &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NTc7U"&gt;The deep-dive look at the gaps in public health surveillance shows breakdowns at nearly every step in the process.  Labs that ran COVID-19 tests didn’t report data directly to health departments through electronic systems, instead using faxes or emails. Health departments used different systems to track different types of outbreaks and relied on programs that required laborious, manual entry. They couldn’t get information about cases through the system in time to intervene in outbreaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXfCTG"&gt;The challenges were exacerbated during COVID-19 case surges, &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;investigation showed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uDRovi"&gt;In Alabama, during surges, data systems crashed from an influx of cases hitting the system. In Vermont, more than 1,300 of Covid-19 lab results in December 2020 were received through fax, email or snail mail — not through the state’s electronic reporting system. In Washington state, labs were up to 10 days late reporting Covid-19 results during peak periods. In Wyoming, the state health department had to “deduplicate” thousands of records in its electronic system each month to ensure positive results were counted just once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Ahmv9N"&gt;The delays at the state level meant the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was sent inconsistent or delayed data. The federal agency had to build a program to scrape the states’ data sites for information, because they weren’t getting it from officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VxbYg"&gt;The shoddy surveillance systems were one reason the US wasn’t able to control the spread of COVID-19. “Because we did not have the kind of centralized intelligence to identify, test for and execute rapid containment, the U.S. missed our opportunity to contain the virus,” Charity Dean, California’s former assistant director of the Department of Public Health, told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFy4HU"&gt;Investment from the CARES Act could help modernize systems, but officials say it’s not enough. The problems that plagued health departments last year are still a problem today, officials are exhausted, and the delta surge is making things even harder to manage — much less fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmnsYp"&gt;Go read the full story &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/15/inside-americas-covid-data-gap-502565"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 to get easy perk resets to entice players back into Night City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/otOG1G7KRNUx-5elWHIFzwCw3as=/48x0:1668x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731887/screen_ripperdoc_clinic_en.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Viktor, a character in &lt;/em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwZOyo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will let you more easily reset your character’s perks in the upcoming 1.3 patch, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/39089/whats-new-in-night-city-patch-1-3-development-insight"&gt;new blog post from developer CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt;. The new feature arrives ahead of the next-gen upgrade set to hit sometime this year and could be useful for anyone who wants to dive back into the game and switch up how their character plays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vt8fyr"&gt;You can see the new feature in action in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I49IfNvapkY"&gt;a video from the developer&lt;/a&gt;, which shows that you’ll have to pay some in-game currency to reset your perks. You can already reset your perks, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/How_to_Reset_Perks"&gt;but it’s quite expensive to do so&lt;/a&gt; — this new option seems to be much more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dNwFzv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I49IfNvapkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9h9xE"&gt;It appears that the reset feature doesn’t let you switch up your attributes (the five main traits in the game’s skill tree that house the different perks) so it doesn’t seem like you’ll be able to entirely respec your character. But if you feel like you haven’t picked the right perks or just want to build your character differently, the reset feature seems like it will offer a cheaper way to mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HD7rqS"&gt;Patch 1.3 also looks to bring a welcome improvement to the mini map you see while driving. In the new update, the mini map &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fNsSBER4fE&amp;amp;t=43s"&gt;appears to be more zoomed out than it was before&lt;/a&gt;. I regularly careened past turns because they appeared with little warning on the map, so this change will hopefully make it easier to know where you need to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wlnQGC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I49IfNvapkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TjgTz4"&gt;CD Projekt Red hasn’t shared a release date for patch 1.3, but the developer promises that a full list of 1.3 changes is “coming soon,” so perhaps the update is imminent. The studio has released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;its troubled launch&lt;/a&gt;, and the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;latest roadmap&lt;/a&gt; (last updated July 1st) indicates that free DLCs and a free next-gen console update are scheduled to be released sometime this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boyfriend Dungeon will update its content warning after player concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GeVNpy6HMdz5c1nrhSIwEWOeGDQ=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731575/Copy_of_bfdungeon.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kitfox Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abCK1C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is getting an update, but not to its gameplay. In response to players’ concerns that the current content warning doesn’t go far enough, &lt;a href="https://www.kitfoxgames.com/en"&gt;Kitfox Games&lt;/a&gt; tweeted on Saturday that it would update the message next week. The developer says that right now the warning, “inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="10Uef7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The content warning for Boyfriend Dungeon inadequately describes the events of stalking and emotional manipulation that exist in the story. We'll update the game next week with a more accurate CW. We apologize for any hurt inflicted by our mistake. Thank you for playing!&lt;/p&gt;— Kitfox Games   BOYFRIEND DUNGEON OUT NOW (@KitfoxGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KitfoxGames/status/1426600404423520285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="djKL70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; is a dating sim / dungeon crawler in which players can build a relationship or romance with a number of sharp, dressed swords. Days after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619888/nintendo-switch-indie-world-showcase-axiom-verge-2-boyfriend-dungeon"&gt;game’s surprise release&lt;/a&gt; last Wednesday, people started voicing concerns on social media about a plot element that involves one of the characters stalking and emotionally manipulating the player. People took issue that the content warning that pops up when loading a new game doesn’t adequately address the potentially triggering elements players might be subjected to. They were also concerned that some of the plot’s darker themes weren’t communicated well enough in the game’s advertising and Kickstarter campaign. Right now, the content warning reads like this:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Content warning in Boyfriend Dungeon that states, “This game may included references to unwanted advances, stalking, and other forms of emotional manipulation. Play with care.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twBLBW9pX-HPY0G95gYb1khLbL8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785390/E8680YgVIAsWA2B.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;em&gt;’s original content warning.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dXzesU"&gt;It is not unusual for developers to update or implement content warnings in response to evolving attitudes about player protections and consent. Earlier this year, Team Salvato released &lt;a href="https://ddlc.plus/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — an expanded version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/24/16807866/doki-doki-literature-club-dating-sim-horror-short-play"&gt;deceptively unsettling &lt;em&gt;Doki Doki Literature Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — which included enhanced &lt;a href="http://teamsalvato.com/blog/updates-to-content-warnings-in-ddlc-plus/"&gt;content warnings&lt;/a&gt; that were not present in the original release. The updated content warnings allowed players to choose how much they wanted to be spoiled about the plot in order to make an informed decision on whether to play. The game also included a setting that would warn the player in-game whenever they were about to experience potentially upsetting content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkvZJT"&gt;After Kitfox Games’ announcement, some players were still concerned and expressed a desire for the developer to implement a feature that will let players opt out of the problematic content altogether. &lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt; already has a feature like this in which players can choose to not receive texts from the player’s mom. However, opting out of text messages is different from opting out of portions of the story since the text messages are not critical to the plot.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin sues NASA, escalating its fight for a Moon lander contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin New Shepard Space Vehicle Flies The Billionaire And Other Passengers To Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4mMcmwcdp4T4Qw4_drlynQ76AAU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731346/1329737107.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7m4WLf"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin brought its fight against NASA’s Moon program to federal court on Monday, doubling down on accusations that the agency wrongly evaluated its lunar lander proposal. The complaint escalates a monthslong crusade by the company to win a chunk of lunar lander funds that was only given to its rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX and comes weeks after Blue Origin’s first protest over the Moon program was squashed by a federal watchdog agency. Now in court, Blue Origin’s challenge could trigger another pause to SpaceX’s contract and a new lengthy delay to NASA’s race to land astronauts on the Moon by 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74nxOm"&gt;Blue Origin’s complaint, filed with the US Court of Federal Claims, was shrouded behind a protective order but was described as a challenge to “NASA’s unlawful and improper evaluation of proposals submitted under the” the Moon competition, lawyers for Blue Origin said in a separate filing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K14A58"&gt;Blue Origin was one of three firms vying for a contract to land NASA’s first astronauts on the Moon since 1972. In April, NASA shelved the company’s $5.9 billion proposal of its Blue Moon landing system and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;went with SpaceX’s $2.9 billion Starship proposal instead&lt;/a&gt;, opting to pick just one company for the project after saying it might pick two. Limited funding from Congress only allowed one contract, NASA has argued. The contract involves two lunar landings — one test landing without humans, and another with humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLMyXX"&gt;A spokesperson for Blue Origin called the lawsuit “an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA’s Human Landing System,” adding: “We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.” NASA wasn’t immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5hGIT"&gt;Blue Origin filed a protest with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in April, less than two weeks after SpaceX’s award was announced, arguing NASA should’ve canceled or changed the terms of the program when it learned it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two separate contracts. It also alleged NASA unfairly negotiated the terms of SpaceX’s proposal before making the award, without giving the same opportunities to Blue Origin and Dynetics. The GAO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602082/nasa-gao-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-lunar-lander"&gt;rejected those arguments&lt;/a&gt; in late July and deemed NASA’s decision fair and lawful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="btFnvk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blue Origin planning to ask for a pause to SpaceX’s contract during the lawsuit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="essnOH"&gt;That protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;prevented&lt;/a&gt; SpaceX from starting its contract for 95 days while the GAO adjudicated the case. Now in federal claims court, Blue Origin’s latest challenge could trigger another delay. The company alerted the court last week of its impending lawsuit and signaled to the judge that it will seek an order to pause SpaceX’s contract while the case is adjudicated, according to a person familiar with the notice who’s not authorized to speak publicly about litigation. If the judge grants Blue Origin’s request, the pause to SpaceX’s contract could potentially last even longer and put &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618275/nasa-spacesuits-delay-inspector-general-report-2024-artemis"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; dent in the timeline of NASA’s Artemis program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXM4L3"&gt;Blue Origin pitched its Blue Moon lunar lander with a “National Team” of established aerospace contractors that included Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, signaling that the technical expertise from those companies would fill in for Blue Origin’s limited spaceflight experience. The company has launched and landed its reusable suborbital space tourism rocket New Shepard roughly 16 times, with its first crewed flight taking place in July with Bezos and three others aboard. Engineering lessons from New Shepard will help guide Blue Origin’s approach for its lunar landing segment of Blue Moon, Bezos has said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiVrk0"&gt;After losing its GAO protest, Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;waved its frustration out in the open&lt;/a&gt; through statements and snarky white papers dangling the prospect of another legal fight in court and attacking SpaceX’s Starship system as inefficient. “We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision,” the company said in a statement after the GAO ruling, “but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction.” In one infographic posted on its website, Blue Origin targeted SpaceX’s Starship system directly, saying “there are an unprecedented number of technologies, developments, and operations that have never been done before for Starship to land on the Moon.” One critique cast SpaceX’s proposal as overly complex, noting it would take 16 separate Starship launches for each Moon landing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLWL4Q"&gt;Musk defended this approach in response to Blue’s critiques on Twitter, saying “16 flights is extremely unlikely” and that a “max of 8” launches would be required for one Starship lunar landing.” The rocket system, as proposed to NASA, would require several launches of a fuel tanker version of Starship that would, through some proprietary fueling depot floating in Earth orbit, supply fuel to a lunar lander version of Starship before trekking to the Moon’s surface, according to the GAO. Musk defended this approach in responses to Blue’s critiques on Twitter, saying “16 flights is extremely unlikely” and that a “max of 8” launches would be required for one Starship lunar landing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uePURE"&gt;“However, even if it were 16 flights with docking, this is not a problem. SpaceX did more than 16 orbital flights in first half of 2021 &amp;amp; has docked with Station (much harder than docking with our own ship) over 20 times.” Then, in another tweet, he threw in some snark at Blue Origin: “The sad thing is that even if Santa Claus suddenly made their hardware real for free, the first thing you’d want to do is cancel it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZvMu0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgSRJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel enters the PC gaming GPU battle with Arc</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ns2B-1w_CDkHIv8RdT8GY5lh1Ao=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731009/intelarc.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel Arc is the new branding for Intel’s GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4hTrhC"&gt;Intel is branding its upcoming consumer GPUs as Intel Arc. This new &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/visual-technology/arc-discrete-graphics.html"&gt;Arc brand&lt;/a&gt; will cover both the hardware and software powering Intel’s high-end discrete GPUs, as well as multiple hardware generations. The first of those, known previously as DG2, is expected to arrive in the form of codename “Alchemist” in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PI64lk"&gt;Intel’s Arc-based Alchemist GPUs will be available in both desktops and notebooks in early 2022, with Intel seemingly aiming to compete against both AMD and Nvidia here. While we still don’t know much about the performance of the first Alchemist GPUs, Intel &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/introducing-discrete-graphics-brand-intel-arc.html#gs.8iunf6"&gt;published a teaser video&lt;/a&gt; today that showed prototype silicon powering &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Psychonauts 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTz6e3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here's a sneak peek of pre-production Intel Arc graphics in action. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VOMsMN6r2y"&gt;https://t.co/VOMsMN6r2y&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntelArc?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IntelArc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/b9fOsXdRCq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/b9fOsXdRCq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Intel Graphics (@IntelGraphics) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IntelGraphics/status/1427262530594869258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BLdrhz"&gt;Intel’s Arc GPUs will be capable of mesh shading, variable rate shading, video upscaling, and real-time ray tracing. Most importantly, Intel is also promising AI-accelerated super sampling, which sounds like Intel has its own competitor to Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545441/amd-dlss-fidelityfx-super-resolution-fsr-supersampling-tests-benchmarks"&gt;AMD launched its own FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)&lt;/a&gt; answer to DLSS in June, but it’s only using a spatial upscaling technique rather than AI-based temporal upscaling. The aim of all these technologies is to upscale games from a lower resolution to provide smoother frame rates without a noticeable compromise in image quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ABCb60"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"These are Intel’s first Iris Xe desktop GPUs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"},{"title":"Intel’s new desktop GPUs won’t work in AMD systems ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252534/intel-desktop-gpu-amd-support-systems-iris-xe"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YDFuuW"&gt;“The launch of the Intel Arc brand and the reveal of future hardware generations signifies Intel’s deep and continued commitment to gamers and creators everywhere,” says Roger Chandler, head of Intel’s client GPU business. “We have teams doing incredible work to ensure we deliver first-class and frictionless experiences when these products are available early next year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkXJzwXRgxaSm9AXfK7TGbbtygE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785211/intelarcchip.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Intel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intel’s first Arc GPUs will arrive in notebooks and desktops early next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vRGGXK"&gt;Intel is only teasing the brand of its Arc GPUs today and revealing that “Battlemage,” “Celestial,” and “Druid” are all codenames for its future generations of Arc GPUs. More details and specifics are planned for later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqgdKd"&gt;So far, Intel has launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251142/intel-iris-xe-graphics-cards-desktop-gpu-pc"&gt;first Iris Xe graphics cards&lt;/a&gt;, codenamed “DG1,” that use the company’s Xe LP architecture. These lower-power cards were mainly designed for pre-built workstations, instead of dedicated gaming rigs. Intel’s upcoming Arc GPUs will be based on the company’s Xe-HPG microarchitecture, which is a combination of the work Intel has been putting into its Xe-LP, HP, and HPC microarchitectures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How drones are changing our view of sharks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRgR1lcfwy_Xd4G7t6z-LupDFPE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730980/vlcsnap_2021_07_09_16h59m21s441.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Two sharks and a surfer off the coast of California. | Image: CSULB Shark Lab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LdUnh7"&gt;A quick Google search for “sharks” drums up a sampling of headlines of recent sightings. “Leopard Sharks Return to La Jolla Waters in Droves,” reads one, while another highlights a “cluster of juvenile great white sharks off Pacific Palisades coast.” There’s been a steady stream of these kinds of stories all summer: sharks swimming eerily close to unknowing swimmers nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9qOq67"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Drones are actually helping researchers dispel some misguided fears&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2zqARw"&gt;If there seem to be more shark sightings than ever, it may be thanks to drones. Aside from driving some scary headlines, drones are actually helping researchers dispel some misguided fears: it turns out that shark encounters aren’t actually so rare. People often don’t even realize when there are sharks around them, drone footage shows, and much of the time the sharks don’t seem to pay humans much attention either.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJl6AK"&gt;“It’s a little scary to think that there’s great whites out there. But at the same time, the amount of times I’ve been out here, I’ve probably swam with countless, you know, that have swam by. So I think ignorance is bliss in this case,” Robert Xaudaro, a surfer, told &lt;a href="https://abc7.com/great-white-shark-pacific-palisades-will-rogers-state-beach-california-population/10945063/"&gt;ABC 7 Eyewitness News&lt;/a&gt; last week in a story about the juvenile great white sharks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32bxXU"&gt;“The technology has really revolutionized and given us a completely different view of sharks,” says Chris Lowe, a professor of marine biology and director of the Shark Lab at California State University, Long Beach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IG2u38"&gt;Previously, researchers like Lowe could only hop on planes and helicopters to spy on sharks from the sky. That was a pretty pricey endeavor, he says, and was mostly used just to count how many sharks were out there. With drones, that’s all changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sHixM1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What they’re doing when they’re around people”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wX3bQT"&gt;“We have a low-cost tool that’s giving insight, kind of a bird’s-eye view as to what sharks are doing and more importantly: what they’re doing when they’re around people,” Lowe says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhX6o4"&gt;Lowe’s research team is combing through about 700 hours of drone footage that they’ve either taken themselves or received from others to study shark behavior and how they react to people. In one 42-second &lt;a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxvONjBWmvd00BXgFAPTCdK7Hk38Fs84/view?usp=sharing"&gt;clip&lt;/a&gt; taken off the coast of California, five sharks can be seen swimming next to three surfers in wetsuits. The people sit casually on their boards, legs dangling in the water, as the sharks pass them by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="awz3MU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pxvONjBWmvd00BXgFAPTCdK7Hk38Fs84/preview" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; picture-in-picture; gyroscope;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hFQtR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video courtesy of CSULB Shark Lab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9RjEi"&gt;They’ve studied hundreds of interactions between people and young white sharks. While their research isn’t finished or published yet, Lowe has a cursory analysis: “It looks like so far, the sharks don’t care. They treat people as if they’re flotsam, just floating debris on the surface.” Basically, the sharks generally ignore people unless they’re being chased or harassed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzbj5B"&gt;That’s a relief given that human and shark interactions might be on the rise. Lowe’s research could ultimately inform authorities’ decisions on whether to close a beach if sharks have been spotted nearby. That becomes a tougher call to make if juvenile sharks are hanging out for weeks or even months at a time — potentially forcing beach closures that can harm local economies even if those sharks don’t pose a significant threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndd3JW"&gt;“From a public safety standpoint, there’s been no scientific evidence to back up any of this. And now for the first time, we have some science,” Lowe says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8S0axE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s part of the story. The other part of the story is climate change”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1qbNK"&gt;Shark populations are bouncing back in US waters after being dramatically overfished, according to Lowe. Sharks have been climbing back from the brink over the past 15 or so years. This year, Lowe says, that trend is likely coinciding with more beachgoers as people emerge from pandemic-induced lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaP2F8"&gt;“That’s part of the story. The other part of the story is climate change,” Lowe says. As oceans warm, white shark nurseries are moving farther north on the West Coast of the US to places that were previously too cold for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwDtYy"&gt;Toxic algae blooms can also push sharks into new places, as farming and industrial runoff make red tides worse. Hundreds of sharks surprised residents of Longboat Key, Florida last month when they crowded into local canals. The sharks were likely seeking refuge from a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/4/22606025/florida-red-tide-dead-fish-beach-algae-bloom"&gt;red tide&lt;/a&gt;, which sucks oxygen out of the water and can kill marine life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVMhVd"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aq1c9F"&gt;With more people and sharks running into each other, there are also more amateurs documenting with drones. &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-05-04/spying-on-california-great-white-sharks-with-drones"&gt;Recreationists&lt;/a&gt; have shared their shark footage with Lowe, although he’s quick to say that it’s best if citizen scientists are licensed drone pilots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGCkoW"&gt;Whether all this footage contributes to research or just winds up on YouTube or social media, Lowe says it has helped to cast sharks in a new light. The sharks are in their natural environment — not cast as the villain in a film like Jaws. “The bottom line is there’s no doubt that drones have given people a different perspective because they get to see sharks around people and see that the sharks aren’t attacking,” Lowe says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1w8T0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALXCAi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MFDDc1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s latest Fire HD 10 tablets with improved specs are $50 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R4YUf0oAhXaEuO1tyHetcIjmFf8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730908/Fire_HD_10_Lifestyle_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BXuxaC"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405230/amazon-fire-hd-10-2021-announced-kids-pro"&gt;refreshed its Fire HD 10 tablets&lt;/a&gt; in late April, and it added a faster processor and more RAM to make its biggest budget-friendly model a better value. Now is a great time to buy one, as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 with 32GB of storage and ads on the lock screen&lt;/a&gt; is $50 off its usual price, bringing it down to $100. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08F69779X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free version is $115&lt;/a&gt;. And, if 32GB of storage doesn’t seem like it’ll be enough, you can purchase &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0887P21Z2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an affordable 256GB microSD card&lt;/a&gt; that can greatly expand its internal storage for things like apps, movies, and more (it supports up to a 1TB microSD card).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7FeA4"&gt;The slightly more capable &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08F6FYN6B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; is also far less expensive than usual. Normally $180, it’s $130. This upgrade won’t be for everyone, but it has more RAM (4GB compared to 3GB in the standard Fire HD 10), a “soft-touch finish,” and wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JkHTfh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VS8y5n"&gt;Excellent deals on the Apple AirPods Pro aren’t too tricky to come by. They’re regularly $50 or slightly more off their usual $250 price, but seeing them selling for $180 is still rare enough that we thought you ought to know about it. That sale price is happening at Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;where they’re listed for $190&lt;/a&gt;, but $10 will be knocked off the total cost at the checkout page. At the time of publication, Amazon says your order will ship in one or two days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h1CYpd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Satechi makes all sorts of useful gadgets, like USB-C hubs and clever chargers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/9/22275296/satechi-double-sided-wireless-charger-apple-watch-airpods"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt; (pictured above) that plugs in via USB-C and is able to charge an Apple Watch on one side and AirPods on the other (though, not at the same time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LM07Q0"&gt;Whenever you find what you’re looking for, head to the checkout page and enter the code &lt;strong&gt;BK2SCHOOL20 &lt;/strong&gt;to reap the savings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government opens probe into Tesla Autopilot crashes with emergency vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Motors Inc. Tests Self-Driving Technology" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krvoEeQTYKLp8Mt8dZOff8tG_ZQ=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730744/494411550.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DVAEFF"&gt;The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=PE21020"&gt;opened a probe&lt;/a&gt; into Tesla’s Autopilot software, citing the cars’ repeated collisions with parked emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zHFFA"&gt;The NHTSA investigation will cover Tesla Models Y, X, S, and 3 vehicles released from 2014 through 2021. The federal agency says since 2018 it has logged 11 incidents (which include 17 injuries and one fatality) in which Tesla vehicles using the company’s Autopilot features, like Traffic-Aware Cruise Control, have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles. The agency says most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7tZNg"&gt;The investigation will “assess the technologies and methods used to monitor, assist, and enforce the driver’s engagement with the dynamic driving task during Autopilot operation,” according to NHTSA’s notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VZK3WG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An NHTSA spokesperson reminded the public that no commercial vehicles can drive themselves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gcPAnJ"&gt;A spokesperson for the agency said that the investigation was in its preliminary stages and primarily concerned with uncovering additional information about the incidents. The spokesperson noted that the public should be aware that no commercially available cars are able to drive themselves, and vehicles always require a human in control at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdkRfz"&gt;The inability of driving-assistance software from Tesla and other automakers to spot parked emergency vehicles is well known. Experts told &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-why-crash-radar/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; in 2018&lt;/a&gt; that the likely cause is that these systems are programmed to mostly ignore stationary objects, otherwise they might react to all sorts of items on the side of roads, from signs to buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hi0z06"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s report notes that both Tesla and Volvo’s driving assist manuals warn drivers about this problem. As Tesla’s says: “Traffic-Aware Cruise Control cannot detect all objects and may not brake/decelerate for stationary vehicles, especially in situations when you are driving over 50 mph (80 km/h) and a vehicle you are following moves out of your driving path and a stationary vehicle or object is in front of you instead.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5wpVO"&gt;The NHTSA has stepped up its scrutiny of Tesla in recent months as the company’s Autopilot software has been the focus of an increasing number of crashes. Many industry experts have criticized Tesla for its marketing of the software, which often suggests that human oversight of the vehicle is optional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vq5cGV"&gt;In April, senators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397826/tesla-autopilot-investigation-blumenthal-markey-nhtsa-ntsb"&gt;urged the NHTSA&lt;/a&gt; to take “corrective actions” against Tesla and prevent misuse of its driving-assist software, and in June the agency &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557135/nhtsa-autonomous-adas-crash-rule-response-tesla"&gt;issued new rules&lt;/a&gt; requiring companies like Tesla and Alphabet’s Waymo to report all incidents involving such systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tether controversy, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gc8w3lHpkx8ttY49az-3lczlXik=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730489/acastro_210809_4689_tethercoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How stable are stablecoins?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L9tyJa"&gt;What if a digital currency wipeout could injure — or even destroy — the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem? Lately, there’s been a focus on stablecoins, the quiet &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/latest-hack-shows-power-of-stablecoins-in-decentralized-finance"&gt;power players&lt;/a&gt; of the cryptocurrency space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3MHUa"&gt;Questions about stablecoins, particularly one called Tether, have been knocking around in  financial circles for months: are they as stable as they ought to be? A vocal group of people — including &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-fixated-tether-cryptocurrency"&gt;the likes of Jim Cramer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nouriel/status/1333485054589345793"&gt;Nouriel Roubini&lt;/a&gt;, podcasters &lt;a href="https://cryptocriticscorner.com/2021/05/25/episode-1-tether-a-stable-discussion/"&gt;Bennett Tomlin and Cas Piancey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bitfinexed.medium.com"&gt;pseudonymous blogger Bitfinex’ed&lt;/a&gt; — have raised questions about Tether as a possible systemic risk to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. On August 9th, Tether put out an &lt;a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf"&gt;attestation about its reserves&lt;/a&gt;, a way of reassuring users that the most popular stablecoin is, well, stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Va3zUm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some Tether critics fear that its &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; use is to keep the price of Bitcoin high&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylye56"&gt;The attestation seems unlikely to reassure Tether’s most vocal critics, some of whom fear that its &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; use is to keep the price of Bitcoin high. The company has also been investigated by the New York attorney general for claims around its backing and settled with the NYAG earlier this year. As part of the settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state, the capital of the US financial world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CvU3g"&gt;Fears around stablecoins aren’t just limited to Tether. After months of hemming and hawing from regulators, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;has now clearly asked&lt;/a&gt; for more authority to regulate cryptocurrency. “We have a role as a nation to protect those investors against fraud.” Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, met with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/risks-of-crypto-stablecoins-attract-attention-of-yellen-fed-and-sec-11626537601?mod=article_inline"&gt;discuss stablecoins specifically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXeQkM"&gt;Right now, there’s no standardized way for stablecoins to disclose the assets that back them. It seems like an obvious target for regulators, but there’s also a way to do an end run around the needs for stablecoins at all. In fact, the way to get rid of stablecoins might just be… the dollar but digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gH8Q5V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a stablecoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YS5IoP"&gt;These digital currencies, which are pegged to other assets such as the US dollar or the Euro, are primarily used as payment mechanisms. Stablecoins’ name reflects the idea that the peg makes them less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, which can vary widely in value. Typically, when someone sets up a stablecoin, there’s a reserve for the assets, which are held as collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb010p"&gt;Some stablecoins are centralized, as well. With cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, if you’re hacked and lose money, well, sorry, you’re fucked. This isn’t the case for some stablecoins; when &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/hackers-steal-600-million-in-likely-largest-defi-crypto-theft"&gt;$600 million was stolen from PolyNetwork&lt;/a&gt;, Tether simply froze the $33 million of its tokens that were included in the heist. That rendered those funds useless to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UaQ0w0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tether is already in contact with the project that suffered the breach.&lt;br&gt;Process: project engages discussions with law enforcement + Tether. Tether validate the freeze and programs reissuance of funds.&lt;br&gt;Happened in the past with Kucoin hack and others.&lt;/p&gt;— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1425199265832476676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qy51h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do people use stablecoins for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8bE0ui"&gt;Payments, says Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers. The real competitors for stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) are things like Venmo and PayPal. Most of the time, the fees they charge for transactions are relatively low, &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=267119122101064078121082011082016077034092086004057035102127030103105107076070111087038017120036122008044070111011107011004103009046056035086108127122007023044076099107065093123103028093120117001000099086116006087001069087110113121007004127&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;Mizrach found&lt;/a&gt;; Tether’s fees are usually less than a dollar, while out-of-network ATM fees are about $3.08. (About 1 percent of transactions have fees higher than $25, though.) The same is true of USDC, another stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxGtL4"&gt;They’re also used as a place to store value when investors exit cryptocurrency trades, says Richard Li, CEO of 4K, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rolexes-in-defi-nft-marketplace-4k-raises-3m-to-combine-nfts-and-luxury-goods"&gt;an NFT marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine an investor — we’ll call him Mars Vulrich — wants to lock in some profit he made in Bitcoin. Now, our friend Mars can exit the trade back into US dollars and send that to his bank account, but it’ll take a couple of days. Some of that delay is that Mars has to comply with anti-money laundering laws to exit cryptocurrency back into the US dollar. During that time, if Mars sees a cool opportunity to get into another cryptocurrency investment, he won’t be able to reach that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7p9vnT"&gt;Now, he could instead exit his Bitcoin trade into a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. The relatively quick transaction would mean that his funds would be available to go into another investment right away. If Mars is trying to do rapid trading, he might choose to do this instead of moving back and forth between the traditional banking system and cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8Z9eD"&gt;Stablecoins can also be used for margin trading. Our buddy Mars can borrow money from an exchange such as Kraken, which will use its own funds to help execute the trade. But Mars has to put up some collateral for the loan, and stablecoins can be useful for that. Margin trading is risky — it can lead to very big losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mC6hlE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems like something that would interest government regulators, like the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6wMOjp"&gt;It is! SEC chairman Gary Gensler has suggested that stablecoins might actually fall under the SEC’s authority, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03"&gt;in remarks at the Aspen Security Forum&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, he said that stablecoins “also may be securities and investment companies. To the extent they are, we will apply the full investor protections of the Investment Company Act and the other federal securities laws to these products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w3PCvT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, but that hasn’t happened yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2jpUxi"&gt;Nope. Cryptocurrency regulation is kind of a hot topic right now, though, and Gensler used to teach courses on cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/biden-sec-pick-gary-gensler-fintech-regulation-and-blockchain"&gt;during his last gig at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SCjcMC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might the SEC want to get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AcH3k"&gt;Well, stablecoins are huge. The most popular one, Tether, launched in 2014 and is pegged to the dollar. It’s got a market capitalization of more than $60 billion. USDT tokens are involved in half of worldwide Bitcoin trades. And there have been questions about whether movements in Tether have created price manipulation in Bitcoin. &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=182125067086113009120127114015002097041005024009051078099101087029008103065122077006019036021056062013003068066118118092094026104012021061022090010115073108020090100008060035078093120101020122095117024098081092112126085086023022120121100087087112024118&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;One academic study&lt;/a&gt; found that a particular player on the Bitfinex exchange uses newly printed Tether to purchase Bitcoin when Bitcoin prices fall, to support Bitcoin’s price. Apparently, this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LDUXdB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t Tether get into trouble recently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dXS6P9"&gt;Why don’t we just go through a quick history? If you want a less abridged version, journalist Amy Castor has &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/"&gt;put together an exhaustive timeline&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/entertainment/for-better-or-worse-cryptocurrency-depends-on-tether-mens-journal/"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Men’s Journal&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; also gives you some of the history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rschC1"&gt;The biggest question right now — which has been in play for a moment — is what’s backing Tether. In 2014, it was originally called Realcoin, and the idea was that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-23780"&gt;backed by the US dollar on a one-to-one basis&lt;/a&gt;. For some time, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190219054619/https://tether.to/"&gt;the website read&lt;/a&gt;: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4MePo"&gt;In February 2019, this text changed to: “Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpuGA4"&gt;If “affiliated entities” raised your eyebrows, well, you’re not alone. See, in 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/realcoin-relaunches-tether-avoid-altcoin-association"&gt;Tether also announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464"&gt;the leak of the Paradise Papers&lt;/a&gt; established that the same people control both Bitfinex and Tether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyzIJo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tether declined to comment on why money moves between Bitfinex accounts and Tether accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nxs602"&gt;“Tether and Bitfinex are two different businesses and groups with two different objectives,” a Tether spokesperson told me when I asked about the relationship between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEv8k5"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company"&gt;New York state Attorney General Letitia James said&lt;/a&gt;, “Our investigation has determined that the operators of the ‘Bitfinex’ trading platform, who also control the ‘tether’ virtual currency, have engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million dollars of co-mingled [sic] client and corporate funds.” Tether’s lawyer admitted that Tether &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents"&gt;was only 74 percent backed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRHKgH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyway&lt;/em&gt;, Tether settled the case with New York state. &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf"&gt;In the settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;, the office of the attorney general found that Tether had &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;reserves to back the stablecoins in circulation for periods of time. On November 1st, 2018, it published a “verification” of its cash reserve at Deltec Bank &amp;amp; Trust Ltd. of the Bahamas, saying Tether was fully backed by cash. The very next day, though, that money began moving from Tether’s accounts to Bitfinex’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZviYl"&gt;Tether declined to comment on why money moves between Bitfinex accounts and Tether accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnaHnX"&gt;The settlement agreement, by the way, bars Tether from doing business with anyone in New York. Bitfinex and Tether did not admit wrongdoing but paid an $18 million fine; Tether must also provide quarterly reports on its reserves for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MGkxhg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, wow. So, Tether said it was backed, and the New York attorney general found that wasn’t true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MnGKPQ"&gt;Yep. &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal"&gt;Here’s how Attorney General James put it&lt;/a&gt;: “Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE2gru"&gt;Meanwhile, on August 9th, Tether tweeted “Tether has always been fully backed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7vfJGO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tether has always been fully backed and the assurance opinion made available today confirms it once again, and puts Tether ahead of the industry on transparency.&lt;a href="https://t.co/2CLZTLXNjb"&gt;https://t.co/2CLZTLXNjb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tether (@Tether_to) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1424703057926008834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLC1Ym"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yikes. Has Tether provided that quarterly report it promised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hpw6bu"&gt;Mmmmmmm, well, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt"&gt;the first move was pie charts&lt;/a&gt;! As of March 31st, about 76 percent of Tether was backed by cash and cash equivalents, including unspecified commercial paper, which is a kind of short-term debt issued by companies. The “cash and cash equivalents” are composed of 4 percent cash; most of the rest of it is commercial paper, which represents about half of Tether’s collateral, or &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a"&gt;about $30 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVZgiO"&gt;The recent attestation is &lt;a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf"&gt;more detailed&lt;/a&gt;. According to it, about half of the $62.8 billion in assets are held in commercial paper and certificates of deposit. A quarter of the assets are in Treasury bills, a significant increase from the last report — which may reassure some people, since T-bills have a reputation &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/types-investments/bonds/types-of-bonds/us-treasury-securities"&gt;as very safe assets&lt;/a&gt;. According to the accounting firm Moore Cayman, Tether has more money in its reserves than is required for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tZg4jP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a normal report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zm52U"&gt;We don’t know whose commercial paper Tether is holding, and that’s a little weird. I asked the company directly and the spokesperson’s written response was, “We are a tech company and we closely guard our counter-party relationships. At this time, we do not disclose the make-up of our commercial paper holdings.” That is… unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BoP7Uq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are the most transparent stablecoin issuer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5R0kBR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-22/private-equity-firm-got-rich-making-private-equity-firms-rich"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Matt Levine&lt;/a&gt; made a helpful comparison: &lt;a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-prime-money-market-fund-morgan-4812a2702#/portfolio"&gt;this is what JP Morgan discloses on one of its money market funds&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a lot more detailed than what we got from Tether. You can see the issuer, the specific identification code, how much money is invested, and the market value, among other things, for each holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2lEYz"&gt;There’s another stablecoin of comparison, and it’s USDC, which is also pegged to the dollar. It’s the second-largest stablecoin, actually! Anyway, USDC’s parent company, Circle, is attempting a SPAC. So we got an attestation &lt;a href="https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf"&gt;to its assets&lt;/a&gt;: 61 percent in cash and cash equivalents and 9 percent commercial paper. But USDC has its own issues; Coinbase had been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/coinbase-drops-promise-of-token-s-cash-backing-that-wasn-t-true"&gt;promising that there was $1 in a bank account backing each token&lt;/a&gt;. The attestation showed that wasn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Rz1r"&gt;Of the top 10 stablecoins, the &lt;a href="https://www.gemini.com/dollar"&gt;most transparent is Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, says Mizrach. It’s completely backed by dollars in FDIC-insured accounts. “That’s the model of transparency,” he says. Tether, naturally, would disagree. “We are the most transparent stablecoin issuer,” the spokesperson told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5DisUd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Tether’s still worth a dollar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dn7V4o"&gt;More or less, yeah. Most people who own Tether bought it from someone else, and they’re probably not going to try to redeem it — they’re just going to sell it, instead. There could, theoretically, be a run on Tether, though, like if the economy suddenly tanks or there’s another, more damaging government investigation or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="il0Tdy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there another investigation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pIt8AV"&gt;Yeah, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about bank fraud, with possible criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAdjQ6"&gt;This investigation doesn’t particularly worry Alan Konevsky, the chief legal officer of tZERO, a security token trading platform. “This was a company that was trying to figure out how to get off the ground in a fairly hostile financial services climate where they couldn’t even open a bank account,” he says. “A lot of crypto companies have had difficulty trying to open bank accounts.” Some of the problems Tether has experienced may be due to regulatory uncertainty, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQQg6Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone tried just asking Tether what’s up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1ohYi2"&gt;Actually, yes. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa had CTO Paolo Ardoino (who is also the CTO of Bitfinex) and general counsel Stuart Hoegner (who is also the general counsel of Bitfinex) on for a bizarre half-hour interview during which almost nothing was actually said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="apfkKi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBEqyiO35cQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ZoS6"&gt;This is worth watching in full if you’re curious, but the highlights are: Tether won’t say more about their commercial paper (due to nonexistent “privacy” concerns), won’t deny the commercial paper is Chinese, and say they’ve never denied a customer who wanted a redemption. The market trusts Tether, Ardoino says, because it’s popular. “We think the market has spoken,” he said. “We believe the market has voted with its feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JlmX2"&gt;Also, “we are working toward getting financial audits,” Hoegner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nsEPo2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t the CEO show for this interview?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KIbEh7"&gt;Here’s what Ardoino had to say about it: “So, our CEO [Jan Ludovicus van der Velde], and our CFO &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da3060c-8e1a-439f-a1d7-a6a4688ad6ca"&gt;Giancarlo [Devasini]&lt;/a&gt; are two great businessmen. They are working as hard as they can, they are super hard workers. They are really deeply involved with our businesses and they handle day to day operations, and they also are extremely available to our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFqwqu"&gt;Van der Velde and Devasini are also &lt;a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/profiles/bitfinex-leadership-jl-van-der-velde/"&gt;the CEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/profiles/bitfinex-leadership-giancarlo-devasini/"&gt;the CFO of Bitfinex&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R2xvE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you ask Tether about any of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="myYiJi"&gt;I did, and I didn’t get any further than Bosa. “At this time, we do not disclose the make-up of our commercial paper holdings,” Tether’s spokesperson said. I also asked if the commercial paper was Chinese. Tether declined to comment on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BsxQHa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if it makes other people nervous and Tether goes to zero?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V2BItF"&gt;To be honest, I don’t know. But a lot of other stablecoins have failed! For instance, of all the stablecoins created in 2015, 80 percent failed, according to Mizrach’s research. And 25 percent of those created in 2018 also failed. That makes the failure rate of stablecoins comparable to other digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4smAcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I took a flyer and lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="coUvKW"&gt;So let’s say that Tether holders start getting cold feet. A bunch of people decide to redeem their tokens. Our friend Mars Vulrich is among them. Now, per &lt;a href="https://tether.to/legal/"&gt;Tether’s terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, he might not get his money back right away — or he might find himself holding some of the mysterious commercial paper Tether says it’s backed by instead of US dollars. Now Mars has previously sued tech companies that have mistreated him, but Tether’s terms of service say that they can’t be held liable. And, as the TOS clearly spells out, Tether’s tokens aren’t “subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nArtap"&gt;We may have gotten a preview of what could happen with Tether in a run on a different stablecoin in June. The Iron Titanium token, an algorithmic stablecoin that was partially collateralized, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-17/mark-cuban-defi-iron-finance-crashed-100?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;fell from $60 to near zero&lt;/a&gt; in the space of a day. Mark Cuban lost his investment, telling &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, “The investment wasn’t so big that I felt the need to have to dot every I and cross every T. I took a flyer and lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t35Eb"&gt;According to Tether, there’s no need to worry. “Tether has never refused a redemption to a customer — and stress-testing of Tether is not hypothetical,” a Tether spokesperson said. “In March of 2020, bitcoin dropped by half in just a couple of days. Just two months ago, we had one of the worst days in bitcoin’s history, with prices falling by 30 percent in a few days in May. During those events, the Tether peg remained solid, all redemptions were honored, and the price across exchanges remained stable. Tether has been stress-tested multiple times and passed with flying colors each and every time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8VoGO"&gt;Tether declined to comment on the in-kind redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DT3HAx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. So how much risk is there from Tether to other cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5xyum"&gt;“Tether, being the largest, would jeopardize all but the most transparent of stablecoins,” Mizrach says. Gemini would likely benefit from a failure of Tether, though, and USDC could, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yShDSE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Tether went to zero, I’m sure there would be panic in the markets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NK0eYR"&gt;Tether is often used as a parking place for high-frequency traders, Mizrach says. It’s also used for leveraged cryptocurrency trading, Li points out. That means if Tether loses its peg, it can also tank Bitcoin and Ethereum. (Tether is involved in more Bitcoin transactions than the US dollar is.) “It can be construed as part of a systemic risk,” Li says. “But I think the risk is overblown relative to what most people think.” In his opinion, the real risks are people being out of jobs, and then unable to pay their mortgages — as well as the risks of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Cw9a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2021/02/JPM_Bitcoin_Report.pdf"&gt;A report from JP Morgan&lt;/a&gt; in February pointed out that USDT does a lot of the same things in the cryptocurrency world that banks do in traditional finance, but without the same supervision and without deposit insurance. So if people were unwilling or unable to use Tether tokens, “the most likely result would be a severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market,” which could lead to everyone trying to sell at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz8kVo"&gt;On the other hand, Konevsky tells me that he doesn’t think it would be as catastrophic as others fear. “It would be painful,” he says. “But I don’t think it will collapse crypto or stablecoins.” There are other available alternatives to Tether, he points out. Li agrees. “If Tether went to zero, I’m sure there would be panic in the markets,” he says. “But it’s probably not going to be an utter collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RN7vXW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there broader consequences for finance outside of the cryptocurrency realm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ri8gpy"&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/fund-asset-managers/stablecoins-could-pose-new-short-term-credit-market-risks-01-07-2021"&gt;according to Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Big Three credits rating agencies. Let’s say there’s a run on Tether tokens, and Tether has to suddenly sell its commercial paper. That “could affect the stability of short-term credit markets if it occurred during a period of wider selling pressure in the CP market,” especially if other sell-offs were happening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwChZz"&gt;The other thing Fitch points out is that during a period of financial stress, Tether may not be stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8OSvj"&gt;It’s not just Fitch worried about the broader consequences to the financial system. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Boston Federal Reserve president Eric Rosengren &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/risks-of-crypto-stablecoins-attract-attention-of-yellen-fed-and-sec-11626537601?mod=e2tw"&gt;have also expressed concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pYROOa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… what, uh, happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7T61do"&gt;Well, there’s a possibility that regulation of cryptocurrency changes — certainly the rumblings from the Treasury Secretary and the head of the SEC suggest that regulatory changes are coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pscxta"&gt;But one way to make Tether unnecessary is to create a digital dollar, and some US lawmakers seem to be warming to the idea, including &lt;a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/at-hearing-warren-delivers-remarks-on-digital-currency"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; (D-MA). (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-creates-its-own-digital-currency-a-first-for-major-economy-11617634118"&gt;China’s doing something like this already&lt;/a&gt;.) A digital dollar would drive out all of the dollar-pegged stablecoins, because that would mean zero counterparty risk, Mizrach says. “That’s the biggest risk to Tether,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T2yIa"&gt;Tether, naturally, disagrees: “We think it’s positive that governments are taking inspiration from private stablecoins, and especially Tether, as the most innovative, liquid, trusted, and popular stablecoin. We believe there’s room in the space for both CBDCs [central bank digital currencies, such as the digital dollar] and private stablecoins like Tether.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HPFWLF"&gt;Li views central bank digital currencies as inevitable. “I just hope they bring a level of transparency,” he says. He also wants lower fees on transactions. “It’s ridiculous that it’s 2021 and we still pay 2.9 percent fees to process transactions in the traditional world. It’s robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;
