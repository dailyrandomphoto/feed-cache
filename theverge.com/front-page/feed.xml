    <title>Ample raises $160 million on the promise of battery swapping</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ample&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ivyaMO"&gt;Battery swapping has long been a dream solution for the infrastructure problem standing in the way of wide electric vehicle adoption. Tesla famously tried but then abandoned the idea &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/9/8754667/tesla-elon-musk-battery-swap-fail"&gt;half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. But now a startup called Ample has raised $160 million to try to make it work — first for commercial vehicles, then maybe passenger cars and SUVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KngrIN"&gt;Given the approach Ample founders John de Souza and Khaled Hassounah are taking, they’ll need every one of those dollars, and then some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MevwRN"&gt;The goal with Ample is to convince automakers to make versions of their electric vehicles that have a sort of adapter plate instead of a full battery pack, while everything else stays the same. Then Ample plugs a bunch of battery modules into that adapter. The modules can then be easily swapped at automated battery swap stations, allowing for a much faster “fill-up” that saves time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWWQKV"&gt;Ample then turns around and provides these vehicles (and the battery swap infrastructure) to fleets that want to go electric. The reduced charging time, plus less burdensome on-site infrastructure — one swap station versus a number of high-capacity chargers — are among the selling points. Uber is already &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/03/ample-opens-5-ev-battery-swapping-stations-for-bay-area-uber-drivers.html"&gt;using a few Ample stations in the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; and supports a handful of vehicles like the Nissan Leaf and Kia Niro EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ITsrsp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery swapping has been tried in the US before, but no one has nailed the execution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtR8eV"&gt;What’s more, Ample is also going out and sourcing the cells that go in the modular packs, meaning it has to elbow its way into an extremely competitive market for batteries at a time when the world’s biggest automakers are literally throwing billions of dollars at trying to bring more battery capacity online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPehHI"&gt;de Souza and Hassounah aren’t coming at this cold, though. They’ve been building up Ample for years now, and some of its original investors — including Moore Strategic Ventures, which is run by &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/12/peter-nygard-louis-bacon-legal-battle-bahamas#:~:text=January%202016-,The%20Billionaire%20Battle%20in%20the%20Bahamas,each%20man's%20paradise%20into%20hell"&gt;hedge fund king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21319273/fisker-inc-karma-automotive-fundraising-public-evs-tesla-nikola"&gt;Fisker Inc. backer&lt;/a&gt; Louis Bacon, as well as Shell Ventures — are contributing to this series C funding round. Ample has brought on some new outside investors, too, like the venture arm of Singapore’s public transportation operator, as well as PTT, the major state-owned gas and oil company in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsu2Nm"&gt;And while battery swapping may still seem unfamiliar and possibly unfeasible in the US, it’s taking off in China, where startups like Nio have inspired the government there to &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/china-ev-swappable-battery-standards-approved/"&gt;basically start demanding a national standard&lt;/a&gt;. With billions of dollars headed toward charging infrastructure as part of the Biden administration’s push to clean up transportation emissions, as well as a flurry of investments and mergers happening in the electric vehicle space, there may be no better time for Ample to take its shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KSZO7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xa8THZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start with the funding because that’s the news. It seems like you’re bringing along some people who had already invested in the company, which I would imagine made a private round something that you would want to pursue and maybe perhaps a little easier than going another route. But obviously there is a large menu of options for funding these days for companies in the electric vehicle space, the automotive space in general, etc. What made you decide to go down this route that you’re about to announce? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcFCy4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza:&lt;/strong&gt; I think the highest level of the question is do [we] want to stay private or do [we want to be] going public. I think for us at this point ... there’s a lot to get done in terms of what we want to do in terms of bringing electric vehicles to to market, and we didn’t want any distraction from that. It’s a time where we’re focused on scaling and growing, and we are fortunate in that there are a lot of investors that see that and are willing to go through and work with us on it. So we decided for now staying a private company made a lot of sense, it allows us to keep the focus on exactly what we’re going to do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNQ9DQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see that there are some familiar names involved in this round. Did you find any resistance to raising this much money in the private market? Or was the conversation easy enough? Do you feel like investors are sort of more up to speed now than they have been in the last couple of years as far as some of this technology goes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntAZPx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s an opportunity to raise significantly more money. I think we chose an amount together with our investors that made sense. I think, if we wanted to go and raise more there’s an opportunity to raise more in the market. So I think investors definitely see the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fo7bM1"&gt;If you look back a few years, initially it was sort of, “Will electric cars ever happen?” or, “Is it electric, is it hydrogen?” I think that game has played out where now [people] see it’s electric. The question then became: “Is electric going to happen in the next 10 years?” That has gone. And so I think right now, it’s real. People see the tremendous momentum towards it. And they look at the different problems ... there’s a bunch of people trying to solve the vehicle problem, you know, all OEMs are, but there aren’t many people that have a really good solution for the infrastructure, so I think that helped us. We have a solution that solves a problem and can be profitable. And so it was easy to go back in to find investors that saw it, understand it, and want to invest in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Aau8Bv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is not [investors] coming and getting the dog and pony show”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLPo5W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;This round is kind of led by existing investors who’ve already been supporting Ample for a while, plus external investors. So external validation [shows] more and more people can understand and see the value of what you’re creating. But for us it was a very positive thing that our existing investors really saw the business grow and get what it is, to double down, and kind of say, “Okay, we want it scaled.” For us, this was the ultimate signal that this is not [investors] coming and getting the dog and pony show, going “Oh, this is great” — they actually understand it very, very deeply, and have been there for years, and just working with us to go to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8JWsA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/03/from-the-ashes-of-nearly-a-billion-dollars-ample-resurrects-better-places-battery-swapping-business-model/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;somewhat long history to this idea&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and I’m interested in what it feels like to try to build up this company now, when there is a much different set of circumstances like more money in the space and wider adoption of EVs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z84k82"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I think when you’re talking about technologies fundamentally changing the way we do things, they more often than not are second and third attempts, right? So Google was not the first search engine, Tesla was not the first electric car. So to a great degree, very often it’s less about kind of coming up with an idea that is completely new and no one has ever thought through, because most likely, if no one ever thought about it, it probably has no merit, right? John has a slide which shows a car from 1944 that’s being battery swapped, so the idea of moving energy, physically, has a lot of merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB7J1a"&gt;I think where the innovation comes in understanding not how do you create an idea from scratch, but just the hard work of figuring out, well, how do you adjust the way you think about that idea so that it becomes viable, so that it becomes inexpensive, easy to deploy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2LMIW"&gt;I think innovation comes more in that form. I mean we had to kind of fundamentally change one core aspect to it which is this idea of making it modular, because if you shift your mentality and say “Okay, it’s not one big bulk battery I’m going to move, I’m going to break it into smaller pieces,” a lot of things become a lot easier. But it requires a lot of innovation on the technology side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ppWVd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google was not the first search engine, Tesla was not the first electric car”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="708obv"&gt;Other than that, generally it’s just a lot of thinking on how do you make this practical economically viable, easy to deploy. And that’s where a lot of the innovation came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LYplf3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;There are lots people that said “let’s make the OEM standardize,” which sounds great and you’re just pushing all the work on to the OEMs. We said, well, let’s not ask them to standardize, let’s do all the work ourselves. And as Khaled mentioned, modularity helped us solve it. But we said we’ll do the heavy lifting. The solution isn’t to say well the OEM should just all standardize their solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IiO2Vv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One thing I want to ask you before we get into how things work, is that as you were raising this money, China has pushed really hard on this idea as well, and they are in some ways pursuing a sort of sweeping battery swap standard that may come to bear over there. Did that make it easier for you guys to raise money, and did that change your thinking technologically about how you might want to approach it, seeing what those companies were doing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf23CL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;I think in the US, we don’t look enough as to what’s happening around the world. So, I think a lot of people are surprised that there is a lot of battery swapping going on in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wei4z0"&gt;I think what is even more telling is that China has 16 times the number of fast chargers as the US — why are they doing battery swapping? And that I think is when people realize, “Hm, there must be something that’s not working with these fast chargers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQjnFp"&gt;So I think that really helped in terms of, they did invest a lot in charging, and now they’re doing this ... It’s an opportunity for us to learn from what they’ve gone through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEuvDh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;But one thing we have to be careful with is also making the assumption that we’re just taking technology from China and applying it to the West, because we have been working on this long before we even knew China was doing battery swapping. We’ve been at this for eight years. I think what China’s kind of pushing hard for it does [help], at least from a conceptual standpoint, it gets people familiar with the idea of, “even though China has built 16 times as many fast chargers as the US, they still kind of shifted, and there’s a good reason why that’s the case.” So it just makes kind of the overall argument a lot easier to sell. I think people pay a bit more attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8h1KJ"&gt;But in a way, battery swapping China-style — where the government forces every large automaker to go ahead and introduce a battery-swapping solution — doesn’t work in our environment, our market, and the way we do business and the way we do policy. So we need a different approach that can create an infrastructure that can be used by multiple automakers without them having to go and become a fully vertically integrated provider. And [in China] there’s less considerations for labor costs, and you can just staff factories with people all day long and assume that you’re going to make it economically viable because the government will subsidize you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG0jVT"&gt;We had to kind of home grow our own way of doing things that’s different that works within our environment. But I think the fundamental idea of moving energy physically is a lot cheaper, faster, easier to scale, [and] is the core idea here and I think it’s just maybe the commonality between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIuHfr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’re talking as the government here is still trying to put the final touches on a somewhat relatively big infrastructure deal, and that’s obviously a big focus of this administration. The awareness China brings to the idea of battery swapping is maybe advantageous to you. Establishing those differences between how they’re doing it and how you want to do it is important. Is there a political component to this, too? Does it help that China is working on this idea in the sense that you can say, “Hey, we need this too?” knowing how the reflection of what they’re doing versus what we’re doing is important to the policymakers in this country?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ykGIX7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have to do things because they make sense, not because China’s doing them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iu01fu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;It does, I just don’t want to overemphasize that. We have to do things because they make sense, not because China’s doing them, because otherwise you end up with the wrong policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MIW2N"&gt;So, in a way we just have to think practically on how we get there, and we’d much rather kind of focus on that and say, “Listen, China China China” ... and then that’s how you split people because you’re not making a solid, reasonable argument that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GWKVP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the technological side, you’ve both talked a little bit about this idea of keeping things modular trying to make it work for the OEMs. Can you walk me through a little bit more detail about what goes into that approach and why an OEM would want to embrace this idea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff1WqD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;Our approach with the OEMs is to give them an easy way to embrace this technology, and we said, we don’t want them to change the car, we don’t want them to have to change what they do. So the way we work with them is they continue to offer their fixed-battery [vehicles]. But for the solutions where swapping makes sense, they can offer this as an alternative without requiring them to go through and change the vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaHHNy"&gt;So it allows them from a business perspective to say, for the people that can use charging, the people who charge overnight at home, or whatever the situation is, we’ll continue to offer a solution. But for all these other [customers] where infrastructure is the limiting factor, here’s a partnership we have that allows us very easily to go through and solve both — allow them to move to electric and solve the infrastructure at the same time. We don’t view OEMs as our customers. Fleets are our customers and we partner with the OEMs to deliver a complete solution of infrastructure and vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eioqJr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building one battery pack that’s tightly integrated into the car can allow automakers to get the best optimization; they run the software that controls the pack, integrate it physically in the layout, knowing every centimeter matters when we’re talking about energy density. But say they embrace this idea and they want to serve some fleet customers with this modular battery pack idea. What are some of the tradeoffs they have to make in this sort of end product of this car that is powered by your modular pack, knowing that it’s got to be more difficult to reach the same kinds of vertical integration optimizations they can get from doing it themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Rznok"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;So that’s not what we’re going to do. We’re not going to the OEMs and giving them a battery and saying “even though you optimized this other battery to have the right shape, to have the right software interface etc, you should do something else.” We’re actually doing the opposite, which is we build our technology in a way where we adapt to how they decide to build the car — and that’s true for all ten car models we integrate with. We’re actually already working on two, hopefully soon three, more car models as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="L1Fyr1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they still build the car the same way.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SdmAt9"&gt;At the end of the day when you build an electric car you build a vehicle, and you build a battery. The battery has a certain envelope it can work within, and certain attachment points at which you attach to the chassis to provide the structural rigidity needed. And then you have a simple electrical and software interface. It’s really very basic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o02lzW"&gt;So we build what we call an adapter plate — it’s a bit more than that, this is a disservice — but we build kind of a structure that is identical to [the automaker’s] battery. It has the same software interface, has an electrical interface, attaches at exactly the same point, and provides the same level of security that you expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44BdM"&gt;Once that’s installed in the car, we can swap the modules out of it... we can always get to within 10 percent — sometimes 10 percent lower, sometimes 10 percent higher — in capacity, but our interface with the vehicle is exactly the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JognF3"&gt;If you look at traditional battery swapping, typically you went to the OEM and say we need you to build a different car, or modify the chassis of an existing car so that the battery can be taken in and out. In this case, no. We’re saying there’s a fixed device that stays in the car, it works exactly the same way, but it gives us an interface on the other end to take batteries in and out. We’ve standardized the batteries without forcing the OEMs to standardize the [pack], because they still build the car the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7NvEG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there is a capacity tradeoff at some level, you said 10 percent?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOXfyW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I mean sometimes we’re actually 10 percent higher. It depends. We’re not smarter engineers, we don’t want to claim we’re better than OEMs that are doing this. We’re better than some of them, but we’re not going to tell you whom. [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMppEN"&gt;We can figure out how to fit the maximum chemistry in the volume available, how to make sure it lives long, and how to monitor it. A lot of the innovation now is the chemistry. Really the LGs, Panasonics, CATLs of the world are the ones that are doing most of the innovations to get more energy into the form factor. The pack war was won five years ago when everybody became the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UW622p"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hcCbg1Nf-c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZIAQL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You talk about putting in all that work of designing the modular version of their battery pack — are you also turning around and sourcing the same kinds of materials, the same cells, or is the OEM going out and sourcing them, then providing them to you so you can fit them into these battery packs you have ready to swap? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KerKtl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;We are providing them with the complete battery pack. Think of everything that goes into building the battery pack, so we source the cells, we source everything to build it, and we deliver a fully made battery pack to the OEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jU1NT5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;One thing we typically don’t talk about because people are not interested in it, but it’s really very impactful, is that part of our innovation is this idea of abstracting the car from the chemistry. We use power electronics inside our modules that are inexpensive enough — that’s a lot of the innovation, how to make it inexpensive enough that it doesn’t impact the overall cost of the battery, but it allows us to abstract the car from the chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXE4n4"&gt;What that means... the first need was, how do you make one chemistry work with different cars. But then the flip advantage of that is how do you make one car work with multiple chemistries. So we’re able to kind of put different chemistries, even different state of health and state of charge and internal resistance, etc., in the same car, at the same time. In effect what that means is that over time, as you buy your car, we can keep introducing better chemistries that work with the existing vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FooiQX"&gt;So, in a way, we’re solving the problem for the OEM because right now they have to design the car around a specific chemistry and get stuck with it. And even if everybody thinks they have the best chemistry — that’s impossible. Even if someone else invents a better chemistry, the transition takes five to seven years and that’s what we’re seeing. So in a way, we’re making it more into like a three- to five-month process where if there’s a chemistry that is cheaper and safer, we just put it in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdHVQx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that in turn create any more work for the OEMs on maybe the software side of having to account for what chemistries go into the battery?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udL6YF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;That’s the beauty, it’s fully abstracted from them. So we do that on our end. We’re able to introduce to, to present the newer chemistry, even if it’s a voltage range, [it will be delivered] at the same voltage connecting into the vehicle. And that kind of simplification is what they should be easy for them because even for different chemistry we just adjust it and plug it in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2I1BP"&gt;We haven’t had to make a single line of software modification to any of the cars we integrated with even though we put varying chemistry in it in and a varying number of modules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o08s0J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you handle crash testing and safety implications of all of this, is that something that you guys are actually going and proving out, to make sure cars that use these modular battery packs are at the same standard of the sort of typical version?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVHzGe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;The good news is that you have standards that you have to go through and certifications that you have to do to demonstrate that [these batteries] are safe enough to go into the cars. So we have to do the same tests as anybody else putting batteries in cars. You go through, perform the tests, make sure you pass all those tests. In addition, as you work with every OEM, they may have additional tests that they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="iciZ4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there’s what we convince ourselves is true, and what reality is”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NU8LV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last thing I want to ask you about is the fleet side of this, the people who you’re saying are going to be your sort of initial customers. One of the things we hear all the time is that fleets (and the commercial space in general) makes the most sense for early adoption of electric vehicles because the way that they operate is very standardized and very easy to predict, and that sort of lessens the burden of charging. What’s your pitch to fleet customers to win them over to your approach versus installing five Level 2 chargers or a couple DC fast chargers and going that way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv2u3n"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m just gonna say one thing and then John you should comment on this. I’ll just say there’s what we convince ourselves is true, and what reality is. So let’s just start with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lJfdR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John de Souza: &lt;/strong&gt;I would say our best customers right now are people who’ve tried [battery swapping], because there’s a theoretical concept that people have, and they can convince themselves that charging will work, you will get everything lined up, people will show up to the depots and sync and you’ll get 95 percent utilization. And then they deploy the first 50 chargers and that’s usually when they’re about ready to cancel their EV program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUV5Y8"&gt;[There’s also] the shock of installing chargers. You expect it’s going to be $3-$5,000. But then, one [customer] was saying, in the end you have landscaping, all this stuff that you’re digging up. And if people are going to be [charging] a while they may need to be ADA compliant. You could be spending $3,000 plus per charger. So the cost is much higher than you think it’s going to be. So you get these installed, then you have to upgrade power, because the problem with chargers is that when everybody comes in and turns it on, you have this huge peak, so you need to upgrade and it costs a lot of money. And people are coming up with smart software, which is how do you drip [electricity] to different people.. which basically doesn’t work that well. And then the operational complexity is tremendous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG6wq0"&gt;So for us, our pitch is very simple. Do what you do right now. Switch over to electric, it will operationally stay the same, and we’ll charge you less than gas per mile, and we’ll take care of all the infrastructure. And that they understand. It’s very simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOmNE0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of some of those considerations, what is your approach for the end of life of these batteries? Do you have a certain threshold that they have to hit before you pull them out of the system. What’s the process after that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVx3lQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Khaled Hassounah: &lt;/strong&gt;It’s very straightforward. The batteries have a certain life cycle, it’s more or less predictable if you optimally charge them, they hit X number of cycles, and their capacity goes below [Y]. Being able to take them out is very straightforward because they’re literally being taken out every time you get energy into the into the vehicle so as they go out we take them out, they’re built in a way where we can immediately use them in second life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oK6f9w"&gt;Now one of the huge advantages is because we actively control how they’re charged, we really can get the maximum cycles out of them. If you have a battery that lasts 1000 cycles, versus one that you fast charge and can only do 700 cycles, the 1,000 cycle battery is 50 percent less expensive than the 700 cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTnmha"&gt;But one other thing is that when batteries are not being used, they do lose capacity so when you put a battery in a Tesla and you just park it for eight years, it is going to lose capacity. So there is kind of a time component. What we’re doing by moving batteries across vehicles is that we do get the maximum utilization out of every battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tqGbkQ"&gt;So over time that will lower the costs for everyone, but also increase the utilization of it before we have to go and completely recycle the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple debuts new trailer for The Morning Show’s second season ahead of September premiere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xxWYmCCT1UF6H19z7PA32qUMX8=/54x0:639x390/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764132/082321_Apple_The_Morning_Show_Trailer_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.medium.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ghQgHq"&gt;Apple has shared &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qZWPTsR-Wc"&gt;a new trailer for the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of its premier series for Apple TV Plus. The new 10-episode season debuts on September 17th, with new episodes hitting every Friday after. The show once again has an all-star cast, headed up by Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oXTNtN"&gt;Here’s Apple’s summary for the new season:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FWagLm"&gt;Picking up after the explosive events of season one, season two finds “The Morning Show” team emerging from the wreckage of Alex (Aniston) and Bradley’s (Witherspoon) actions, to a new UBA and a world in flux, where identity is everything and the chasm between who we present as and who we really are comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="X20sDO"&gt;Steve Carell also returns, and there are a number of new actors in the second season. One is Hasan Minhaj, who plays a new member of the eponymous “The Morning Show.” (&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported on Minhaj joining the cast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; following the cancellation of his &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/patriot-act-with-hasan-minhaj-canceled-at-netflix-4047572/"&gt;Netflix comedy / news talk show&lt;/a&gt;.) Will Arnett also makes a surprise appearance in the trailer — his casting wasn’t previously known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NdzczH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Morning Show explores abuses of power, but not really","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942618/the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus-review-jennifer-anniston-reese-witherspoon"},{"title":"Hasan Minhaj joins The Morning Show following Netflix’s cancellation of Patriot Act","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564529/hasan-minhaj-the-morning-show-apple-tv-plus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FEwwlK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says it has pay equity, but an informal employee survey suggests otherwise</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FSFK27wYEtHQCq6saovGyjrJ9qI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764124/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KXgRUx"&gt;An early analysis of the informal Apple pay equity survey shows a six percent wage gap between the salaries of men and women, according to software engineer Cher Scarlett. It’s similar to the gender wage gap in San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://hired.com/h/wage-inequality-report/2021/"&gt;which hovers around five percent&lt;/a&gt;, but disappointing for a company that claims people of all genders “earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgWsrH"&gt;The results are not scientific — employees opted into the survey and only 2,000 people responded (out of the &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2020/ar/_10-K-2020-(As-Filed).pdf"&gt;147,000 employees&lt;/a&gt; Apple estimated in 2020)  — but they point to why some employees are suspicious of the company’s claim that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12371204/apple-diversity-report-pay-gap-hiring-equal-pay"&gt;it fixed its pay equity problem&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UOHxCk"&gt;“We know pay equity was a problem in the past and Apple did something to fix it, but we’re having this conversation again because we’re seeing gaps in certain areas of the company and we want to know what Apple will do to prevent it from happening year-over-year,” Scarlett says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWuHQm"&gt;A small group of Apple employees, including Scarlett and members of the data analysis organization, will present the results to Apple’s people team this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nVXR64"&gt;Scarlett also says she found that there were far fewer women, non-binary, and non-white people in senior positions at the company — or in technical roles, which are typically among the highest paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bdfPUh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Honestly, without seeing the data team analyze the salaries, the most disturbing thing I noticed about this data is  the disparity between the gender demographics between white and non-white respondents. Out of nearly 2,000 people... it's alarming. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idvfVhQDD3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idvfVhQDD3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426434491069861895?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nfoiAx"&gt;“These charts suggest that white men have much more opportunities to advance within the company, and are more likely to be working in technical roles than less represented demographics,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1426664223053008896"&gt;she wrote on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwQIhH"&gt;Scarlett knows the survey isn’t conclusive. “We’re not trying to draw definitive conclusions, we’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none,” she explains. “What we actually want is for Apple to do a third-party investigation into salary data, or an audit that we have insight into.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fq1Uf1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was granted access to the survey data, which offers evidence of a salary gap among the respondents. We analyzed the survey data by isolating the approximately 1,400 technical roles, then grouping them by job level, gender, and race&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;We then found the median salaries for the job level as a whole, as well as the race and gender breakdowns within that job level. We went with the median value to smooth out any skewing that could come from outliers (which can easily crop up in user-provided data). The approach did not take into account things like college degrees or years of experience. We chose not to look at the non-technical respondents, as there were only around 520. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BNxksb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re trying to get some insight because we’ve had none”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBIA0M"&gt;Scarlett pushed back on the idea that there weren’t enough non-technical responses to merit analysis, noting that it might be harder for those employees to find out about the survey in the first place. “It’s easy to fall into the idea that the sample size is small so it should be set aside,” she says. “But the fact is I don’t work in retail and the places where I post mostly go to people in the software organization. So retail and support responses come in organically.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwz51J"&gt;Among the survey respondents in the data given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women, while the median pay for white employees in mid-level technical roles was 5.06 percent higher than that of non-white employees. This sample was 944 white men out of 1,408 total respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHg50D"&gt;The median number of stock grants (restricted stock units) for non-white workers in entry-level and mid-level technical roles was roughly 11 percent lower than the median number of RSUs for white workers among survey respondents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRmIgu"&gt;Higher levels of the engineering organization show a partial reversal in this trend. The median pay for women in principal engineering roles is 1.2 percent higher than the median pay of men among survey respondents — but Scarlett is wary of the results. “Men in those high roles are less likely to respond to the survey because they’re the highest paid in the company, outside of leadership,” she says. There were far fewer respondents in this category than for mid-level technical roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LbZifW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The median pay for men in mid-level technical roles was 6.25 percent higher than the median pay of women&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37Qfl8"&gt;Scarlett started the survey after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;shut down previous attempts for employees to gather pay data&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t think anyone is going into this saying there for sure is a wage gap, whether that’s gender or race or disability,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a previous interview. “But it is concerning to everyone that every single time someone tries to create more transparency, Apple shuts it down.” The company reportedly told employees that the previous surveys contained personally identifiable information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoZjGr"&gt;One Apple employee who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said an Apple director discouraged employees from taking the survey during an all-hands meeting last week. “A lot of us had the same thought that what he was saying was not great, it felt antiquated,” the source said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iY72dN"&gt;In 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/27/technology/apple-shareholders-show-their-support-for-tim-cook.html"&gt;Tim Cook told shareholders&lt;/a&gt; that women at Apple made 99.6 cents on the dollar compared to men, and underrepresented minorities made 99.7 cents on the dollar compared to white employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpzfV5"&gt;The company later said it fixed the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWPMl0"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Apple spokesperson Rachel Tulley sent the company’s already public statement on pay equity: “Apple has a firm and long‑standing commitment to pay equity. Globally, employees of all genders earn the same when engaging in similar work with comparable experience and performance. In the United States, the same is true for employees of all races and ethnicities. We don’t ask for salary history during the recruiting process. Our recruiters base offers on Apple employees in similar roles. And every year, we examine the compensation employees receive and ensure that we maintain pay equity.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi made me excited about the Marvel Cinematic Universe again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Actor Simu Liu in a fighting pose." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xazLP4DwX3YbLvwTG22pgZieHQU=/884x0:3458x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69764072/BUS3520_cmp_lum_v0045.1069_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Simu Liu takes on a whole lot of bad guys on a bus. | Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I’m ready for Shang-Chi to meet Thor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ji3EwO"&gt;For two hours &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; is a charming, family-friendly action-adventure movie about learning to grow up, learning to grieve, and learning to flex ab muscles so the light hits them &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; right. Then, as every movie set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is wont to do, it reminds us it’s part of a large fabric and its characters are destined to join forces with the likes of Captain Marvel, Thor, and Doctor Strange. And instead of being exhausted, I was elated. This movie helped me overcome my MCU fatigue, and — unlike every other Marvel flick since the Snap — actually set out to tell a new story absent of the baggage of Iron Man and the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DINpa1"&gt;It helped that it’s just a really fun film, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHzmM2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; stars Simu Liu, who came to fame as the lovable, buff son in the Canadian sitcom &lt;em&gt;Kim’s Convenience&lt;/em&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, he’s again playing a charming guy with more abs than career drive. But after more than a decade of super capable Marvel superheroes, it’s refreshing to have a guy who’s content to just park cars and stay out all night drinking cheap booze and singing karaoke with his best friend. The best friend, in this case, is Katy, a completely normal woman with zero ties to the larger Marvel universe. Awkwafina minimizes the appropriative accent that brought her fame to make Katy a compelling human anchor for the otherworldly adventures the film takes its hero on. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tony Leung as Wenwu and Fala Chen as Jiang Li in a combative embrace." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrxEMkMPgpgFKGTBp6Zd-eGjiik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800295/WML3070_cmp_scn_v0011.1002_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;While &lt;/em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;em&gt; is a very Marvel movie, and thus pretty sexless, it cannot contain Tony Leung. He missed every Disney memo to smolder less.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dytTMO"&gt;Well, one of two anchors really. Tony Leung, one of the biggest stars to ever come out of Hong Kong, makes his American film debut in &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; as Shang’s father, Wenwu. Wenwu, besides being the titular character’s dad, is also the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; leader of the MCU’s Ten Rings, the terrorist organization that played a major role in &lt;em&gt;Iron Man 3&lt;/em&gt;. Leung is one of the greatest actors working today and immediately elevates what could have been a rote role. He’s suave and menacing as the ageless leader of a group of assassins who run a chunk of the world from the shadows, but he’s tragic and affecting as Shang’s distant dad who has spent more than a decade abandoning his children and mourning his wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVikGv"&gt;The grief these characters share is ultimately what &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is about. The two men, and Shang’s younger sister Xialing (played by a wonderfully droll Meng’er Zhang), were once harmed by the loss of Shang and Xialing’s mother and they spend the film trying to reckon with that grief more than a decade after her loss. It gives &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; a surprisingly effective emotional core, which is good because the plot is fairly thin beyond the familial drama. This isn’t &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; with intricately plotted reveals and Marvel-y twists. It’s a film about a dad and his kids learning to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Awkwafina as Katy, and Simu Liu as Shang, stare in open mouthed shock at something out of frame as Ronny Chieng as Jon Jon embraces them both while looking amused." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TgEIVwkoE443udEvQXp_pN7V8qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800302/SBT_15765_C.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Jasin Boland&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Katy and Shang getting ushered into a much more Marvel-y world.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k1b0Le"&gt;But, you know, it’s still Marvel, so all that learning to process grief happens in between the best action in a Marvel film since &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. This is director Destin Daniel Cretton’s first action film, and you would not believe it with how confidently he shoots this movie. He holds the camera steady so the fast-moving and fantastically choreographed fights are easy to see. It feels like you’re watching a Hong Kong action film from 1991 — in the best way possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gbCma"&gt;The only time the fights drag are when CGI enters the picture, and like &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22555587/black-widow-review-disney-plus-marvel"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, the CGI seems to get in the way, feeling goofy and looking silly after we just watched Shang-Chi battle ninjas across the sides of buildings. Marvel’s come to be emblematic of a kind of glossy modern action aesthetic that leans on cartoonish CGI when practical would have done it better, but &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is the first time I felt truly disappointed by its appearance instead of just a little annoyed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xialing, Shang, and Katy look at something awkwardly in the distance." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMNQxO1LlwvK9mbrT4L1t9qGPDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800322/SBT_24518_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Jasin Boland&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xialing, Shang, and Katy are just some kids trying to grieve and / or help their loved ones grieve while getting embroiled in interdimensional wars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ef87s3"&gt;Thankfully, the CGI only infects small chunks of the film, and while it does contribute to the worst of the Disney / Marvel excesses of the finale, it's used sparingly enough that you can make peace with it. The film has a great cast, anchored by some real heavyweight actors (Michelle Yeoh and Tony Leung act opposite each other for the first time since 1993’s &lt;em&gt;Butterfly and Sword&lt;/em&gt;), sharp action, and more heart than I’ve seen in years from something out of the MCU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqn2nD"&gt;Which brings me back to actually being excited about the MCU again. Shang and Katy feel like real, normal people (or as normal as a former child assassin and his bestie can be) thrust into a much larger world of gods and monsters and interdimensional wars. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is the first film of Phase 4 of the MCU to not feel like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22561250/black-widow-marvel-endgame-thor-age-of-ultron"&gt;a denouement for &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; And like &lt;em&gt;WandaVision and Loki&lt;/em&gt;, it cracks open a much, much larger world and gives us a glimpse of where the next big Avengers team-up could take place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WnBGUt"&gt;But where &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt; were about some of the most powerful characters in the Marvel universe, &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; is about a guy who can fight really well but would probably rather be doing some karaoke or earning enough to pay his rent. &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; establishes Shang as the heart of whatever this eventual new team will be and finally moves the Marvel Cinematic Universe out from the shadow of Avengers who have come and gone before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqZQPH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters only on September 3rd. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, it will not have a dual release on Disney Plus Premiere Access. That is a bummer because this film deserves to be seen and audiences should feel safe while watching it.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="8T76XI"&gt;After prodding Nike with a Lil Nas X collaboration for “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22374480/nike-mschf-lil-nas-x-unauthorized-satan-shoes-lawsuit-settled"&gt;Satan Shoes&lt;/a&gt;” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573466/mschf-dead-startup-toys-drop-price"&gt;memorializing iconic failed startups as toys&lt;/a&gt;, the internet collective MSCHF is aiming bigger and further out &lt;a href="https://mschfxfamousmouse.com/"&gt;with its next drop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2gOpCq2qlPvaYe6S7vwIgKemwGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800386/famous_mouse.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSCHF “Famous Mouse” token&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="slf48h"&gt;Mickey Mouse is set to enter the public domain in 2024, at which point MSCHF could make a Mickey Mouse artwork. Today, in 2021, we cannot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7LH5h"&gt;Instead, we are making and selling the idea of a MSCHF “Famous Mouse” artwork now, that will not exist–even as a design–until 2024. If you purchase this artwork, we give you a temporary token with a unique code that can be redeemed for the actual piece in 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dmWaCz"&gt;Instead of waiting a few more years for copyrights on works from 1923 to expire, MSCHF is taking a decidedly modern approach and selling the idea for its artwork now, tied to a token that buyers can redeem in 2024. The name is still copyrighted so for now this is just a “Famous Mouse,” find out more &lt;a href="https://mschfxfamousmouse.com/faq/"&gt;in the FAQ here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l6hQL"&gt;The tokens will ship in a “plastic slab case” with a sticker covering the code. Buyers are free to sell or trade their codes, and whoever has one can redeem it in 2024, assuming Mickey Mouse &lt;a href="https://blog.jipel.law.nyu.edu/2019/12/in-2024-mickey-mouse-will-finally-enter-the-public-domain-sort-of/"&gt;actually enters the public domain&lt;/a&gt;. As MSCHF points out, “It is entirely possible that Disney will lobby for changes to U.S. copyright law in order to further hoard their IP. After all, what is the law compared to the power of a U.S. corporation?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile is giving customers a free year of Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiC77TNwBUp-4F-OVSyfPk0hggo=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763688/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0n2u1d"&gt;T-Mobile has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Foffers%2Ft-mobile-apple-tv-on-us&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a new promotional perk&lt;/a&gt; for its customers: starting on August 25th, both new and existing subscribers to its Magenta and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;Magenta Max&lt;/a&gt; plans can get a year’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscription to Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGx288"&gt;The deal applies to virtually any of T-Mobile’s post-paid customers that it classifies as part of those plans, including its Magenta 55 Plus, Magenta Military, Magenta First Responders, Sprint Unlimited Plus, Sprint Premium, and T-Mobile for Business plans. Better yet, the deal isn’t just for newcomers to T-Mobile; it seems that anyone subscribing to those plans can get the free year of Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tew1Ky"&gt;Customers under T-Mobile’s Magenta, Magenta Max, and T-Mobile for Business can find the offer listed under their rate plan details on T-Mobile’s website or app to get the free year, while customers who are still under Sprint’s umbrella will have to go to T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-plus-deal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F23%2F22637797%2Ftmobile-free-apple-tv-plus-12-months-magenta-plans" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promotional site&lt;/a&gt; and apply the code 2021APPLETVP1 to get the offer. (Regular T-Mobile customers can do that, too, should they prefer.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nGr6x0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Watch ‘Foundation’ for free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKhcRS"&gt;T-Mobile also notes that the free 12 months on offer here will seemingly apply even if you’ve had a subscription or trial to Apple TV Plus before, meaning that customers can stack the deal with other free trials, like the three months of service that come with the purchase of a new Apple device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96944Y"&gt;The freebie also comes as T-Mobile is reckoning with its recent massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633853/tmobile-data-breach-imei-sim-fcc"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, which exposed data for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630446/t-mobile-47-million-data-breach-ssn-pin-pii?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;millions of its customers&lt;/a&gt;, including first and last names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver’s license / ID numbers, phone numbers, and IMEI / IMSI information for 7.8 million postpaid customers. Additionally, T-Mobile says that data on over 40 million “former or prospective customers” was compromised in the breach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6kuAz"&gt;And while it’s certainly a nice bonus for customers, it’s likely that a few months of &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;will not make up for having to deal with the ramifications of having that much personal data leaked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Richard Branson’s satellite launch firm, Virgin Orbit, to go public via SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spaceport Cornwall Opens Exhibition On Satellites At Newquay Airport" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CrAzwtZg39_mbQZwyLfON1EDCWQ=/0x0:5327x3551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763558/1333540386.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfvqEz"&gt;Richard Branson’s Virgin Orbit, a satellite-launching spinoff of the billionaire founder’s space tourism firm, is going public through a merger with a shell company, the firm announced on Monday. The company will be valued at $3.2 billion and includes an investment from Boeing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bulDnU"&gt;Virgin Orbit plans to merge with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; (also known as a SPAC), NextGen Acquisition Corp. II around the end of 2021. It will be listed on NASDAQ under the ticker “VORB.” The deal will bring Virgin Orbit $483 million in new capital — $383 million stored in NextGen and $100 million from another round of funding. Investors in that round include Boeing, Virgin said, but it’s unclear how much they pitched in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CLhaNb"&gt;The $483 million will help Virgin Orbit ramp up “rocket manufacturing to meet customer demand, and to fund growth in its space solutions business and Virgin Orbit’s ongoing product development initiatives,” the company said in a press release. “Our success in launch has driven the business forward, and now we expect this investment will enable us to build on our R&amp;amp;D efforts and our incredible team,” Virgin Orbit CEO Dan Hart said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-VIRGIN-ORBIT" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLCnJ3JtENB9XTvkGj_BBasx4YE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22691005/1230643749.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9c5Z2"&gt;That Virgin Orbit would go public has been sort of an open secret for months, mainly after &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-12/branson-targets-new-space-spac-to-take-virgin-orbit-public"&gt;reports emerged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.sky.com/story/branson-plots-3bn-spac-merger-to-launch-virgin-orbit-onto-stock-market-12330845"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that the company was shopping for a SPAC with which to merge to go public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCcTrP"&gt;Virgin Orbit, founded in 2017, launches a small rocket called LauncherOne from the underwing of a modified Boeing 747, named Cosmic Girl. It uses a so-called “air launch” method that the company touts as being more reliable and quicker for getting satellites to space than the more common methods of launching rockets vertically from the ground. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22221212/virgin-orbit-rocket-test-launch-satellites-nasa-branson"&gt;reached orbit for the first time&lt;/a&gt; in January and deployed ten satellites, and later launched its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557103/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-debut-commercial-mission-richard-branson"&gt;first commercial mission&lt;/a&gt; in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5eyNw"&gt;The launch industry has been racing to NASDAQ ever since Virgin Galactic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;Branson’s space tourism firm, went public in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Small launch firm Astra went public through a SPAC in June, becoming the first company of its kind to do so. Rocket Lab, another small launch company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;plans to do the same&lt;/a&gt; and begin trading on NASDAQ on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine gets full FDA approval  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vaccine Mandates For Kids Is Next Big Back-To-School Fight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/htBgOtKfd6Ox0dLJnnT04Ic-OHo=/0x0:5280x3520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763296/1234462203.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6zBmZ"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;granted full approval&lt;/a&gt; to the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, another landmark in the historic immunization campaign. The vaccine was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22158608/fda-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-authorized-emergency-use"&gt;available&lt;/a&gt; to people over the age of 12 in the United States under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt;. Now, it’s officially licensed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06KGpd"&gt;With full approval, Pfizer and BioNTech can directly market the shot to consumers. The vaccine will be marketed under the name Comirnaty to people over 16. It will still be available to people 12-15 years old under an emergency use authorization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSeH0j"&gt;“The FDA’s approval of this vaccine is a milestone as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic,” acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a statement. “While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XacCgw"&gt;The approval may push more companies and schools to mandate vaccinations. While it’s legal for them to require vaccinations under an emergency authorization, some have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/us/colleges-vaccinations-enrollment.html"&gt;been reluctant&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Public health officials hope that full approval may encourage more people to get vaccinated. “Today’s milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the U.S.,” Woodcock said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI86vD"&gt;The companies needed to provide six months of safety and efficacy data on their vaccine to the FDA in order to submit their application for what’s called a Biological License. The agency only asked companies to collect &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download"&gt;two months&lt;/a&gt; of data before applying for an emergency use authorization. The shortened timeline allowed the agency to sidestep some of the more lengthy regulatory steps and get vaccines to people quickly during the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgCShz"&gt;This approval is based on mountains of data, including a clinical trial that looked at 20,000 patients who received the vaccine, and 20,000 people who received a placebo. That trial found that the vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598151/pfizer-covid-vaccine-efficacy-drop-booster"&gt;91 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing symptomatic COVID after six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyzy9C"&gt;“Our scientific and medical experts conducted an incredibly thorough and thoughtful evaluation of this vaccine,” Peter Marks, director of FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said in a statement. As part of the evaluation, the agency reviewed hundreds of thousands of pages of data, conducted new analyses of the vaccines’ effectiveness, and inspected manufacturing facilities, Marks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Baol4h"&gt;FDA approval may help some people who were on the fence about getting vaccinated feel more comfortable taking the shot. One &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-may-2021/"&gt;May survey&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of unvaccinated adults would be more likely to get a COVID-19 vaccine that was fully approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0ccM0"&gt;Now that one COVID-19 vaccine has full approval, other pharmaceutical companies will not be able to ask the FDA for new emergency use authorizations. Emergency authorizations can only be issued for drugs or vaccines when there are no approved options available — now that the Pfizer / BioNTech shot is licensed, that’s no longer the case. If AstraZeneca, for example, wanted to make its shot available in the US, it would have to start with the longer formal approval process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bNExtg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxWquB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s QC35 II wireless headphones are $100 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bose QC35" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_W2a0myee91gszcuQyY_CIjmssE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69763269/bose1_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDaTXS"&gt;The Bose QuietComfort 35 Series II, often referred to in shorthand as the QC35 II, are just about the cheapest they’ve ever sold for today. &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fbose-quietcomfort-wireless-headphones-12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has new, black-colored units with a one-year Bose warranty for $195&lt;/a&gt;. According to pricing data from CamelCamelCamel, this is $5 cheaper than the previous best price on record. These aren’t the latest noise-canceling headphones to hit the market. They released in late 2017, and the reasons they’re still popular are because of their solid sound quality, comfort, a dedicated voice assistant button, and an effective noise cancellation effect. One thing you might not like about them, though, is that they recharge via a Micro USB port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3uzUI"&gt;A new set of Bose headphones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583264/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-qc45-fcc-filing-leak"&gt;appeared in an FCC filing recently&lt;/a&gt;, a possible hint that the QC45s might be releasing sooner than later. They’ll almost certainly be an improvement in many ways over the QC35 II, but they’ll likely be much pricier than today’s deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vLVp3v"&gt;Apple’s clear case for the iPhone XR is, frankly, a terrible value for the $40 or so that the company usually charges for it. So, if you have an iPhone XR and want a durable case with simple styling, I’m encouraging you to instead &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749902636215052284" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consider Best Buy’s deal&lt;/a&gt; on the case. It’s going for just $14, so you could even buy two of them, in case one should degrade over time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rY20hi"&gt;It wasn’t too long ago when finding a webcam selling for a reasonable rate was out of the question. If you want a basic webcam that offers 720p resolution at 30 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-C505-Webcam-720p-Long-Range/dp/B08BNJPVXG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s C505 is selling for its lowest price today at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, costing $40 instead of $55. Given these specs, don’t expect remarkable fidelity, but it should be good enough if you just need an affordable webcam for jumping into some face-to-face meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9n9NRd"&gt;Last week, we featured a $100 off deal on Apple’s latest iPad Mini from 2019. Your chances of finding that deal increased over the weekend, as Best Buy started honoring this deal. You can get $100 off each model, whether it’s limited to Wi-Fi or you want an LTE-enabled model. The price starts at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903282026194249" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 for the 64GB Wi-Fi model&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749903296052984453" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$430 for the 64GB LTE version&lt;/a&gt;. Does this recent price drop mean that a new iPad Mini is around the corner? I wish that we knew!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Kindle-Paperwhite-Waterproof-Storage/dp/B07CXG6C9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The ad-supported Kindle Paperwhite e-reader with 8GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; is still $80 at Amazon, down from $130.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Wifi-System-Router-Replacement/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A three-pack of Google Wifi mesh Wi-Fi routers&lt;/a&gt; is just $150 at Amazon. With the cost for one router set to $91, getting three of them for $150 is a great value.&lt;/li&gt;
