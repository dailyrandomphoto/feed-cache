    <title>Space billionaires get skewered in the first promo for Jon Stewart’s Apple TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPL-gUZEuLW95reYAtW0on8g7Ks=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608088/Screen_Shot_2021_07_20_at_12.04.07_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jon Stewart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uUsHO"&gt;Jon Stewart shared a video promoting his upcoming Apple TV Plus show, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Jon Stewart&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s an odd one: the three-minute and ten-second clip shared on Twitter is a comedy skit roasting the recent billionaire &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585470/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-amazon-customers"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/17/22573791/space-tourism-industry-bezos-branson-musk-billionaire-phase"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, starring Jason Alexander as Jeff Bezos and a mop as Richard Branson. There are also a lot of dick jokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zL6eff"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162"&gt;Here’s the clip, if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CTAh9R"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sorry for the aborted launch!!! I’m a bad twitterer. &lt;br&gt;Enjoy this small step for man! &lt;a href="https://t.co/6gBHHJLByQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6gBHHJLByQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jon Stewart (@jonstewart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonstewart/status/1417557259886940162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1LxoS"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how this might relate to the show itself, which is set to debut in September. Apple announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371914/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-release-launch-date-fall"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; that the show would be “a multiple season, one-hour, single-issue series” and each season will have a “companion podcast” released alongside it — it didn’t mention anything about comedy sketches lampooning space billionaires. It’s also still unclear how many episodes will be included in a season or how many seasons the show will have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHi2xI"&gt;I have to say that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793"&gt;this is pretty hilarious, though&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qYIUAr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We filmed the hat weeks ago   &lt;a href="https://t.co/OsJ8iIkTdY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OsJ8iIkTdY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chelsea Devantez (@chelseadevantez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chelseadevantez/status/1417565284773281793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCaMn"&gt;Apple first revealed that the show was in the works &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537071/jon-stewart-apple-tv-plus-show-announced"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. Stewart’s iconic show &lt;em&gt;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart &lt;/em&gt;ended in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s new PS5 Digital Edition for Japan is mysteriously two-thirds of a pound lighter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMVlII49MS7TqW6XFP1V4370QGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69608041/vpavic_4278_20201030_0281.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4gp40"&gt;Sony sleuths just stumbled onto a surprise in Japan: the company has quietly kicked out a new version of the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition that’s listed as 300 grams lighter than the original (&lt;a href="https://www.psu.com/news/new-ps5-digital-edition-model-revision-coming-weighs-300-grams-lighter/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;PSU&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That’s fully two-thirds of a pound, bringing the mammoth console down from &lt;em&gt;well over&lt;/em&gt; the eight-pound mark to just slightly under it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHOMxm"&gt;How, you might ask? Well, that’s the question! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fULeQi"&gt;According to Sony’s official manual (&lt;a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/pdf/CFI-1100B-3.0_2.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) and quick start guide (&lt;a href="https://manuals.playstation.net/document/pdf/CFI-1100B-3.0_1.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;), as spotted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PS5sokuhouInfo/status/1417462433526939648"&gt;by PS5sokuhouInfo on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; differences between the new CFI-1100B and the original CFI-1000B are that change in weight and a new thumbscrew for the PS5’s vertical stand so you don’t need a screwdriver or coin to get it set. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PSuCm5V72NdHc1VAF__TBJtD8p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22729048/ps5_thumbscrew_japan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new textured thumbscrew.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hPrBW1"&gt;It’s not like the console lost any girth: Sony’s documentation shows it has the same exact dimensions. So what could have possibly changed? The system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170536/ifixit-teardown-playstation-5-dualsense-controller-gamepad"&gt;does have a beefy internal power supply, giant heatsink, and lots of shielding&lt;/a&gt;, so those come to mind, but we’ll have to wait for a new teardown to be sure. Or perhaps it’s just a typo. For context, the full-fat PS5 with the disc drive weighs just under 10 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uduTDs"&gt;The new version is already listed at Japanese retailers and will go on sale at the end of July, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PS5sokuhouInfo/status/1417458950333554689"&gt;according to PS5sokuhouInfo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venmo drops the global social feed that could make your payments visible to strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hwkyG1J8cYMMMsMMsiwjJbX4FvI=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607871/Updated_Venmo_home_screen_LQ.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Venmo app without the global social feed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Venmo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sWgx5h"&gt;Venmo announced it's &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/07-20-2021-The-Venmo-App-You-Know-and-Love-Now-Has-a-New-Look-and-Feel"&gt;removing its global social feed&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, the payment app’s notorious feature that allows strangers to potentially view payments you make and receive on Venmo (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/venmo-makes-it-so-users-can-t-see-payments-between-random-people"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goovqP"&gt;Now Venmo’s social elements will be limited to your actual friends on the app in the “friends feed” without you having to toggle any features in the app. The company buried the change &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/07-20-2021-The-Venmo-App-You-Know-and-Love-Now-Has-a-New-Look-and-Feel"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing an update to the Venmo app. Venmo writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ouQoGz"&gt;As part of our ongoing efforts to continually evolve the Venmo platform, while staying true to the heart of the Venmo experience, we are removing the global feed, and the friends feed is now the only social feed that will appear in the app. The Venmo community has grown to more than 70 million customers, so this change allows customers to connect and share meaningful moments and experiences with the people who matter most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rDA5MZ"&gt;Until recently, Venmo also offered users no control over who saw their friends list within the app, which is potentially incriminating in an entirely separate way from seeing the content of a transaction. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/we-found-joe-bidens-secret-venmo"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;discovered President Biden’s Venmo account and the accounts of people in his inner circle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436847/venmo-contact-friends-list-not-private-president-joe-biden"&gt;via the friends list&lt;/a&gt;, the company added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22459163/venmo-privacy-controls-friends-list-joe-biden"&gt;additional privacy controls&lt;/a&gt; for the visibility of your Venmo contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaHfpqm9scsELr6qYrRMv4307wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22728863/Goods_and_services_payments_LQ.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Venmo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How the new “goods or service” payment toggle appears in Venmo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HcveCS"&gt;Along with the major change to what’s actually visible in the Venmo app, the company is also giving users the ability to mark if they’re making a payment for a “goods or service” and receive the benefits of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvenmo.com%2Flegal%2Fus-user-agreement%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F20%2F22585467%2Fvenmo-removes-global-social-feed-private-payments" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Venmo’s Purchase Protection program&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone accepting payment for goods or a service is charged a small fee to receive their money (1.9 percent of the transaction plus 10 cents), but Venmo says it may cover the buyer and seller for refunds, which brings Venmo more in line with the Purchase Protection &lt;a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/paypal-safety-and-security"&gt;its parent company PayPal offers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjoeZ2"&gt;Venmo says the updated app experience should be available in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dg6hG6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PSA for US Congresspeople: here’s how to set your Venmo feed to private ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/8/22374698/venmo-feed-matt-gaetz-public"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XDwAKz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden to nominate Google critic Jonathan Kanter to lead DOJ antitrust division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEmFKRHAzYJ07-WJ70h5XcqCmtw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607723/51268580333_f21dc6b731_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Adam Schultz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9vkBx"&gt;President Joe Biden will nominate Jonathan Kanter, an ardent Google critic and competition lawyer, to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-20/biden-to-name-google-foe-jonathan-kanter-as-doj-antitrust-chief?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dl798T"&gt;Kanter has a long history of representing companies in competition cases against Google, and he opened his own law firm last year. If confirmed by the Senate, Kanter would take the helm on a slate of cases against big tech companies led by the Justice Department, including a monopoly lawsuit filed against Google last October. The case accuses the search giant of creating an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i4Mrop"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Jonathan Kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vrf2N9"&gt;“Jonathan Kanter is a distinguished antitrust lawyer with over 20 years of experience,” the White House said in a press release Tuesday. “Throughout his career, Kanter has also been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttABz4"&gt;The Justice Department is also currently engaged in a sweeping competition investigation into Apple and the requirements it places on developers in its App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL2xWc"&gt;Kanter is just the latest Biden nomination marking a significant step forward in antitrust enforcement, especially in the tech industry. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Biden nominated Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt;, a tech antitrust pioneer and author of the widely cited “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox” legal paper, to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Tim Wu, another progressive antitrust champion, currently sits on the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0XreO"&gt;Kanter aligns closely with Khan and Wu. But unlike Khan, who needs a majority of votes at the FTC to enforce antitrust law, Kanter would be able to file lawsuits to stop mergers on his own as deputy attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QdafM"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;Biden signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; designed to promote competition with a strong focus on technology companies. The order included a new mandate requiring “greater scrutiny of mergers, especially by dominant internet platforms, with a particular attention to the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by ‘free’ products, and the effect on user privacy.” The order also called on the Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade Commission to issue new rulings promoting policy goals like the “right to repair” and net neutrality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lightyear finds a manufacturer to build its solar-powered EV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0jiLp98zukIIcL1JDY1ho_f_9Uc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607681/5fca01a6fbc77c595eeafb11_lightyear_death_valley.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oqn0S3"&gt;Dutch startup Lightyear &lt;a href="https://lightyear.one/press-releases/lightyear-selects-valmet-automotive-for-the-production-of-lightyear-one"&gt;has found a manufacturing partner&lt;/a&gt; to build its solar-powered electric car, the Lightyear One. Finnish contract manufacturer Valmet Automotive signed a letter of intent with the startup this week, and the two companies plan to start building prototypes together in early 2022, with an eye on midyear for the beginning of production of nearly 1,000 vehicles. A second vehicle meant for mass production is yet to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEJdxt"&gt;Lightyear was founded in 2016 by a team of engineers who had competed together in the World Solar Challenge, a race held every few years in the Australian outback that’s meant to advance the idea of solar-powered cars. The startup showed off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744078/lightyear-one-solar-powered-electric-car-release-date-price-range-features"&gt;first prototype of the Lightyear One in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a sharp-looking sedan, and Lightyear made some big promises at the time, including 725 kilometers (450 miles) of range. Lightyear also said the car would be extremely efficient and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;be able to generate about 12km (7.5 miles) &lt;em&gt;per hour &lt;/em&gt;with the solar cells embedded in the roof — effectively making it possible for owners to go long stretches of time without plugging it in. All of this will come at a price: the limited-run Lightyear One costs around $165,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnCHN0"&gt;Lightyear said Monday that it spent more than a year trying to find the right manufacturing partner before coming to an agreement with Valmet. The Finnish contract manufacturer has been around since the late 1960s and has built cars for Saab, Mercedes-Benz, and even Porsche. It’s currently co-owned by a large Finnish private equity group and the government of Finland (each with a 39 percent stake) and is part-owned by leading Chinese battery company CATL (which has a 22 percent stake). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgpfSq"&gt;Using solar cells to power an electric vehicle is a tall task; there’s just such a great disparity between the amount of energy that the best cells can capture from the sun’s rays and what’s needed to make a two-ton hunk of metal move at speed. But Lightyear isn’t the only team trying to make it happen. Aptera — a California startup that crashed in the aftermath of the Great Recession — was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22358355/aptera-ev-three-wheeled-doe-atvm-loan-program"&gt;recently resurrected&lt;/a&gt; and has been raising money while building prototypes of its own funky three-wheeled design. German startup Sono Motors is also working on &lt;a href="https://sonomotors.com/en/sion/"&gt;a solar-powered electric car&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09SrSR"&gt;Lightyear has raised around $100 million to date, though roughly &lt;a href="https://lightyear.one/articles/lightyear-successfully-closes-48m-funding-round"&gt;three-quarters&lt;/a&gt; of that funding has &lt;a href="https://lightyear.one/press-releases/lightyear-welcomes-dutch-multinational-shv-as-partner-and-investor"&gt;come in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s been building a big head of steam. In April, it &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/22/exclusive-bridgestone-partners-with-lightyear-for-custom-tires-on-lightyear-one-sev/"&gt;racked up a partnership with Japanese tire giant Bridgestone&lt;/a&gt;, and in early July, it revealed results from a long-range test that show the company &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/07/lightyear-one-prototype-delivers-441-miles-of-range-on-a-single-charge-in-latest-track-test/"&gt;could actually meet its ambitious range and solar generation goals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is bundling three months of HBO Max with the Chromecast for $64.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An image of the Google Chromecast, the best streaming stick of 2021 for most people, resting on a soundbar." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S6G2G_RCehiWIg57RpaDHMuf8NE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607665/DSCF2097_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iCB92B"&gt;Google has started &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US"&gt;selling a new bundle&lt;/a&gt; that gives you some premium entertainment to go along with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; streaming gadget. For $64.99, you’ll get both the Chromecast with Google TV and three months of HBO Max. The device usually retails for $49.99, and HBO Max’s ad-free tier &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=GoogleChromecast072021"&gt;costs $14.99 per month&lt;/a&gt;, so you’re basically getting two months of the service for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pIEho"&gt;As usual with this sort of thing, the deal is only available for new subscribers of HBO Max; existing customers are out of luck. Google is offering the bundle beginning today, and it’ll be available for the rest of the year. The company is limiting each customer / Google account to three devices, but it’s not like you can stack the HBO Max offer, so there’s not much reason to buy more than one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efVqTU"&gt;Google also continues to offer a Chromecast and Netflix bundle for $84.99. That combo includes six months of Netflix’s standard two-screen streaming plan. Oddly, it seems like the HBO Max deal is only available with the white Chromecast, but the Netflix bundle can be had with the pink and blue colors as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xW9ErH"&gt;The 2020 Chromecast remains our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;favorite overall streaming device&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to Google TV’s excellent recommendations and robust app support. And the company continues to refine that experience; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318824/google-tv-kid-profiles-announced-features-parental-controls"&gt;adding kids profiles&lt;/a&gt; a few months ago, this week, Google added the option to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584901/google-tv-continue-watching-hide-titles-in-progress"&gt;manually clear content&lt;/a&gt; from the “continue watching” row, which can sometimes keep displaying shows and movies you’ve already finished. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Female Olympians needed to train longer to beat Tokyo’s heat</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team Great Britain trains ahead of the Tokyo Olympics.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Harriet Lander / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gw6gVs"&gt;The Olympians streaming into Tokyo this week are about to be faced with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583913/summer-olympics-danger-zone-extreme-heat-tokyo"&gt;hottest games&lt;/a&gt; in decades, with temperatures around 90 degrees Fahrenheit and suffocating humidity. Many athletes and sports physiologists have had their eye on the summer temperatures in Japan for years and have been planning to help athletes acclimate to the heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fPMjL"&gt;In the weeks leading up to the games, female Olympians may have had to spend more time preparing for the heat than their male counterparts. Some early studies show that it can take twice as long for female athletes to adjust than male athletes. The information is limited, though, because until only a few years ago, most of the research on how to prepare to compete in hot environments was only done on male athletes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQONWf"&gt;“There are going to be more considerations to make for female athletes, and there are definitely some differences in how they adapt,” says Jessica Mee, who studies performance in extreme environments at the University of Worcester in the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rWfjdT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There are definitely some differences in how they adapt”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w9n93D"&gt;Athletes can use a number of strategies to acclimate to the heat, like training in layers of clothing, doing extra training sessions to keep the body temperature elevated, or spending time in heat chambers or saunas after exercising. &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2019.1666624"&gt;The process&lt;/a&gt; lets the body disperse heat more easily, decreases core temperature and resting heart rate, and increases sweat rate — all of which let someone perform at a high level even in hot temperatures. The changes can last &lt;a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23328940.2019.1666624"&gt;around a week&lt;/a&gt; after someone leaves a hot environment before starting to drop back to normal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9lFbK"&gt;Most research outlining this process, though, was done on male athletes. “For so long the narrative has been about young, healthy men,” says Oliver Gibson, who studies physiological responses to heat at Brunel University London. “We’re only now just getting down to the details of sex differences in heat responses.” It’s a common problem in sports medicine: female athletes are &lt;a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/blog/scicurious/women-sports-are-often-underrepresented-science"&gt;highly underrepresented&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/health/training-performance/where-are-women-sports-science-research/"&gt;in sports science research&lt;/a&gt;, so most of our understanding about how the body responds to exercise and under various conditions is based on male athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITmrGk"&gt;Over the past few years, a few studies by Gibson, Mee, and others helped sketch an initial understanding of the differences between how male and female athletes respond to the heat. They both seem to react to being in hot environments in similar ways, Mee says. The differences crop up around preparation to be in hot environments. &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.12417"&gt;Her research&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00539/full#h8"&gt;other studies&lt;/a&gt; show that it takes longer for female athletes to adapt to being in the heat than it does male athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGPD4V"&gt;In general, male athletes could adjust in around five days of heat acclimation, but it took female athletes 10 days, Mee’s &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.12417"&gt;study found&lt;/a&gt;. “For females, it’s going to take more than this short-term five day approach that is usually seen as preferable because it’s less compromising on their training,” she says. “They have to make sure that they’re getting adequate time to implement these strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO50Ys"&gt;It’s not clear why it takes female athletes longer to acclimate, Gibson says. It may be that, because males tend to have more muscle mass (which heats up more quickly), they’re able to get their body to adapt to the heat more quickly. Larger male bodies might also store more heat, so they get to that point sooner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28TBNo"&gt;Gibson says he’s had conversations about heat acclimation for athletes with the English Institute of Sport, which supports British Olympians, over the past few years. That’s included conversations about the sex differences in heat acclimation. “From the outset, we’ve said that for female athletes, you need to consider this additional time burden,” he says. “It’s certainly something that I know that, within the UK at least, has been on the mind of those who are preparing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peFsO8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“From the outset, we’ve said that for female athletes, you need to consider this additional time burden”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JAN4V"&gt;The Great Britain women’s soccer team worked with the English Institute of Sport on its heat acclimation programs, which included spending 90 minutes a day on a stationary bike in a heated, humid tent for a week, &lt;em&gt;The Athletic&lt;/em&gt; reported. Other countries are implementing similar programs: the Canadian women’s eight rowing team &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/heat-training-athletes-1.6090826"&gt;trained in a heated sports dome&lt;/a&gt;, according to CBC, and United States athletes got custom acclimation programs from the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s senior sports physiologist Randy Wilber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOB6rZ"&gt;“Athletes who prepare effectively for heat and humidity can beat a lot of athletes who have more talent than they do but who have not prepared effectively for heat and humidity,” Wilber told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4LQnoq"&gt;Understanding the differences between how male and female athletes acclimate can help elite athletes preparing for the Olympics. But they also have implications outside of sports. Climate change is making the hottest days hotter around the world, and record-shattering heatwaves are occurring with steady frequency. Extreme heat is a dangerous health risk, and figuring out how to help people adapt to hot temperatures is an important public health issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46Mw7I"&gt;Heatwaves are a particular risk to people who work outside, like &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/07/19/heat-wave-workers-climate-change/"&gt;farmworkers&lt;/a&gt;. Male workers might adapt to the heat in a few days, but it could take female workers longer. Recommendations around how people should adjust to and protect themselves from the heat should be tailored to each individual, Gibson says. “If we’re saying that for four or five days you should reduce your activity and then you’ll be able to gradually return to activity levels before the heat wave, for females, it might be four or five days is insufficient,” he says. They might need more heat protection because their bodies may not adjust over the course of a few-day-long heatwave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eimsCr"&gt;Athletes tend to be the starting point for a lot of research on physiology because there’s a clear application for what they learn, Mee says. “There’s a drive and interest in getting additional marginal gains,” she says. They’re also often a healthy and robust group, and they can handle the type of stressors researchers need to put on the body to learn how it responds, Gibson says. Then, experts can take that information and see what might also apply to everyone else. “While what works for an athlete might not work directly for a member of the general public, we can learn some lessons there,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsNeqM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYbF6I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canada plans to start letting vaccinated US travelers back into the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trudeau Gets Leeway From Voters On Slower U.S. Border Reopening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0seGkOuO0HusF4hwIwCAbTIXKwI=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607338/1233137677.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="39lKlv"&gt;Starting on August 9th, Canada is planning on opening its borders to vaccinated Americans after the country &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185034/us-canada-border-closed-coronavirus-non-essential-traffic"&gt;stopped allowing nonessential travel&lt;/a&gt; in March 2020 (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/19/canada-us-border-open/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to the &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2021/07/easing-border-measures-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada---permitting-discretionary-travel-for-citizens-and-permanent-residents-of-th.html"&gt;Canadian government’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the new travel rules will apply to US citizens and permanent residents who are currently living in the country and who have been fully vaccinated with &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines.html"&gt;one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, as well as unvaccinated children who are traveling with a vaccinated guardian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcXldo"&gt;The announcement does say that the change will only happen if conditions in the country are still good — meaning that if Canada sees a spike in cases between now and August 9th, the border reopening may be reconsidered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3m4tDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It won’t be as easy as showing up to the border with your vaccine card and passport&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="He6OG5"&gt;It’s also clear that, while nonessential travel will be allowed, it won’t be as easy as showing up to the border or airport with your vaccine card and passport. The Public Health Agency of Canada says that travelers will have to fill out a questionnaire using the ArriveCAN app, and that they’ll have to have a “suitable quarantine plan” that they’re prepared to carry out if they don’t meet the requirements for quarantine exemption. &lt;a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/news/2021/07/easing-border-measures-for-fully-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada---permitting-discretionary-travel-for-citizens-and-permanent-residents-of-th.html"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; goes more into the exact requirements and criteria, along with other policy changes that will be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDbjUj"&gt;For Americans who have missed visiting their northern neighbors, it seems like trips may be a possibility again soon for those who have gotten the jab. But while preparation and planning were a very good idea for international travel before the pandemic, the additional requirements and documentation submissions make it essential for those who don’t want to be turned away at the border.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jeff Bezos appreciates your efforts to get Jeff Bezos to space</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9HQRA"&gt;After landing from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;his little jaunt to the edge of space&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos thanked the people who let him do it. “I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this,“ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahULmV"&gt;No, really, he said that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3f0KgN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;this is somehow a real quote&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jeff Bezos: "I want to thank every Amazon employee, and every Amazon customer, because you guys paid for all this ... thank you from the bottom of my heart very much."&lt;a href="https://t.co/5JREV6Uha7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5JREV6Uha7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Champion (@matthewchampion) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthewchampion/status/1417514573582716932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2KS83"&gt;Going to space had been a dream for Bezos since at least high school; his valedictory speech included discussion of creating permanent human colonies aboard space stations, according to Brad Stone’s &lt;em&gt;The Everything Store.&lt;/em&gt; His high school girlfriend is also quoted in the book: “The reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.” In some sense, Amazon was a means to an end for Bezos. Blue Origin, founded in 2002, was always the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFrWQg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The reason he’s earning so much money is to get to outer space.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V0jpRQ"&gt;Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 after leaving DE Shaw, an investment firm; Amazon initially operated out of his house. The store began by selling books, but over time expanded to, well, just about everything. The company’s first profit came in 2001, during the dot-com bust. He is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;one of the richest men&lt;/a&gt; — and sometimes &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; richest man — in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqnsrp"&gt;Bezos is known as an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-10-10/jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon-excerpt-from-the-everything-store-by-brad-stone#p2?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;especially abrasive leader&lt;/a&gt;, giving feedback such as “Are you lazy or incompetent?” “If I hear that idea again, I’m gonna have to kill myself,” and “Why are you wasting my life?” He was, by all accounts, particularly focused on the customer experience at Amazon, and hyper-competitive. When he stepped down as CEO earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264425/amazon-new-ceo-andy-jassy-replacement-jeff-bezos"&gt;Andy Jassy&lt;/a&gt; — formerly the head of Amazon Web Services — took over. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s Mobileye begins testing autonomous vehicles in New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--Iyixj3yVZeSi8IiZHXErYGrHs=/129x0:1520x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69607138/mobileye_av_nyc_intel_24.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fqi0bk"&gt;Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, is now testing its AVs in New York City — a difficult and rare move given the state’s restrictions around such testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRk8eE"&gt;The announcement was made by Amnon Shashua, president and CEO of the Intel-owned company, at an event in the city on Tuesday. Shashua said the company is currently testing two autonomous vehicles in New York City, but plans to increase that number to seven “in the next few months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ahW57"&gt;New York City has some of &lt;a href="https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2021/06/30/new-york-city-worst-traffic-in-the-country/"&gt;the most dangerous, congested, and poorly managed streets&lt;/a&gt; in the world. They are also chock-full of construction workers, pedestrians, bicyclists, and double- and sometimes even triple-parked cars. In theory, this would make it very difficult for an autonomous vehicle to navigate, given that AVs typically rely on good weather, clear signage, and less aggressive driving from other road users for safe operation. But Shashua said this was part of the challenge in deciding where to test Mobileye’s vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3p486Y"&gt;“I think for a human it’s very, very challenging to drive in New York City,” Shashua said, “not to mention for a robotic car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8k6r18"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think for a human it’s very, very challenging to drive in New York City”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XqMaTA"&gt;While other states have become hot beds for AV testing, New York has been a bit of a ghost town. Part of the reason could be the state’s strict rules, which include mandating that safety drivers keep their hands on the wheel at all times and requiring state police escort at all times to be paid for by the testing company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlFzwc"&gt;A spokesperson for Mobileye says the company has obtained a permit from the state to test its vehicles on public roads and is currently the only AV testing permit holder in the state. The spokesperson also said that police escorts were no longer required. (A spokesperson for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo deferred comment to the state’s Department of of Motor Vehicles, which did not immediately reply to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEoOvV"&gt;In 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16488330/gm-cruise-nyc-self-driving-car-test-cuomo"&gt;GM-backed Cruise announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to test its self-driving vehicles in lower Manhattan, but &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/gms-plan-to-test-autonomous-cars-in-new-york-city-seems-1828945330"&gt;those plans were scuttled&lt;/a&gt; with little explanation as to why. Boston-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20755163/new-york-city-self-driving-shuttle-service"&gt;Optimus Ride tested autonomous shuttles in Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt;, but only on private roads as part of the borough’s Navy Yard. Meanwhile, operators flocked to places with friendlier regulations (like Arizona) or ones that are more convenient to their headquarters (like California).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKb4N4"&gt;Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system relies on two subsystems, Shashua said: one that relies on 12 cameras and no other sensors, and another that includes lidar and radar, but no cameras. The company will combine the two subsystems later this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6LRuR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;The camera-only system&lt;/a&gt; will go into production as a Level 2 advanced driver assist system on Zeekr, which is a new electric vehicle brand from China’s Geely. This will allow Mobileye to gather more data from consumer-owned vehicles, which it will then use to bolster its fleet of autonomous cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5r3L9I"&gt;Mobileye’s system also includes two of the Israeli company’s latest EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ90MT"&gt;The company is testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities&lt;/a&gt; around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well. Earlier this year, Mobileye said it would launch a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023"&gt;full-scale, fully driverless delivery vehicle service&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
