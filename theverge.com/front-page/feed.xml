    <title>GM starts delivering electric Hummer pickup trucks to customers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwovvWKUymwYJ2RUb53obNlZlJE=/168x88:1112x717/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291570/gm_hummer_ev_pickup.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbmOLe"&gt;GM has officially started sending its Hummer EV Edition 1 pickup trucks out of the factory and into the driveways of customers, according to a &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-electric.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s website. Built on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium platform&lt;/a&gt;, the Hummer EV Edition 1 model comes with a hefty $110,295 price tag, along with up to 1,000 horsepower, 11,500 lb-ft of torque, and an estimated 329-mile range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBqIcF"&gt;Features unique to the vehicle include “CrabWalk,” a mode that enables the truck to drive diagonally at low speeds by pivoting the rear and front wheels at the same angle. Another feature increases the height of the truck’s suspension by six inches, potentially allowing the truck to clear large rocks or water when off-roading — in the fine print, &lt;a href="https://media.gmc.com/media/us/en/gmc/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/dec/1217-hummer.html"&gt;GM says&lt;/a&gt; that this feature won’t come with 2022 Edition 1 models, but it will be available via a free software update and will come standard in any models produced in 2023 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fjAB4vj24s9FA0UD1mKTuwAXrls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23111405/hummer_ev_rear_gm.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jeffrey Sauger for General Motors&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ff8kLd"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 also has a performance setting that lets you harness the electric propulsion system’s full power, which GM claims can send the vehicle from zero to 60 in about three seconds. It comes with Super Cruise as well, giving you a hands-free driving experience and enabling automatic lane changing on compatible roads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701086/cadillac-super-cruise-2022-escalade-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;Super Cruise was temporarily discontinued&lt;/a&gt; on the 2022 Cadillac Escalade due to the chip shortage, but it doesn’t appear that the Edition 1 is affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZmLeU"&gt;The Hummer EV Edition 1 model has since been sold out, but there are other trims still available for preorder. The Hummer EV 3X is set to become available in the fall of next year, and will cost $99,995. It will come with an estimated range of over 300 miles and three motors producing 830HP and up to 11,500 lb-ft of torque.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8atEq"&gt;Meanwhile, the 625HP Hummer EV 2X will cost $89,995, comes with two motors, and will be available in the spring of 2023. It will last an estimated 300 miles on a single charge, and will produce 7,400 lb-ft of torque. Finally, the cheapest of the bunch — the Hummer EV 2 — also has two motors and produces the same 625HP and 7,400 lb-ft of torque. GM plans to release it for $79,995 in the spring of 2024, with a range of over 250 miles on a full charge. You can view the full rundown of trims &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/pickup-trucks"&gt;on GM’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6JxLC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436401/gm-hummer-electric-reveal-date-picup-truck-crab-mode"&gt;The company initially revealed&lt;/a&gt; the electric Hummer pickup truck late last year. The first of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/insider/barrett-jackson-auction"&gt;auctioned off for $2.5 million during an auction in March&lt;/a&gt;, with all of the proceeds going towards the Tunnel to Towers Foundation, a charity that helps wounded veterans. GM also announced that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22839470/fedex-gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-ev600"&gt;started shipping out the BrightDrop EV600&lt;/a&gt; to FedEx, a commercial delivery vehicle that’s built on the Ultium platform as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save $10 on any game over $15 during Epic Games’ Winter Sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bmEZlu34gR5UOWY0_E119Gua6Ug=/0x23:1270x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291393/Screenshot_2021_12_17_152300.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now through January 6th, Epic Games is slashing prices on titles new and old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CabhAX"&gt;This weekend, you can be sure that much of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; staff will be adding to their pile of PC shame. &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/"&gt;The Epic Games Store has officially kicked off its annual Winter Sale&lt;/a&gt;, bringing sizable discounts on fresh titles like &lt;em&gt;Jurassic World Evolution 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;. What’s really cool though, is that Epic is discounting any title that’s more than $14.99 by an additional $10. And don’t sweat it too much if you’re having a tough time figuring out what to buy, as the sale will be running until January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NkWFK9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Still need a Christmas gift? We’ve rounded up a few digital options to consider","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22834542/digital-holiday-gift-ideas-last-minute-online-subscriptions-2021"},{"title":"Here are 65 last-minute gifts that will arrive in time for the holidays","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22840189/christmas-gifts-best-last-minute-tech-gaming-gadgets-shipping"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tax8IJ"&gt;Regularly $49.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B086PJKVVT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can currently grab&lt;/a&gt; the Logitech G305 Lightspeed in a variety of colors at Amazon for $29.99. This discount isn’t out of the ordinary, but it's pretty difficult to find a wireless gaming mouse with these specs for this price. In addition to a standard black or white model, the Logitech G305 is also available in purple, blue, green, or teal, making it easy to coordinate colors with the rest of your setup. Weighing just 99 grams and powered by a single AA battery, the G305 can reportedly last for up to 240 hours. It also pairs a 12K DPI sensor with six programmable buttons, allowing for excellent gaming performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DWZcGx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10821865"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bSGpzY"&gt;If you’re looking to ramp up your home theater system, Polk Audio’s MagniFi Max features a pair of wireless satellite speakers and a dedicated subwoofer that might do the trick. Typically $599.99, the 5.1 system is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Polk-Audio-Surround-Performance-Subwoofer/dp/B0753ZLK2H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgd5GhM3ND7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy to just shy of $500&lt;/a&gt;, one of its lowest prices to date. This 43-inch soundbar is a solid option for anyone with several consoles or other HDMI-compatible devices, thanks to its trio of HDMI ports and support for HDMI ARC. This model also features Bluetooth connectivity — as well as a 3.5mm port and an optical connection — along with a built-in Chromecast and support for Google Assistant, allowing you to pair it with other Google-compatible devices in your home and control it using voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FlNVaB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10936678"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezDyQe"&gt;Normally $149.99, Amazon is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YPC3BQC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the Razer Viper Ultimate and its RGB charging dock for just $92.97&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t quite the lowest price we’ve seen for this ambidextrous gaming mouse going for, but it’s still a solid deal if you’re in need of a wireless mouse. The Viper Ultimate comes equipped with a 20K DPI sensor and eight programmable buttons. It can also last up to 70 hours between charges and the charging dock is compatible with other wireless Razer mice, including the Basilisk Ultimate and DeathAdder V2 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MdUjcs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10456097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="aNkUYM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2YSbUI"&gt;All of Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 models are &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22447824%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/surface-pro-8/8qwcrtq8v8xg?rtc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently being discounted by as much as $200&lt;/a&gt; at the Microsoft Store. The base model comes equipped with an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, and while it would normally cost $1,099, it's currently discounted to just $899.99. This is a solid deal on what reviewer Monica Chin called “the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in years.” Just note that while all the current configurations of the Surface Pro 8 are discounted, some models are only receiving a price cut of $100 or $150. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KT2K4m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pqxtgK"&gt;The Corsair K60 RGB Pro is a keyboard with everything you need, and nothing you don’t. Normally, you’d expect to pay $89.99 for this solid bit of kit, but you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Key/dp/B08L61WLW7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently find it at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1221034/2092?subId1=VergeDailyDealPost121821&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fcorsair-k60-rgb-pro-gaming-keyboard-for-pc%2F-%2FA-80110499%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target for $69.99&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The K60 features per-key RGB lighting and linear switches but omits the dedicated volume and media controls often found on other Corsair models to help save space. Amazon’s $20 discount also currently applies to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Key/dp/B08N5DTKDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99 K60 RGB Pro SE&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a magnetic wrist rest and PBT double-shot keycaps to cut down on fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E3r1r1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10936897"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQSw2Y"&gt;More great deals happening now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

This cuts the regular MSRP in half and matches the lowest price we’ve seen on this eye-catching accessory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w9RamK"&gt;The PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;, easily one of the best action titles of the year, are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgewNhqnJpq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Best Buy for $22.99&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $40 off the typical list price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>WSJ’s deep dive into eating disorder rabbit holes on TikTok explains a sudden policy change</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-0XGlX8nQgHa0YYdID1OLGr4WA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70291285/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKFPaC"&gt;A troubling report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tiktok-inundates-teens-with-eating-disorder-videos-11639754848"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; digs into the personal experiences of young girls who were sent down rabbit holes of extreme weight loss challenges, purging techniques, and deadly diets through TikTok, contributing to the development of eating disorders, or making existing ones worse. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; did its own experiment to see how TikTok’s algorithm can potentially promote this kind of harmful content — its findings may explain TikTok’s sudden decision to alter the way its video recommendation system operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNn6ve"&gt;As detailed in the report, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; created over 100 accounts “that browsed the app with little human intervention,” 12 of which were bots registered to 13-year-olds that spent time on videos surrounding weight loss, alcohol, and gambling. A chart included in the report shows that as soon as one of the bots abruptly stopped watching gambling-related videos and began spending time on videos about weight loss instead, TikTok’s algorithm adjusted itself accordingly; it quickly increased the number of weight loss videos that the bot saw to account for this shift in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iR9cKJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“While this experiment does not reflect the experience most people have on TikTok, even one person having that experience is one too many”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLz4L5"&gt;By the end of its experiment, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;found that of the 255,000 videos that the bots watched in total, 32,700 of those contained a description or metadata that matched a list of hundreds of keywords pertaining to weight loss. 11,615 videos had text descriptions that matched keywords relevant to eating disorders, while 4,402 had a combination of keywords that indicated the normalization of eating disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fX0m49"&gt;A number of these videos were reportedly using different spellings for eating disorder-related keywords to avoid getting flagged by TikTok. After the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; alerted the platform to a sample of 2,960 eating disorder-related videos, 1,778 were removed — the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says it’s unclear whether it was taken down by TikTok or the creators themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krAGQE"&gt;Just one day before the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s report dropped, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations"&gt;TikTok announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s working on new ways to stop these dangerous rabbit holes from forming. This change also occurred just days after the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; says it contacted TikTok for a statement about its upcoming story, so it’s possible that TikTok preemptively rolled out the update before the report was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFuc4D"&gt;In its post, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839453/tiktok-for-you-recommendations-harmful-content-fyp"&gt;TikTok acknowledges&lt;/a&gt; that it isn’t always healthy to view certain kinds of content over and over again, including videos related to extreme dieting and fitness. It’s now working on a way to recognize whether its recommendation system is unintentionally serving up videos that may not break TikTok’s policies, but could be harmful if consumed excessively. The platform also says it’s testing a tool that will let users stop videos containing certain words or hashtags from showing up on their For You page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pzLmB"&gt;“While this experiment does not reflect the experience most people have on TikTok, even one person having that experience is one too many,” said TikTok spokesperson, Jamie Favazza, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We allow educational or recovery-oriented content because we understand it can help people see there’s hope, but content that promotes, normalizes, or glorifies disordered eating, is prohibited.” The spokesperson also pointed out that TikTok provides access to the National Eating Disorder Association Hotline within the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amxJ8C"&gt;If this situation seems familiar to you, it’s because Instagram has already been through it (and is still dealing with it). After whistleblower &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;Francis Haugen leaked the Facebook Papers&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of revealing internal Facebook documents, Instagram worked quickly to patch the holes in its sinking ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv8HG9"&gt;The papers show that Facebook did its own research on Instagram’s impact on teens, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;found that the app could wreak havoc on teens’ mental health&lt;/a&gt;, and also made young girls’ body image worse. About a month later, Instagram announced its plans to introduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/10/22719545/instagram-introduce-take-a-break-nudge-teens-harmful-content-facebook"&gt;a feature that will “nudge” teens away&lt;/a&gt; from viewing potentially harmful content. It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774827/instagram-take-a-break-feature-test-meta-facebook"&gt;rolled out a “take a break” feature&lt;/a&gt; that prompts users to close the app if they’ve spent a set amount of time on the platform, ranging from 10, 20, or 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BfObp9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"TikTok reveals some of the secrets, and blind spots, of its recommendation algorithm ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296044/tiktok-for-you-page-algorithm-sides-engagement-data-creators-trends-sounds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a powerful and unconventional music device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QJMGEJ"&gt;At one point in development, Kano Computing’s new music creation device was going to have finger holes. “‘God created man; man is God’s greatest technology,’” explained Ye, the artist &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-58965500"&gt;formerly known as Kanye West&lt;/a&gt;, as Kano CEO and co-founder Alex Klein remembers it. “So when we make technology, maybe it needs to be formed in our image.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjgMjV"&gt;The final product, the Stem Player, which Kano made in partnership with Ye, doesn’t have finger holes. But it is unconventional. It’s a weird music gadget that lets you listen to music and manipulate it in real-time — and even though the holes didn’t come to be, it does fit easily in one of your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8ajRp"&gt;Kano’s device has no screen, meaning you listen and mess with music using a few buttons and four touch-sensitive “stems” on the device. Together, they can be used to manipulate the “stems” (different aspects of a track like the vocals or the drums) from songs off Ye’s album &lt;em&gt;Donda, &lt;/em&gt;which is pre-loaded on the device. Or, thanks to machine learning, it can pull off the same trick with any album you put on it.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These buttons on one edge have a satisfying give.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This small speaker gets surprisingly loud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tQsw25"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/"&gt;Stem Player&lt;/a&gt; came together over a few years. Klein says he and Ye first started working together ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;Jesus is King&lt;/em&gt;, which came out in 2019. They apparently hammered out the idea of “what was then called an album device” in Ye’s Lamborghini one day. (Ye saw Klein on a walk to get falafel and told him to get in the car.) Things coalesced around the release of &lt;em&gt;Donda&lt;/em&gt; so that they could launch it alongside the album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYuotk"&gt;Turn the Stem Player on, and you’re greeted with a gentle vibration and four colored lights appearing on each of the stems. Press the button in the middle to play music — when I did so while writing this, the drum beats on “Hurricane” and The Weeknd’s soaring vocals filled my office. But if I want to hear &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; The Weeknd, all I have to do is “slide” the lights down three of the stems like I’m pushing sliders on a soundboard to fade out the other aspects of the song. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PGhhh0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’re not limited to manipulating one stem at a time&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwvjEx"&gt;You’re not limited to manipulating one stem at a time, either. I’ve used four fingers to adjust all of the stems simultaneously, and the Stem Player kept up with everything I did. (Though I definitely made the song sound much worse.) You can also make loops and add effects in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Q36P"&gt;The device is nice to hold and fun to play with. It’s also soft to the touch, which makes it stand out from the many other metal and plastic gadgets I interact with every day. Klein tells me the exterior is a “unique blend” made of “many different polymers,” and I believe him — the Stem Player doesn’t feel like anything I’ve ever held. (More than once, I’ve found myself idly playing with it in one hand while at my desk.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPzTCH"&gt;Since everything is in reach of your fingers, it’s easy to mess around with songs as you’re listening to them. Adding effects and making loops is less intuitive — I had to look up a tutorial on how. But messing with the stems is entertaining enough on its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5pNgN"&gt;“We wanted it to be a device that you pick up, you feel it, you see the lights, you feel the vibrations, and it will give you this sense of well being and control, which I think is missing from a lot of screen-based devices today,” Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpZYd2"&gt;That said, I haven’t felt pulled to listen to an entire album with the Stem Player in hand. Music for me is largely a background activity; I’ll often put on music while doing chores or while on a run, which aren’t exactly ideal times to also be messing with the Stem Player. But I would never claim to be a music producer — my music-playing experience consists largely of years of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cy0gmKbine8?t=55"&gt;marching band&lt;/a&gt; — so for someone who likes to make their own music, the Stem Player could be a mind-blowingly awesome tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1Scb4U"&gt;“At the end of the day, there were so many directions it could go, and one thing that Ye always prizes and almost coaches me on, gives me good direction on, is to get things finished,” Klein said. “Finish things, put them out. There’s always things you can do to tweak and change them. A great work of art is never finished. Really, it’s abandoned.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV loses ESPN, other Disney networks after failing to reach new deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disney Store In London" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KRQSZ8rsOJRkLGrBM4H92Yf8idM=/0x0:5123x3415/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290174/1236794676.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;photo by Mike Kemp/In Pictures via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IIpNoJ"&gt;YouTube TV has failed to reach an eleventh-hour deal with Disney to keep more than a dozen Disney-owned channels on the live TV streaming service. As of December 18th, popular networks including ESPN and ABC have been removed from the service. As promised, YouTube TV has dropped its subscription to $50 per month as a direct result of the lost programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RmJt1"&gt;Disney said in a statement late Friday that after ongoing negotiations with YouTube TV, “they have declined to reach a fair deal with us based on market terms and conditions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59idpb"&gt;“As a result, their subscribers have lost access to our unrivaled portfolio of networks including live sports and news plus kids, family and general entertainment programming from ABC, the ESPN networks, the Disney channels, Freeform, the FX networks and the National Geographic channels,” the company added. “We stand ready to reach an equitable agreement with Google as quickly as possible in order to minimize the inconvenience to YouTube TV viewers by restoring our networks. We hope Google will join us in that effort.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yybvk"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-tv-and-disney-programming-update/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube TV said it would “continue conversations with Disney to advocate on your behalf in hopes of restoring their content on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SL1MYp"&gt;“We’ve held good faith negotiations with Disney for several months,” YouTube TV said. “Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we’ve been unable to reach an equitable agreement before our existing one expired, and their channels are no longer available on YouTube TV.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEBkGZ"&gt;The announcement follows a notice shared with subscribers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22833849/youtube-tv-disney-carrier-dispute-abc-news-espn-december-17"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; that the channels could vanish from YouTube TV on Friday, December 17th if a deal was not reached between the two companies. Should negotiations have failed, YouTube TV said it would lower its price by $15 a month from its normal price of $65 per month to compensate for the change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68xPDf"&gt;Earlier this week, a positive resolution to the service loss seemed likely. For one, the service told subscribers in an email on Monday that the House of Mouse “is an important partner for us,” adding that it hoped to negotiate a deal with Disney “provided we can reach equitable terms.” But the companies failed to reach a deal as their current agreement lapsed after December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAjBqy"&gt;The loss of over a dozen channels doesn’t exactly help YouTube TV remain competitive against other internet cable services like Hulu with Live TV or Fubo TV. Not only are a dozen-plus channels getting wiped from service, but the list of Disney-owned properties that would be axed is extensive, including not only Disney channels but FX, ESPN, and National Geographic channels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mt6lX8"&gt;The full list of channels that left because a deal was not reached include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kSVKDl"&gt;Your local ABC channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gFaE4O"&gt;ABC News Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72HTNZ"&gt;Disney Channel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ewvx48"&gt;Disney Junior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pZSi1J"&gt;Disney XD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iqBij3"&gt;Freeform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8KgIcc"&gt;FX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="U7e16Q"&gt;FXX&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5zOJgq"&gt;FXM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XlAuvW"&gt;National Geographic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vWgOJw"&gt;National Geographic Wild&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eHN7rI"&gt;ESPN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="38eRKt"&gt;ESPN2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cgi7xm"&gt;ESPN3 (by authentication to the ESPN app)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I7dODa"&gt;ESPNU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwESS1"&gt;ESPNEWS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1o3Azw"&gt;SEC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SKLTHR"&gt;ACC Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Kw6GWW"&gt;Carriage disputes are frustratingly common in our new streaming landscape, and they often play out publicly before a resolution is reached — as was the case recently with YouTube TV and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/2/22701682/youtube-tv-reaches-deal-nbcuniversal-carriage-channels"&gt;NBCUniversal-owned channels&lt;/a&gt;. Less frequently, two parties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495642/youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-networks-streaming-sinclair-mlb-nhl-nba"&gt;fail to reach a deal&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the consumer who winds up paying the price by having to shop around for a new provider if they want support for their favorite programming.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s new flagship soundbar shoots voices up in the air so you can hear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZwFXRCFQPqTEb2RB9xSi_B1gnfY=/201x0:2360x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70290131/LG_Soundbar_01_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4EGjE"&gt;LG has &lt;a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-premium-soundbar-from-lg-delivers-next-level-audio-for-todays-at-home-lifestyle/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new 9.1.5-channel Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundbar featuring a novel upward firing center speaker that bounces dialogue off the celling and to your ears so you can hear clearly. While up-firing drivers are a big part of how soundbars produce surround sound in general — it’s one of five here — LG claims the up-firing center is a world-first. The soundbar also includes a pair of wireless rear speakers that can now additionally send audio to the side walls of the room, which could also increase the audio immersion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htKUdc"&gt;It’s important to note that the new up-firing center speaker is still the same channel as the regular center, but adds to the clarity of dialogue. Same goes for the two extra side-firing drivers of the rear speaker pair; it’s the same channel as the side speakers of the soundbar. LG claims its AI Room Calibration can auto configure the timings of each speaker and sync up everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twPfQw"&gt;This new LG soundbar (model S95QR), its rear speakers, and the included wireless subwoofer collectively have a power output of 810W. With both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, the LG S95QR is positioned as a premium soundbar and a successor to the 7.1.4-channel LG SP11RA soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwytbA"&gt;Unfortunately, the new soundbar — like its predecessor — still does not support passthrough for 4K 120Hz with HDR. If you have a newer 4K HDR TV and a Series X or PS5, you might not want to plug your game console directly into the bar. You should still get the benefit of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) support, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5wYI3_XusYjSkKM1Sj105R5c2LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23110301/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_5.45.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visual representation of LG’s 7.1.4-channel soundbar configuration. To get to 9.1.5, imagine a third wave firing up from the soundbar (center) and two waves shooting from the rear speakers to the left/right walls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXarET"&gt;The soundbar also supports Auto Low-Latency Mode (ALLM) and can be controlled using smart devices with Google Assistant, Alexa, and “other AI assistants”. The older LG SP11RA soundbar had AirPlay 2 support and could be controlled using Siri, but it’s not clear from LG’s press release if the new soundbar also features it (but we’re hopeful).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGcPyK"&gt;LG also says there’s support for its Wowcast Wi-Fi audio dongle, which was originally released this past fall, and is available on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fuk%2Fspeakers-sound-systems%2Flg-wtp3%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s UK page&lt;/a&gt;. The Wowcast is a device that makes the soundbar wireless, for situations where running a cable between the TV and the soundbar would be difficult. It mounts behind your TV and can stream an HDMI eARC connection between it and the soundbar. LG says the Wowcast will be sold separately, so we expect a US release alongside the new soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAQwLP"&gt;LG did not share a price or release date for the new LG S95QR, though. The soundbar will be among the first of the company’s products being announced and displayed in its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fglobal%2Fces2022&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F17%2F22841919%2Flg-s95qr-soundbar-ces-2022-with-upward-firing-center-channel" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;virtual CES 2022 booth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas sold more than $22 million in NFTs, but it hit a few snags along the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTy1vLBVc8MzwKRJ1rOen5iwrDY=/30x0:813x522/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289854/Screen_Shot_2021_12_17_at_5.28.28_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adidas’ NFTs were quite popular.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CsP7xb"&gt;All 30,000 of Adidas’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22822143/adidas-nft-launch-into-the-metaverse-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt; NFTs&lt;/a&gt; were minted within a matter of hours of going on sale Friday. Each NFT cost 0.2 ETH, which currently equates to about $765, and the company sold 29,620 NFTs (“Adidas and partners” held onto 380 for “future events”), meaning the company earned more than $22 million from the sales in the span of an afternoon. (The price of Ethereum has been falling while writing this story, making an exact number difficult to pinpoint.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X7iQWg"&gt;Adidas made the NFTs in partnership with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Punks Comics, and GMoney (a pseudonymous crypto enthusiast). Buying an NFT gives owners access to special physical goods, like a hoodie and the tracksuit worn by the Bored Ape that Adidas owns, and upcoming digital experiences. However, the physical merch won’t be available until 2022, &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse%2Ffaq&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Adidas’ FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, so buyers essentially just put in expensive pre-orders for the clothes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zqjO1H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adidas offered 20,000 NFTs in early access&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vmo3Ld"&gt;The company offered 20,000 of the NFTs in early access to people who own special Adidas Originals tokens, GMoney tokens, Bored Ape Yacht Club NFTs, Mutant Ape Yacht Club NFTs, and Pixel Vault NFTs — making an already hard-to-get NFT available first to a very limited set of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRH3J0"&gt;Early access minting began &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471909577658675204"&gt;shortly before 1:30PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, but Adidas quickly hit an issue with Mutant Ape Yacht Club owners not being able to mint the NFTs that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471914441591640065"&gt;forced it to pause&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471938993797632000"&gt;Adidas has promised&lt;/a&gt; to reimburse everyone who lost gas fees (which are fees taken in order to mint the NFT) while there were problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ALxRQ"&gt;Early access &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471958608363589637"&gt;resumed at 5PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, and public minting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adidasoriginals/status/1471978538635087875"&gt;kicked off at 6PM ET&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when the NFTs were fully sold out, but Adidas’ website showed that &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse%2Fmint&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the NFTs had been minted&lt;/a&gt; minutes after the public sale began. However, one person &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UntagP/status/1471986754588581890"&gt;was apparently&lt;/a&gt; able to mint many of the NFTs, which may have disrupted how many were actually available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fxNyFn"&gt;It’s unclear if Adidas plans to offer more NFTs in the future, but it teases on its website that &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adidas.com%2Finto_the_metaverse&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“this is just the beginning.”&lt;/a&gt; Given how quickly the first batch sold out — and how much money Adidas made in just a few hours — it seems unlikely this will be the only NFT offering from the apparel maker. And it will almost certainly want to compete against archrival Nike, which just bought a company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;that makes virtual shoes and NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBZ0yV"&gt;Other companies may also be looking at the success of Adidas’ NFTs with dollar signs in their eyes, but before they rush to the nearest blockchain, they might want to consider the cautionary tale of the planned NFTs for &lt;em&gt;S.T.A.K.E.R. 2&lt;/em&gt;. Developer GSC Game World announced the NFTs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; but received swift backlash from fans. The developers tried to lower the heat by tweeting out an explanation on Thursday, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840383/stalker-2-developer-explain-nfts-gsc-game-world-deleted-tweet"&gt;quickly deleted that&lt;/a&gt; before announcing it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840488/stalker-2-nft-metahuman-gsc-web3-canceled"&gt;canceling its NFT plans altogether&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The story of Elizabeth Holmes now belongs to the jury  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lawyers Make Closing Arguments In Elizabeth Holmes Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v1GcW8yIpkP_D9N2x6QhiDdO4nY=/0x80:3883x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289827/1359543294.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;They’ll decide whether or not she was the one in control&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hHNPqT"&gt;From the beginning, Elizabeth Holmes knew how to tell a good story. She launched her blood testing company, Theranos, with a tale of a powerful vision to revolutionize health care and change an old, outdated industry. She presented herself as Steve Jobs, part two. She sketched out a picture of someone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22820995/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-testimony-defense-abuse"&gt;in control.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GdIYI2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;That &lt;/em&gt;Holmes, and that story, is what prosecutor John Bostic worked to reset back to during his rebuttal argument, the last word before the case went to the jury on Friday afternoon. It wasn’t reasonable to think the CEO of a company didn’t know exactly what impression she was giving to investors, Bostic said. It was clear she &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;knew about problems&lt;/a&gt; with the Theranos tests. Holmes knew that the technology wasn’t working as intended, and that Theranos might not be able to change the world. When that story started to fall apart, she tried anything she could to try and keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qm4ZPT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We admire people who set ambitious goals and set out to achieve them”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1sQh3"&gt;“We admire people who set ambitious goals and set out to achieve them,” Bostic said. “Instead, we see a CEO of a company so desperate for success, so afraid of failure, that she was willing to do anything to keep that company from failing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S49S1i"&gt;But in the closing arguments of her trial for fraud, which wrapped up Friday, her defense attorney Kevin Downey also told a story. This story was about a well-meaning CEO who trusted what experts told her, who didn’t know about problems at her company, and who couldn’t be faulted if people misinterpreted the things she told them about Theranos. It relied on undercutting the origin story in order to convince the jury that she wasn’t guilty of the charges against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgLX0c"&gt;To find her guilty of those charges — wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud — the jury has to believe Holmes &lt;em&gt;intended&lt;/em&gt; to give people misleading information about what the Theranos technology could do. That intent matters, Downey stressed through his closing arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvrHA0"&gt;Figuring out that intent takes getting inside Holmes’ head during the times she lied or said things that could be misleading. When Holmes told investors and reporters that the Theranos devices could run hundreds of accurate tests, Downey said she actually was referring to what the company was going to be able to do in the future, on future iterations of the Theranos device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJQl93"&gt;And when Holmes told investor Bryan Tolbert, vice president of finance for Texas-based Hall Group, that the company was “doing a lot of work” with the military, she didn’t mean that Theranos devices were actively in use in the military — just that the company was working towards that goal. (Investors say Holmes told them the company’s devices were used in Afghanistan and on medevacs.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYqIG9"&gt;If investors got the wrong idea, well, that was because they misinterpreted things, Downey said. And, even if they did misinterpret things, that didn’t actually matter, he said. Those types of statements from Holmes weren’t why investors decided to give Theranos money. Holmes and the things she said weren’t actually that critical to the decision making process, Downey said. Investors just cared that Theranos had a partnership with Walgreens. (Multiple investors said they trusted the stories Holmes told them about Theranos’ capabilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvmLdo"&gt;Holmes also couldn’t be responsible for any problems with the Theranos technology, Downey said. Other people were responsible — like former Theranos lab director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22692600/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-bad-tests-complaints"&gt;Adam Rosendorff&lt;/a&gt;. Holmes thought the tests were accurate. She saw positive reviews from satisfied customers, and the company apologized any time there was an error. She had no reason to think there were any issues that she needed to be concerned about, Downey said. (In fact, Theranos’ scientists repeatedly flagged serious issues to Holmes in emails revealed throughout the trial.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEVD0T"&gt;Holmes didn’t behave as someone who had something to hide, Downey said. She hired a high-profile board of directors — a former secretary of state, a former senator, a retired Marine Corps four-star general. She allowed people from drug companies and academic institutions to scrutinize her company’s tech. She gave information to the Food and Drug Administration. And, when news reports and a federal investigation found problems with her labs, she doubled down on work to figure out what went wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nc5MxE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You know that at the first sign of trouble, crooks cash out, criminals cover up, and rats flee a sinking ship”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bqsetv"&gt;“You know that at the first sign of trouble, crooks cash out, criminals cover up, and rats flee a sinking ship,” Downey said. But Holmes was a devoted CEO who believed that her company was going to change the world. Instead of running, she brought in experts to scrutinize the testing program, Downey noted. “Are those the actions of someone who had been engaged in a conspiracy to defraud people?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BunTUQ"&gt;There are versions of Holmes everywhere: there’s the one she offered in media interviews, the ones sketched out in podcasts, the one that will be fictionalized in the upcoming Hulu series. Over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;past three months,&lt;/a&gt; there have been two more, presented by prosecutors and defense attorneys. Now, those versions go to the jurors. It’s up to them to decide which story is the closest to reality — and if that reality is criminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3eKKt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVpOmB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yVVGM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="072vdG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Movie theaters are breaking records thanks to Spider-Man, even as omicron spreads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ayOsX7aiwhaLugz31t4pEJ888sQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70289609/acastro_210813_1777_theater_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvpiDI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; eclipsed previous box office records on its first night at some of the biggest theater chains in the nation. That’s big news for theaters whose continued existence seemed under threat at the start of the pandemic, and it suggests moviegoers’ interest hasn’t yet changed dramatically in response to the latest COVID variant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLWODg"&gt;AMC announced Friday that roughly &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Theatres-Eclipses-Box-Office-Records-With-SPIDER-MAN-NO-WAY-HOME-Achieving-Highest-December-Opening-Night-Ever-and-Second-Highest-Opening-Night-of-All-Time-/default.aspx"&gt;1.1 million moviegoers&lt;/a&gt; attended the opening night of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, making it the highest-grossing opening night for a December title in AMC’s history. Cinemark &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Theatres-Eclipses-Box-Office-Records-With-SPIDER-MAN-NO-WAY-HOME-Achieving-Highest-December-Opening-Night-Ever-and-Second-Highest-Opening-Night-of-All-Time-/default.aspx"&gt;called the film’s debut&lt;/a&gt; its “best opening night of all time.” And Regal said the film became its second-highest Thursday box office title in its history and &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/spider-man-no-way-home-swings-into-regal-with-second-biggest-thursday-ever-with-imax-4dx-screenx-and-rpx-outperforming-301447693.html"&gt;shattered records&lt;/a&gt; for IMAX, 4DX, ScreenX, and RPX formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biQ1xt"&gt;“The anticipation for &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; has completely exceeded our expectations,” Mooky Greidinger, CEO of Regal parent Cineworld, said in a statement. “We are just as excited as our moviegoers to see our favorite webslinger back on the big screen at Regal and we would like to thank our friends at Sony for delivering another amazing tentpole.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DWWJ75"&gt;Justin McDaniel, Cinemark SVP of global content, said that the number of moviegoers who flocked to the premiere “underscores the irreplaceable value of the in-theatre experience, which we are thrilled to continue to offer in collaboration with our studio partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDVrcF"&gt;While the film is &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/12/spider-man-no-way-home-50m-preview-easily-pandemic-record-all-time-for-sony-100m-friday-likely-1234898486/"&gt;expected to perform well&lt;/a&gt; heading into the weekend, it’s unclear what effect the omicron variant will have on &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt;’s performance going forward. Much is still unknown about the variant, such as whether omicron causes more severe illness or death than the original virus and the Delta variant, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/omicron-variant.html"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;. However, breakthrough cases in those who are vaccinated are expected to happen, the agency said, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22814974/anime-nyc-omicron-case-coronavirus-covid-19-superspreader"&gt;examples of which&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buzzfeed-staffers-test-positive-for-covid-19-following-holiday-party-2021-12"&gt;we’ve already seen&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ExXJd"&gt;Also unclear is how theaters plan to navigate the omicron variant’s spread. None of the major US distributors returned &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s requests for comment on Thursday about moviegoer safety protocols and whether exhibition delays and closures could be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsH36k"&gt;Given the unknowns, it’s a bit early for theaters to be taking another &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641318/hybrid-film-releases-cinemacon-theater-exclusivity"&gt;pandemic victory lap&lt;/a&gt; — shattered records or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
