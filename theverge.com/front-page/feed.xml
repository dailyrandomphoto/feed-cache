    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Amazon Prime Day, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $25, and while it’s currently not available at that price, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have temporarily discounted it to $45. There is also a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other info that is available for $60, the full retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the Kids Edition is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers for $5 off, bringing the price down to $55. Amazon is also selling a discounted bundle for $75, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Amazon does &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08M1MRHN2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offer a $100 bundle that includes a free Ring Smart Bulb&lt;/a&gt;, though, and Target is currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal/-/A-80770246/&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22362455%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 38,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which was launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2-megapixel camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The second-gen model is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $85, however, you can also pick up the last-gen model at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa-charcoal%2F-%2FA-76526131%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtgtao%26DFA%3D71700000012807845%26CPNG%3DPLA_Electronics%252BShopping_Local%257CElectronics_Ecomm_Hardlines%26adgroup%3DSC_Electronics%26LID%3D700000001170770pgs%26LNM%3DPRODUCT_GROUP%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9061079%26targetid%3Dpla-990594042919%26ds_rl%3D1246978%26ds_rl%3D1248099%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwo4mIBhBsEiwAKgzXOLrJxn1_3VD1UR7wtcFcAcvw397zeAm5Hp9bimjK6d6Phv9g3whA2xoCMfYQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747625078603978178#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $45, its lowest price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently only available for $110 — its full retail price — at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-generation Echo Show 8 is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742759409782754841#donotlink?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%2Fthis-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1082904/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https://www.target.com/p/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen/-/A-83387876&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22299044%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/this-is-my-next%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $130. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle that contains a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blink Mini for $140&lt;/a&gt; or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/echo-show-10/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini security camera for $260. Target is also &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeSmartDisplaysforHome061621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering $100 off a pair of Echo Show 10s&lt;/a&gt; at checkout through August 28th, bringing the price of two down to $400.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZthONz"&gt;Today, NYC Mayor Bill De Blasio &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2pmlJ6WY26k?t=448"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; details of the “Key to NYC Pass,” a plan to require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 before entering locations like fitness centers, restaurants, or entertainment venues. New Yorkers can meet those requirements by carrying their vaccination card or scanning and storing it in one of two authorized mobile apps. While some businesses and events have already begun to require proof of vaccination or a recent negative COVID test for entry by workers and customers, government-mandated “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356333/covid-vaccine-certification-passport-biden"&gt;vaccine passports&lt;/a&gt;” have been a controversial topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MsJXe4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Soon you will not be able to go inside a restaurant, inside a gym, or inside a concert or performance in New York City without proof of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#COVID19&lt;/a&gt; vaccine. Join us now for more info. &lt;a href="https://t.co/oVKhBC3Ptr"&gt;https://t.co/oVKhBC3Ptr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NYCMayorsOffice/status/1422563052168286210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0F3ql"&gt;The spread of the highly contagious Delta variant is being cited as a reason to increase restrictions without returning to a full lockdown or other measures. The program is scheduled to launch on August 13th, with enforcement slated to start on September 13th. It doesn’t introduce any new documentation; the name is a reference to it serving as a “key” to the city’s recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsE9FO"&gt;Workers and patrons can confirm their vaccination status (at least one dose administered) in one of three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JptXVK"&gt;Vaccination card&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BeHPgJ"&gt;NYC COVID Safe exposure notification app (&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nyc-covid-safe/id1565213506"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.nyc.doitt.covidsafe&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jGg6AI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/excelsior-pass"&gt;NYS Excelsior Pass app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="f1hfzv"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nyc-require-proof-vaccination-indoor-activities-mayor-2021-08-03/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mentions, NYC has already begun several other initiatives to get people vaccinated, including a mandate for city employees (or else face weekly testing) and a $100 incentive for the public. NYC data shows about 60 percent of residents have received at least one dose of a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New DaBaby tie-in discovered in Fortnite update, Epic declines to comment on it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xf5yXZ"&gt;Epic Games only released the v17.30 update for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; early Tuesday morning, but data miners have apparently found a new file within it: audio for an emote based on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/owypfn/migos_ft_dababy_am_to_pm_encrypted_emote_audio/"&gt;Migos song “AM to PM” that features DaBaby&lt;/a&gt;, a rapper who has received widespread criticism for homophobic comments toward people with HIV and AIDS he made &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/celebrities-activists-condemn-rapper-dababys-homophobic-comments-rcna1535"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. A file being found in the game doesn’t guarantee that it will be available for players, but it can be a hint about content Epic has been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDIHH0"&gt;DaBaby has faced criticism since at least the Rolling Loud music festival on July 25th, where &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZayBelvin/status/1419476520276475904"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kpxaBG"&gt;If you didn’t show up today with HIV, AIDS, any of them deadly sexually transmitted diseases that’ll make you die in two, three weeks, then put your cellphone light up. Ladies, if your pussy smell like water, put a cellphone light up. Fellas, if you ain’t sucking n**** dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lights up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qweJLD"&gt;He later leaned in on his Instagram Stories, &lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/dababy-doubles-down-homophobic-rant-141029280.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Yahoo News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4LZIzr"&gt;I’m gonna address this weak-ass internet shit one time, and then I’mma get back to giving my love to my fans, ’cause what me and my fans do at the live show, it don’t concern you n***** on the internet or you bitter bitches on the internet. I said, ‘If you don’t got AIDS, put a cellphone lighter up.’ I said, ‘If you ain’t suck dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lights up.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTRZh8"&gt;All the lights went up — gay or straight — you wanna know why? Because even my gay fans don’t got fucking AIDS, stupid ass n*****. They don’t got AIDS. My gay fans, they take care of themselves. They ain’t no nasty gay n*****, see what I’m saying? They ain’t no junkies on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DPc8SV"&gt;Since then, DaBaby has been dropped from multiple festivals, including &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/dababy-dropped-from-lollapalooza-2021-following-homophobic-remarks/"&gt;last weekend’s Lollapalooza&lt;/a&gt; and the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dababy-dropped-austin-city-limits-iheartradio-festivals-1206718/"&gt;Austin City Limits, Music Midtown, iHeartRadio Music Festival&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/dababy-dropped-from-governors-ball-2021-following-homophobic-comments/"&gt;Governors Ball&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dababy-day-n-vegas-dropped-homophobic-1206141/"&gt;Day N Vegas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSFMMBbpc3F/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;On Instagram, he posted an apology&lt;/a&gt; for the “hurtful and triggering comments I made.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CSFMMBbpc3F/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading" style=" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;" target="_blank"&gt;A post shared by LONG LIVE G (@dababy)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="njIDJn"&gt;The possible emote found by data miners in the 17.30 files wouldn’t be the first featuring music from DaBaby in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, as Epic has put &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eE96SSKn3q8"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMTROYAisNM"&gt;emotes&lt;/a&gt; based on his song “BOP on Broadway” and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iWduN9U10g"&gt;one based on “ROCKSTAR”&lt;/a&gt; for sale in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; item shop in the past. But when asked about its plans for releasing the emote found in the 17.30 files and whether it plans to continue to sell the emotes that have already been available, Epic declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcZ9to"&gt;Epic controls what items show up in the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; item shop, so it has the power to determine if emotes with DaBaby will be sold in the future. But in declining to comment, Epic is leaving open the possibility that it may offer the emotes at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze now lets you use Master Chief’s voice as your guide</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RNYJkLVUuWAapNKEJQ33UBsGk7w=/0x58:1125x808/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673843/IMG_2184.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhfBcl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/03/banish-traffic-with-halo-waze-content/"&gt;Master Chief can now tell you when to turn left&lt;/a&gt; or continue straight, thanks to Microsoft and Google teaming up to add &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;-themed content inside Waze. The promotion will also let you get directions from Escharum, the leader of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s antagonists, the Banished. There are also a few other settings that let you make your navigation experience more &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-y, including the ability to have your vehicle show up as a Warthog or Ghost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwLKs0"&gt;To enable the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; experience, open the Waze menu and tap on the “Drive with Master Chief” button. From there, you can set your Mood, car icon, and navigation voice to be UNSC or Banished-themed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OBNEZxVl29MYm4pK09jw_GxMSXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758841/IMG_2186.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s hard to miss the settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q8Bg6HuwSzh-XLhme9TSii2Ev5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758795/IMG_2185.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a very bad idea, given how I drive in Halo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E6H1O5"&gt;You can also select either Master Chief or Escharum as a “Mood,” which will &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/waze/answer/6268700"&gt;change how you appear to other Waze users&lt;/a&gt;. If you happen to live around a bunch of &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; fans who also use Waze, this means your next commute may end up looking like a Race multiplayer match. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1j1xw"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/03/banish-traffic-with-halo-waze-content/"&gt;the Xbox blog post about the promotion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; options are available worldwide, though the Master Chief and Escharum voice directions are only in English, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. The blog also says the content will only be in Waze for a limited time, so if you’re looking to try &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed driving, it’s probably best to try it out soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47e8jw"&gt;It’s worth noting that googling or Twitter searching &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; could be a bit risky at the moment if you don’t want the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; to be spoiled — tons of info about the game’s plot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602811/halo-infinite-story-spoiler-leak-cortana-technical-preview"&gt;leaked onto the internet&lt;/a&gt; after being accidentally included in the game files for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597498/halo-infinite-multiplayer-technical-preview-beta-july-29th"&gt;the multiplayer technical preview&lt;/a&gt; that ran from July 29th to August 2nd. The game is expected to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;at some point this fall&lt;/a&gt;, though some &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-08-01-halo-fans-wonder-if-this-doughnut-ad-has-inadvertently-revealed-halo-infinites-release-month"&gt;have been reading the tea leaves (or, er, donuts)&lt;/a&gt; trying to pin down exactly when it’ll hit store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OtterBox’s latest gaming clip jumps aboard the MagSafe train</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Otterbox MagSafe gaming clip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYK6kH2AtpcOyPAWg1Br0zrEG4M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673837/otterboxmagsafe.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aob8Dy"&gt;OtterBox’s latest gaming controller clip is MagSafe-compatible for iPhone 12 devices, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.otterbox.com/en-us/xbox-x%7Cs--xbox-one--xbox-elite-wireless-series-2-controllers/mobile-gaming-clip-for-magsafe/77-82969.html#tab5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;and it costs $39.99&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338087/otterbox-mobile-gaming-clip-review-xbox-controller-cloud-price"&gt;previous $30 gaming clip&lt;/a&gt; that we reviewed earlier this year, it streamlines the process of connecting your phone to a controller clip by letting it snap on seamlessly with the help of magnets — in other words, MagSafe technology (TM). This solution is preferable to traditional controller clips that clamp around the edges of your phone’s display. I just wish that this one worked with other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQis5B"&gt;Some MagSafe-compatible accessories can also charge iPhone 12-series models, but in this case, OtterBox’s MagSafe gaming clip seems to boil down to “it’s a circular magnetic surface.” There are no other special features listed on its product page, aside from being able to detach the magnetic arm from the controller to serve as a phone stand. Also, you don’t need to own an OtterBox MagSafe case, but the company says you’ll get the “best experience and protection” if you do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Otterbox MagSafe gaming clip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3lTBjPZU0M3ISOevsg-UkFKQGBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759096/otterboxmagsafe2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OtterBox&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The clip can detach from the controller to work in tabletop mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4psGIg"&gt;In terms of controller compatibility, OtterBox says on its site that this new clip will fit the newer Xbox Series X / S controller, the previous Xbox One wireless controller, or the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller. Oddly, it also provides the disclaimer that the clip was designed to “ensure zero interference” with controller functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa2TTX"&gt;It’s easy to read that and think, “Wait, can magnets interfere with Bluetooth?” If that were the case, Bluetooth speakers, among many other devices, wouldn’t operate properly. What I think it means is that your controller will work normally. Perhaps the company just needed another line to plug in that its product has MagSafe compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mDdod"&gt;The MagSafe gaming clip is available now for iPhone 12 owners who want the convenience of attaching their phone to their gaming clip with magnets and don’t mind paying the $10 premium. Otherwise, you can make do with OtterBox’s previous model that works as intended with practically any phone running a modern mobile OS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC chair calls for more power to regulate cryptocurrency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SEC Chairman Gensler Readies More Crypto Oversight To Protect Investors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xEoHpkdQJL_7YjuSFli-XGBdAQc=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673569/1234425306.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BDgFdd"&gt;On Tuesday, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler called on Congress to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-will-police-cryptocurrencies-to-maximum-possible-extent-chair-gary-gensler-says-11628007567?mod=e2twp"&gt;expand the agency’s authority&lt;/a&gt; in regulating cryptocurrency trading, lending, and platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezyOF2"&gt;“Right now, we just don’t have enough investor protection in crypto. Frankly, at this time, it’s more like the Wild West,” Gensler said in a speech to the Aspen Security Forum Tuesday. “We have taken and will continue to take our authorities as far as they go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FypL1s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s more like the Wild West”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xrCnXV"&gt;Over the last few years, cryptocurrency tokens and platforms have flourished as US financial regulators have struggled to develop and apply to the new technology. Last December, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;proposed new regulations&lt;/a&gt; to make it easier for the federal government to track Bitcoin transactions in one of the few moves to monitor the market. But while other securities markets are directly overseen by federal regulators, but there is no single regulator in charge of overseeing cryptocurrencies as a financial market. Cryptocurrencies hit a record capitalization of $2 trillion earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-sec-chair-gensler-calls-162645064.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjTgqQ"&gt;Gensler’s remarks on Tuesday were some of the clearest he’s made regarding his thinking on cryptocurrency. Lawmakers like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) have called on regulators like Gensler to clamp down on the market. “These regulatory gaps endanger consumers and investors and undermine the safety of our financial markets,” Warren wrote &lt;a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/letters/warren-asks-sec-chair-gensler-about-risks-posed-by-cryptocurrency-exchanges"&gt;in a letter to Gensler&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdbqy9"&gt;On Tuesday, Gensler responded by calling on Congress to give the SEC additional authority. “If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt,” Gensler said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTYEKS"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators reached a deal on a $1 trillion infrastructure package that included some language on cryptocurrency markets. Specifically, the bill included changes that would define some players in the market as “brokers,” opening them up to greater IRS scrutiny. As of Tuesday, that language was altered to assuage concerns by the cryptocurrency community, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/02/us/politics/infrastructure-cryptocurrency.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Mac Pro GPUs with new AMD Radeon options</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Mac Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/93TofDu9HVHOOk2O6kqKkMDgKsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673316/awhite_200121_3873_0021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3AQ2yM"&gt;Apple is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-pro%2Ftower%23&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22607730%2Fapple-mac-pro-amd-radeo-pro-gpu-options" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updating to the Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with new graphics card modules on Tuesday, featuring options based on the AMD Radeon Pro W6000 series. The company claims the new Radeon Pro W6800X MPX Module, Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module, and Radeon Pro W6900X MPX module should give a boost to performance for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161358/mac-pro-review-apple-display-xdr-adobe-hardware-software-price-video"&gt;the graphics-heavy tasks Apple designed the Pro around&lt;/a&gt;. Continuing to support the Pro by bringing new GPU options to Apple’s custom Mac Pro Expansion Module (MPX) system is a pretty good sign that the company remains committed to its new, modular design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUaMPb"&gt;AMD &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/press-releases/2021-06-08-new-amd-radeon-pro-w6000-series-workstation-graphics-amd-rdna-2"&gt;first announced the new graphics cards in June this year&lt;/a&gt;, with the promise that the W6800 would bring “up to 79 percent faster performance than the previous generation.” Now a little over two months later, Apple claims in some cases the GPUs in their MPX forms can get “up to 84 percent faster performance when running Octane X” and “up to 23 percent faster performance when using DaVinci Resolve.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/POje37S7NsmOHt_2zFki_P_T6bc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758705/Mac_Pro_with_two_Radeon_Pro_W6800X_Duo_MPX_Modules.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Mac Pro with two Radeon Pro W800X Duo MPX Modules.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FDvlUq"&gt;The GPU modules range in price per the listings on Apple’s store shared below, and each adds an additional four Thunderbolt 3 ports and an HDMI 2.0 port, regardless of the version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u5RoKX"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6800X MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $2,400 “with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth...[and] up to 16.0 teraflops of single-precision or 32.0 teraflops of half-precision computing.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GI7KTj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6800X Duo MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $4,600 for two linked GPUs, “each with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth ... [and] up to 30.2 teraflops of single-precision or 60.4 teraflops of half-precision computing” when two modules installed together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F7KLQG"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Radeon Pro W6900X MPX Module:&lt;/strong&gt; an additional $5,600 “with 32GB of GDDR6 memory delivering up to 512GB/s memory bandwidth ... [and] up to 22.2 teraflops of single-precision or 44.4 teraflops of half-precision computing.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qUc1X3"&gt;Apple says the new GPU modules will replace the previous AMD Radeon Pro Vega II MPX Modules in the configure-to-order options on Apple’s website, and as standalone kits. As part of this new module launch Apple is also specifically phasing out the AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo MPX Module and AMD Radeon Pro Vega II MPX Module, but will still offer both in standalone kits for existing customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Proposed federal standard would require cars to ‘prevent or limit operation’ by impaired drivers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V9tO5Tlx_J1XM7t1J4RNyj5Agnk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69673055/acastro_181106_1777_flag_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a4VdjO"&gt;On Sunday, a bipartisan group of Senators published draft text of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;a massive new bipartisan infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, proposing more than a trillion dollars in spending and a vast array of far-reaching provisions. But a little-noticed section in the bill could have significant implications in the fight against drunk driving, eventually mandating a new in-car safety technology to actively prevent Americans from driving while impaired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnYIz1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/3684/text"&gt;Introduced under the heading “Advanced Impaired Driving Technology,”&lt;/a&gt; the provision would require the Department of Transportation to set a new standard for detecting and preventing impaired driving. The bill calls on the secretary of transportation to release a standard within three years, with the requirement taking effect for new cars three years after that. The specific provisions of the standard are vague, but it would require cars to “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired” and “prevent or limit motor vehicle operation” if impairment is detected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4qDIDo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system would “passively monitor the performance of a driver ... to identify whether that driver may be impaired”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ahbAJ"&gt;The specific means of creating that system are still undetermined, but advocates say much of the technology is already available. Driver monitoring systems, which track a driver’s face or eyelids to ensure they are alert and actively piloting the vehicle, are already offered in some models by &lt;a href="https://lexusenthusiast.com/2007/09/08/a-look-at-the-lexus-ls-600hls-driver-monitoring-system/"&gt;Lexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/cars/news/bmw/146565-bmw-live-cockpit-bmw-operating-system-7-0-infotainment"&gt;BMW&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/mercedes-looks-to-new-sensors-so-lavish-2021-s-class-is-more-user-friendly-10628510/"&gt;Mercedes Benz&lt;/a&gt;. Systems like lane detection could also be used to detect impairment, creating an alert if the driver is consistently veering outside their lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bntwDc"&gt;“Twenty years ago, this technology didn’t exist,” says Jason Levine of the Center for Auto Safety. “[But] we have the technology available now. We can install tech in vehicles that helps to monitor whether someone is impaired and stops that person from hurting themselves or others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vphdkP"&gt;Crucially, the new standard wouldn’t be limited to drunk drivers. Because the systems measure impairment directly, they would be just as effective at detecting impairment from prescription drugs, emotional distress, or simple distraction. A longer-term effort would also seek to mandate passive alcohol monitoring systems, like those &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volvocars-safety/safety-first-volvo-to-add-in-car-sensors-to-prevent-drunk-driving-idUSKCN1R11SB"&gt;currently being developed by Volvo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqklaZ"&gt;While the provisions are aimed at creating a new mandatory requirement for automakers, such a requirement is still a long way off. Negotiations around the infrastructure bill are still in flux, and the provision could still be removed or altered by lawmakers. Even if it passes into law, the Department of Transportation will have wide leeway in how and when to implement the requirement and could easily delay it beyond the schedule set by Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27EskP"&gt;Still, auto safety advocates see this as a rare opportunity to fight back against impaired driving, which causes as many as 10,000 deaths a year by some estimates. “This will take some time, but you have to start somewhere,” says Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. “Seatbelts, airbags, electronic stability control: all of those technologies started with this kind of rulemaking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eEV58i"&gt;Still, the new measures could face significant political blowback. Previous safety measures were essentially additional features protecting users in the event of a crash. But an impaired driving detector would directly limit the functionality of the vehicle, preventing users from driving at a moment when they would otherwise choose to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tye40"&gt;But for auto safety advocates, the rising death toll from impaired driving is simply too urgent to ignore. “I think [the political fight] is a very real concern,” Chase says, “but we also have these victims whose family members were taken from them because someone got behind the wheel while impaired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHaMur"&gt;For auto safety advocates like Levine, it’s a proposal that’s worth fighting for. “Will there be some people who don’t like this feature? Sure,” he says. “What we’ve got is a generational opportunity to stop adding lists of victims of drunk drivers to these memorials, and do so in a way that is using existing technology and getting after the performance as opposed to the behavior.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Chromebooks will now have Google Meet installed by default</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a Google Meet meeting on a Chromebook that includes five participants." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njGW2i-o9g9ty-a8TbWzGhQIGFI=/31x0:969x625/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672919/5_people.max_1000x1000.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Google Meet app on Chrome OS.&lt;/em&gt; | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oPQ5Us"&gt;With Chrome OS’s latest update, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/express-yourself-and-connect-with-others-on-chromebooks/"&gt;Google has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its Google Meet app will be preinstalled on all Chromebooks. The announcement is part of the company’s larger push to adapt its operating system for remote meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SKKoA"&gt;The new feature shouldn’t make too much of a difference to longtime Chromebook users who already have a preferred video chat platform installed. But for new students receiving a Chromebook for the first time, or other folks who are trying the platform out, it could certainly mean the difference between using Google Meet for meetings and social calls or turning to competitors like Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4b1zE2"&gt;Google also says it’s made performance improvements to Google Meet’s experience, including “adapting video calls to different network conditions and adjusting video performance during screen sharing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Qm7K"&gt;Updating Chrome OS hasn’t installed Google Meet in our recent testing, so this update only appears to apply to new Chromebooks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a Chrome window on a Chromebook with the new emoji picker emanating from the top text field." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IV_Xtc-mdrcaT6NN-pJOiMEj7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758615/EmojiPicker_Default_EmojiInserted_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See your recently used emojis first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0m4gZn"&gt;The update also includes an updated emoji picker with a search bar (which you can bring up with the shortcut Launcher + Shift + Space), support for eSIM on eSIM-compatible Chromebooks (including the recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22412759/acer-chromebook-spin-513-review-specs-price"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 513&lt;/a&gt;), a new digital magazine for kids and families in the Explore app, and a new collection of wallpapers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix documentary Countdown will follow SpaceX’s first civilian mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mcsYM3O_S4eL_cCV10QxGk9pY7c=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69672751/Countdown_Inspiration4_Mission_To_Space_DSC_4204.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Inspiration4/John Kraus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ywp3kp"&gt;The first “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;all-civilian&lt;/a&gt;” mission to space is set to blast off on a SpaceX rocket in mid-September, and the process of getting those astronauts trained and (eventually) into orbit will be documented in a new five-part Netflix series called &lt;em&gt;Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission To Space&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuLLEi"&gt;Announced Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Countdown &lt;/em&gt;is being billed by Netflix as the first documentary series from the streaming company to cover an event in “near real-time.” Netflix says the first two episodes will arrive on September 6th, followed by two more on September 13th. The company says SpaceX is targeting September 15th for the launch, and if that schedule holds, the fifth episode — a “feature-length finale” — will premiere by the end of the month. The documentary is being co-produced by Time Studios and will be directed by Jason Hehir, who created the Michael Jordan series &lt;em&gt;The Last Dance&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ip66cg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;From the director of ‘The Last Dance’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LB2tG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;A StoryBots Space Adventure, &lt;/em&gt;a “hybrid live-action animation special for kids and families,” is also in the works and will air September 14th. The show will explain the basics of the mission, how rockets work, and how people eat and sleep in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDogwm"&gt;Elon Musk’s space company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;revealed the civilian mission in February&lt;/a&gt;, which will see the crew live in the Dragon spacecraft for up to five days in orbit around the Earth. The CEO said at the time that he considers it an “important milestone towards enabling access to space for everyone.” It’s being commanded by Jared Isaacman, the CEO of Shift4 Payments, who is also using the mission to raise $200 million for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. (Isaacman donated the first $100 million to St. Jude when the mission was announced and is trying to raise $100 million more.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjxW6w"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Never imagined a Netflix documentary when we kicked off &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inspiration4x?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inspiration4x&lt;/a&gt; just 8 months ago.  Amazing how fast things come together.  Proceeds from this directly benefit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StJude?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StJude&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; our $200 million fundraising objective. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7Wslcd6m8a"&gt;https://t.co/7Wslcd6m8a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jared Isaacman (@rookisaacman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rookisaacman/status/1422585135698878467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MAsZYu"&gt;SpaceX has since announced the three other civilians who will join Isaacman on the trip: geosciences professor (and two-time NASA astronaut candidate) Sian Proctor, who will be the “mission pilot”; Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude and pediatric cancer survivor, who will become the first person in space with a prosthetic body part; and US Air Force veteran (and Lockheed Martin engineer) Chris Sembroski.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5Oiv4"&gt;As long as everything goes as planned, the Inspiration4 launch will be the realization of a longtime goal for Musk and SpaceX. The company has booked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465134/spacex-axiom-space-sign-bulk-deal-private-crew-dragon-missions"&gt;at least four other private missions&lt;/a&gt; on its Crew Dragon capsule and one on its massive Starship rocket, which — once fully developed — will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309546/japanese-billionaire-maezawa-dear-moon-spacex"&gt;fly around the Moon and back&lt;/a&gt;. Inspiration4 will wind up being the second space tourism launch of the year, though. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;Jeff Bezos joined three others on the first human mission&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s New Shepherd rocket / capsule combination in July. And Virgin Galactic is getting close to flying its first paying customers as soon as next year — the company’s billionaire founder Richard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Branson rode to the edge of space with three other company employees&lt;/a&gt; in July to test the company’s SpaceShipTwo cabin experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQAFj3"&gt;Neither of those missions went into orbit, though, which requires far more speed and precision to achieve. SpaceX has already sent government&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;astronauts to orbit (and then to the International Space Station) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;three times&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fG16zG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVXSIO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
