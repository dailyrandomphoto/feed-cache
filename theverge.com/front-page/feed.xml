    <title>Google introducing a feature in Chrome 90 to create links to highlighted text on a webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUclObS02E-f6lIvl6OO_Z-EiGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143488/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1h5rqm"&gt;An upcoming feature in Chrome 90 will allow users to create a link to a section of a website that they’ve highlighted. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295300/google-link-to-text-fragment-chrome-extension-chromium-highlight-scroll-down"&gt;launched as a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; called Link to Text Fragment last year, Google has now added the feature within Chrome itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDkFv7"&gt;The new feature is still rolling out to users; I wasn’t able to get it to work even after I updated to Chrome 90. But the feature works just like the browser extension did, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google product manager Kayce Hawkins: Visit a web page, highlight the text you want to create a link to, right click, and select “copy link to highlight.” A URL ending in a pound sign (#) is generated, which you can then share with others. When they open the link, they’ll be sent to the specific highlighted section instead of the beginning of the page.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rIW4W4nVsYNQKL1impKBHfGva5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22451590/keyword_highlight.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RmLbjN"&gt;An example of what the end result looked like using the browser extension can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288970/sony-ps5-playstation-5-announcement-analysis-graphics-games#GNaFeX:~:text=And%20that%E2%80%99s%20completely%20fine.%20Sony%E2%80%99s%20presentation,the%20PS5%20to%20be%20any%20different."&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt; (but only in Chrome and Edge browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jzpT"&gt;Google said the “copy link to highlight” feature is already available on desktop and Android devices for some users. The feature is “coming soon” to iOS, the company added. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has reportedly canceled its Lord of the Rings MMO game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/me-JBnz9kQj6mucoUGuDlYy9IXw=/65x0:761x464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143386/DOiAi2WUEAE3A1Y.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkE29Z"&gt;Amazon Game Studios has canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online role-playing game, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/amazon-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-two-years-ago?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688736/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-athlon-games-leyou-free-to-play-tolkien"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt; with Leyou-owned Athlon Games back in 2019, and planned it to be a free-to-play game for PC and consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsMYkR"&gt;The game was to be set “at a time long before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, exploring lands, people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe,” according to an announcement from Athlon at the time. But &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-14-leyou-shareholders-approve-tencent-takeover"&gt;Leyou was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Tencent Holdings in December, and contract negotiations between Amazon and Tencent later fell apart, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OkiJOG"&gt;Amazon did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;that it was “unable to secure terms to proceed” with the game. “We love the Lord of the Rings IP, and are disappointed that we won’t be bringing this game to customers,” the spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NWInE"&gt;Since its launch in 2014, Amazon Game Studios has yet to release a successful video game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;canceling some&lt;/a&gt; previously announced games and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;delaying others&lt;/a&gt;. Its video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 got such bad reviews that the game was pulled&lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt; from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the games studio had internal problems, including a culture that didn’t provide equal opportunities to men and women, and an in-house game engine that was “painfully slow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuRF67"&gt;But Amazon’s incoming CEO Andy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;Jassy said in response&lt;/a&gt; that he’s committed to the video games division, which launched under outgoing CEO and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; later this year. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most,” Jassy said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA reschedules Ingenuity helicopter’s first flight on Mars for Monday </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDyRwtaZBWhzgcl2A7zVACIXDi0=/300x0:3876x2384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143214/ingenuity2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An artists’ rendering of the Ingenuity and its parent rover Perseverance | NASA/JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;NASA has rescheduled the first flight of its Ingenuity Mars helicopter to April 19th at 3:30AM ET, the&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-attempt-first-controlled-flight-on-mars-as-soon-as-monday"&gt; agency announced&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY26kL"&gt;The four-pound helicopter that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Mars on February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; has seen its first flight delayed a few times. It touched the surface of Mars on April 4th, and has been undergoing tests and checkouts. It survived its first night alone on Mars’ frigid surface, passing a first test of its independence from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijL8wR"&gt;The craft was scheduled to take flight April 11th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;last weekend NASA said&lt;/a&gt; data from a high-speed rotor test showed the test sequence ended early, as Ingenuity’s computer tried to switch from pre-flight to flight mode The date was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;pushed back again&lt;/a&gt; after Ingenuity experienced a minor software glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS99Vh"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/290/work-progresses-toward-ingenuity-s-first-flight-on-mars/"&gt;decided to modify and reinstall&lt;/a&gt; Ingenuity’s flight control software, a process that took several days. NASA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1383221042504638464?s=20"&gt;tweeted Friday night&lt;/a&gt; that Ingenuity had completed a full-speed spin test and a decision about the next flight date was forthcoming. The little helicopter has been waiting on the surface of Mars’ Jezero Crater as NASA engineers tested and reinstalled the flight software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdiOyt"&gt;While Ingenuity is not the main focus of Perseverance’s mission on Mars— which is to look for signs of life and take dirt samples— the little helicopter could provide a leap forward in human exploration of Mars and other celestial bodies. Rovers like Perseverance can only move so far and don’t have details about what may lie ahead in their paths. But a small craft like Ingenuity can become like a scout, flying ahead to help the rover navigate Mars’ surface, and get to areas that other vehicles may not be able to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4axju"&gt;Once it does take off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;Ingenuity will climb&lt;/a&gt; about 10 feet (3 meters), then hover in place for 30 seconds before turning in midair and descending back to the surface. The camera on its underside will take 30 photos per second of the ground. A larger camera will face the horizon and snap photos while in flight, and at the same time Perseverance’s cameras will take pictures of Ingenuity flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhGyUm"&gt;If you’re up for an early morning Monday (or late night, depending where you are), you can watch the live stream of Ingenuity’s flight starting at 6:15AM ET/3:15AM PT, on NASA Television, the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/live"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and social media platforms, including &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/NASAJPL"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CPSC urges people with children at home to stop using Peloton Tread Plus treadmill ‘immediately’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peloton treadmill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UOQGEBiB-mCdYi35VFc16weimq4=/0x291:3000x2291/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142823/903922964.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2qHhQF"&gt;The Consumer Product Safety Commission on Saturday &lt;a href="https://cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Warns-Consumers-Stop-Using-the-Peloton-Tread+"&gt;issued a warning&lt;/a&gt; about Peloton Tread Plus treadmills, saying the machines pose “serious risks to children for abrasions, fractures, and death.” In a March blog post by CEO John Foley, the company &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;said it was aware&lt;/a&gt; that a child had died in an accident on the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9yzbK"&gt;The agency says it is aware of 39 incidents with the Tread Plus, including one death. “In light of multiple reports of children becoming entrapped, pinned, and pulled under the rear roller of the product, CPSC urges consumers with children at home to stop using the product immediately,” the CPSC bulletin states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLvtZt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onXNnlCYJ4Y&amp;amp;ab_channel=U.S.ConsumerProductSafetyCommission"&gt;The CPSC posted a video&lt;/a&gt; showing what could happen in a Tread Plus accident involving a child. It shows an unattended child being pulled under the treadmill and nearly crushed before he is able to escape (we’re linking to but not embedding the video because it’s disturbing to watch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFKtHQ"&gt;The agency issued a list of recommendations for users of the Tread Plus: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FjvQFG"&gt;Stop using the Peloton Tread Plus if there are small children or pets at home. Incidents suggest that children may be seriously injured while the Tread Plus is being used by an adult, not just when a child has unsupervised access to the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VPw7kq"&gt;If consumers must continue to use the product, CPSC urges consumers to use the product only in a locked room, to prevent access to children and pets while the treadmill is in use. Keep all objects, including exercise balls and other equipment, away from the treadmill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsxXYL"&gt;When not in use, unplug the Tread Plus and store the safety key away from the device and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VL63Sd"&gt;Separate from the incident where the child died, the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; In February that a three-year-old boy suffered a ”significant brain injury” in an incident with a Tread Plus treadmill. According to that report, the child had tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, as well as neck and other injuries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; at the time, saying the child from that incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJtk38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a statement Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it refuted what it called a “misleading, inaccurate bulletin” by the CPSC. According to Peloton, the company had sought to make a joint announcement with the CPSC about “the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqupFa"&gt;The company told the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it did not believe a recall of the Tread Plus was necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jwGbGi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388707/peloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dfeNFv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>During Indianapolis shooting, FedEx cell phone policy meant some family members couldn’t reach workers</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="US-crime-shooting" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJ84Uj2YU6cEk8h0mSkJKb9lH6I=/0x0:3900x2600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142655/1232347125.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CJzRMV"&gt;During a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis on Thursday, a company policy barring some employees from having their cell phones on them while working prevented family members from being able to contact workers inside the facility, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/16/us/shooting-fedex.html?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxyT7b"&gt;Authorities said the gunman, a former employee, fired into the warehouse killing eight people and wounding at least seven others, then fatally shot himself before police arrived. The incident began around 11PM Thursday and was over in a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVaTcf"&gt;Tami Campbell, whose husband works at the facility, said she didn’t know what had happened to him until he called her after his shift ended at 10AM Friday. “I called his phone a thousand times even though I knew he wouldn’t have it,” she told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. And according to the &lt;em&gt;Indianapolis Star&lt;/em&gt;, many family members had &lt;a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/2021/04/16/fedex-shooting-families-wait-employees-indianapolis/7250160002/"&gt;to wait overnight at a Holiday Inn Express&lt;/a&gt; to find out if their family members had been hurt or killed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMkwq0"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday, a FedEx spokesperson described the cell phone policy: “To support safety protocols and minimize potential distractions around package sortation equipment and dock operations, cell phone access within certain areas of FedEx Ground field operations is limited to authorized team members.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BeMI4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter having a partial outage Saturday morning</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kJplUrnXfZcq1dnySFKdV5B-A4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142133/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tAkjEl"&gt;It looks like problems on Twitter that began Friday night are persisting Saturday morning. People on the east coast of the US were reporting that while the page would load, they were unable to send tweets and DMs. As of 11 AM ET Saturday, the site was still experiencing issues for many users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rG6yl0"&gt;There’s no official word on how widespread the outage is, but Twitter said Saturday it was “fixing an issue” with its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ylVPU"&gt;Twitter Support posted a brief message Friday night that it was looking into the matter, and updated it Saturday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BV6AwV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We know that parts of Twitter still aren’t working for some of you. We’re fixing an issue with our servers to get things back to normal soon.

    <title>Peloton is fighting a recall request on its treadmill after a child died last month</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1AV52L"&gt;Peloton is resisting a request from the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to recall its Tread Plus treadmill, which was &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;involved with the death of a child last month&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/04/16/peloton-treadmill-injuries-death-cpsc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; is reporting tonight&lt;/a&gt;. At the time of the incident, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thestreet.com%2Finvesting%2Fus-consumer-agency-to-investigate-peloton-treadmill-death&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388707%2Fpeloton-fighting-recall-treadmill-child-death" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CPSC issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; that it was investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWjp6m"&gt;The agency is reportedly planning on issuing a consumer alert about the Tread Plus and may do so as early as Saturday, according to officials who spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Post. &lt;/em&gt;One official added that “this doesn’t happen with other treadmills.” The &lt;em&gt;Post’s&lt;/em&gt; sources tell the paper that the CPSC is aware of “‘dozens’ of incidents involving Peloton’s treadmills, some involving pets or exercise balls and many of them resulting in serious injuries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eLrE6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-18/peloton-ceo-says-accident-with-treadmill-led-to-death-of-child?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; this this past February the &lt;a href="https://www.saferproducts.gov/PublicSearch/Detail?ReportId=3054628"&gt;CPSC received a report&lt;/a&gt; that a three-year-old suffered a ”significant brain injury. He was found to have tread marks on his back matching the slats of the treadmill, neck injury, and petechiae on his face, presumably from occlusion of blood flow.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338287/peloton-ceo-accident-treadmill-child-death-safety"&gt;Peloton commented on the report&lt;/a&gt; that the child from that separate incident “is expected to fully recover.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96Et8p"&gt;Peloton CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://support.onepeloton.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058677091-A-Note-from-Peloton-CEO-John-Foley-about-Tread-"&gt;noted the death in an open letter&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, in which he reiterated the safety instructions for Peloton’s Tread Plus exercise treadmill, including “Keep children and pets away from Peloton exercise equipment at all times. Before you begin a workout, double check to make sure that the space around your Peloton exercise equipment is clear.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJcqd6"&gt;“While we are aware of only a small handful of incidents involving the Tread+ where children have been hurt,” Foley wrote, “each one is devastating to all of us at Peloton, and our hearts go out to the families involved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfDmdj"&gt;In a comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Peloton spokesperson writes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3WiKKJ"&gt;We are disappointed that the CPSC is mischaracterizing the situation. The Peloton Tread+ is safe for use at home when operated as directed and in accordance with our warnings and safety instructions. As a reminder, the Tread+ is not for children under 16 and children, pets, and objects need to be kept away from the Tread+ at all times. Peloton is 100% committed to the safety of our Members and we will always be open to working with the CPSC to implement impactful safety measures. When the Tread+ is not in use, Members should continue to follow the safety instructions by storing the safety key, which keeps the Tread+ from operating, away from the Tread+ and out of reach of children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xFbIVy"&gt;A spokesperson for the company told the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; that it “does not believe a recall is necessary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNV7Ee"&gt;&lt;a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-refutes-consumer-product-safety-commission-claims"&gt;Peloton said in a news release Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that it didn’t provide more information to the CPSC at the family’s request —”until it was compelled by subpoena to do so.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GiqrH"&gt;According to Peloton, the company “invited the CPSC to make a joint announcement about the danger of not following the warnings and safety instructions provided” with the Tread Plus, and CEO Foley asked to meet directly with the CPSC. The agency has, according to the company “unfairly characterized Peloton’s efforts to collaborate and to correct inaccuracies in CPSC’s press release as an attempt to delay. This could not be farther from the truth.” The CPSC, Peloton claims, was “unwilling to engage in any meaningful discussions with Peloton before issuing its inaccurate and misleading press release.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSNKYU"&gt;At issue is whether the accident was a result of a poorly designed product or improper use — Peloton says that not only should children be kept away from the treadmill, but that owners should “store it out of reach of children” when it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pW1w42"&gt;In October of 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2020/peloton-recalls-pr70p-bike-pedals-due-to-laceration-hazard-recall-alert"&gt;Peloton recalled&lt;/a&gt; the PR70P Clip-In Pedals, because they “can break unexpectedly during use, causing laceration injuries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKDTLb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th, 10:43AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds new statement from Peloton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge in Australia finds Google misled Android users about location data collection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bNd4ChOTFBb4tPlYnL2n_1bWB6U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142463/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2t5kR"&gt;A judge in Australia found Google misled users about personal location data the company collected via Android devices,  a violation of Australian law, the &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/australia-canberra-court-decisions-courts-laws-c6a7b75ac7cbfabc6ff2bc4069e3911c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6MLDP9"&gt;According to Federal Court Judge Thomas Thawley, the violations occurred between January 2017 and December 2018. Users creating a new Google account while setting up a new Android device were led to believe that the “Location History” setting was the only Google account setting that would determine if the company collected identifiable data about the user’s location. In fact, another Google account setting that was turned on by default — the “Web &amp;amp; App Activity” setting— allowed Google to collect and store personally identifiable location information when it was active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3esSHA"&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), the company’s consumer watchdog organization, said it is seeking penalties against Google, but did not specify an amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgReMx"&gt;“This is an important victory for consumers, especially anyone concerned about their privacy online, as the Court’s decision sends a strong message to Google and others that big businesses must not mislead their customers,” &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/google-misled-consumers-about-the-collection-and-use-of-location-data"&gt;ACCC chair Rod Sims said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoBLcb"&gt;Google did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday. But a spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt; that the company disagreed with the judge’s findings and was considering an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcvnVp"&gt;The company has been involved in legal action in Australia over the past several months. In February, the Australian government passed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;a law requiring Google&lt;/a&gt; and Facebook to pay media companies for news content distributed on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Project Zero will give a 30-day grace period before disclosing security issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGXuqwJ2psGhvZWemSYv_FpDek8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142286/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCh9NZ"&gt;Google’s Project Zero, a team of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5902061/google-project-zero-security-team"&gt;dedicated security engineers&lt;/a&gt; tasked with reducing the number of “zero day” vulnerabilities around the entire internet, says it will &lt;a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2021/04/policy-and-disclosure-2021-edition.html"&gt;give developers an extra 30 days&lt;/a&gt; before disclosing vulnerability issues, in order to give end-users time to patch their software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qumkuq"&gt;Developers will still have 90 days to fix bugs, but Project Zero will wait another 30 days before it discloses the details of the bug publicly. If a flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, a company will have seven days to issue a patch, and a three-day grace period if requested. But Google Project Zero will wait 30 days before it discloses technical details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3m88I"&gt;In 2020, Google announced a trial to allow developers 90 days to work on patch development and adoption, with the idea that if a dev wanted more time to allow users to install a patch, they’d ship the fixes early in the 90-day period. “In practice however, we &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; observe a significant shift in patch development timelines, and we continued to receive feedback from vendors that they were concerned about publicly releasing technical details about vulnerabilities and exploits before most users had installed the patch,” Project Zero’s Tim Willis wrote in the blog post. “In other words, the implied timeline for patch adoption wasn’t clearly understood.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRaC05"&gt;The goal of the 2021 update, Willis wrote, is to make the patch adoption timeline an explicit part of its vulnerability disclosure policy. “This 90+30 policy gives vendors more time than our current policy, as jumping straight to a 60+30 policy (or similar) would likely be too abrupt and disruptive,” he wrote. “Our preference is to choose a starting point that can be consistently met by most vendors, and then gradually lower both patch development and patch adoption timelines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Washington state lawmakers vote to phase out gasoline cars by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Traffic Jam" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xYgvohHa7yyBd88F_EHpQH4WAWg=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69142149/shutterstock_54135052.1419966774.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Traffic Jam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yojoZs"&gt;Washington state lawmakers have &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22450947/clean_cars_2030.pdf"&gt;passed a measure&lt;/a&gt; that would phase out the sale of gas-powered vehicles starting in 2030. The Clean Cars 2030 initiative passed Thursday as an amendment &lt;a href="http://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2021-22/Pdf/Amendments/Senate/1287-S2.E%20AMS%20ENGR%20S2584.E.pdf"&gt;to a bill&lt;/a&gt; that requires state utilities prepare for an electric-vehicle future. The bill now awaits Gov. Jay Inslee’s signature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G60dDl"&gt;That’s five years earlier than planned gas vehicle bans in California and Massachusetts, and the first ban on gas cars passed by legislators, rather than by an executive order. The bill passed Washington’s Senate by a vote of 25-23 and a vote of 54-43 in the House. The bill bans the sale, purchase, or registration of non-EVs from model year 2030 and later, and would include vehicles bought in another state and brought into Washington state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lafAK"&gt;The Clean Cars 2030 measure depends on the state approving a tax on vehicle miles traveled, which would help pay for new transportation infrastructure in the state, according to the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KT49H7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an order&lt;/a&gt; last September in that would ban the sale of new combustion-engine vehicles in the state starting in 2035, also part of a package of policy changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. That measure applies to new-vehicle sales in the state, and doesn’t bar Californians from owning gas-powered vehicles. Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker unveiled a plan in December to ban new gas-powered cars by 2035 as part of that state’s &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/doc/ma-2050-decarbonization-roadmap/download"&gt;2050 Decarbonization Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6R9AC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
