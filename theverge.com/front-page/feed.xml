    <title>Who decides what stays on the internet?</title>

  &lt;p&gt;Regulation expert Daphne Keller on where moderation goes after banning Trump&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="oWIJqn"&gt;The past week has seen the US government thrown into crisis after an unprecedented attack on the Capitol by a pro-Trump mob — all part of a messy attempt to overturn the election, egged on by President Donald Trump himself. Yesterday, the House of Representatives introduced an article of impeachment against Trump for incitement of insurrection. This is a turning point for the American experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNy8KY"&gt;Part of that turning point is the role of internet platform companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJwQeF"&gt;My guest today is Professor Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford’s Cyber Policy Center, and we’re talking about a big problem: how to moderate what happens on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNyjlD"&gt;In the aftermath of the attack on the Capitol, both Twitter and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22224860/parler-trump-deplatformed-capitol-raid-moderation-censorship-facebook-amazon-twitter"&gt;banned Trump&lt;/a&gt;, as did a host of smaller platforms. Other platforms like Stripe stopped processing donations to his website. Reddit banned the Donald Trump subreddit — the list goes on. And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;a smaller competitor to Twitter was effectively pushed off the internet&lt;/a&gt;, as Apple and Google removed it from their app stores, and Amazon kicked it off Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9BdSN"&gt;All of these actions were taken under dire circumstances — an attempted coup from a sitting president that left six people dead. But they are all part of a larger debate about content moderation across the internet that’s been heating up for over a year now, a debate that is extremely complicated and much more sophisticated than any of the people yelling about free speech and the First Amendment really give credit to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIij4b"&gt;Professor Keller has been on many sides of the content moderation system: before coming to Stanford, she was an associate general counsel at Google, where she was responsible for takedown requests relating to search results. She’s also published work on the messy interaction between the law and the terms of service agreements when it comes to free expression online. I really wanted her help understanding the frameworks content moderation decisions get made in, what limits these companies, and what other models we might use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqLaoU"&gt;Two notes: you’ll hear Professor Keller talk about “CDA 230” a lot — that’s a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;Section 230&lt;/a&gt;, the law that says platforms aren’t liable for what their users publish. And pay attention to how quickly the conversation turns to competition — the size and scale of the big platform companies are key parts of the moderation debate in ways that surprised even me. Okay, Daphne Keller, director of the Program on Platform Regulation at Stanford. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RihK5H"&gt;Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KlmjyO"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3501099770" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VQgGoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from our conversation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jvb8up"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2020 was a big inflection point in the conversation about content moderation. There was an endless amount of debate about Section 230, which is the law that says platforms aren’t liable for what their users post. Trump insisted that it be repealed, which is a bad idea for a variety of reasons. Interestingly to me, Joe Biden’s platform position is also that 230 be repealed, which is unique among Democrats. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfpMjB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That conversation really heated up over the last week: Trump incited a riot at the Capitol and got himself banned from Twitter and Facebook, among other platforms. For example, Stripe, a platform we don’t think about in the context of Twitter or Facebook, stopped processing payments from the Trump campaign website.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbdxQ0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following that, a competitor to Twitter called &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parler&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, which had very lax content moderation rules, became the center of attention. It got itself removed from both the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google app stores&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon Web Services pulled the plug on its web hosting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — effectively, the service was shut down by large tech companies that control distribution points. That’s a lot of different points in the tech stack. One of the things that I’m curious about is, it feels like we had a year of 230 debate, and now, a bunch of other people are showing up and saying, “What should content moderation be?” But there is actually a pretty sophisticated existing framework and debate in industry and in academia. Can you help me understand what the existing frameworks in the debate look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ve4dJ6"&gt;I actually think there’s a big gap between the debate in DC, the debate globally, and the debate among experts in academia. DC has been a circus, with lawmakers just making things up and throwing spaghetti at the wall. There were over 20 legislative proposals to change CDA 230 last year, and a lot of them were just theater. By contrast, globally, and especially in Europe, there’s work on a huge legislative package, the Digital Services Act. There’s a lot of attention where I think it should be placed on just the logistics of content moderation. How do you moderate that much speech at once? How do you define rules that even can be imposed on that much speech at once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwRwXo"&gt;The proposals in Europe include things like getting courts involved in deciding what speech is illegal, instead of putting that in the hands of private companies. Having processes so that when users have their speech taken down, they get notified, and they have an opportunity to respond and say if they think they’ve been falsely accused. And then, if what we’re talking about is the platforms’ own power to take things down, the European proposal and some of the US proposals, also involve things like making sure platforms are really as clear as they can be about what their rules are, telling users how the rules have been enforced, and letting users appeal those discretionary takedown decisions. And just trying to make it so that users understand what they’re getting, and ideally so that there is also enough competition that they can migrate somewhere else if they don’t like the rules that are being imposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbCX42"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The question about competition to me feels like it’s at the heart of a lot of the controversy, without ever being at the forefront. Over the weekend, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, AWS, Okta, and Twilio all decided they weren’t going to work with Parler anymore because it didn’t have the necessary content moderation standards. I think Amazon made public a letter they’d sent to Parler saying, “We’ve identified 98 instances where you should have moderated this harder, and you’re out of our terms of service. We’re not going to let incitement of violence happen through AWS.” If all of those companies can effectively take Parler off the internet, how can you have a rival company to Twitter with a different content moderation standard? Because it feels like if you want to start a service that has more lax moderation, you will run into AWS saying, “Well, here’s the floor.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oVwCZq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xGyCZ"&gt;This is why if you go deep enough in the internet’s technical stack, down from consumer-facing services like Facebook or Twitter, to really essential infrastructure, like your ISP, mobile carrier, or access providers, we have net neutrality rules — or we &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; net neutrality rules — saying those companies do have to be common carriers. They do have to provide their services to everyone. They can’t become discretionary censors or choose what ideas can flow on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdC3Id"&gt;Obviously, we have a big debate in this country about net neutrality, even at that very bottom layer. But the examples that you just listed show that we need to have the same conversation about anyone who might be seen as essential infrastructure. If Cloudflare, for example, is protecting a service from hacking, and when Cloudflare boots you off the service, you effectively can’t be on the internet anymore. We should talk about what the rules should be for Cloudflare. And in that case, their CEO, Matthew Prince, wrote a great op-ed, saying, “I shouldn’t have this power. We should be a democracy, and decide how this happens, and it shouldn’t be that random tech CEOs become the arbiters of what speech can flow on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0leG2S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we are talking about many different places in the stack, and I’ve always been a proponent of net neutrality at the ISP level, where it is very hard for most people to switch. There’s a lot of pricing games, and there’s not a lot of competition. It makes a lot of sense for neutrality to exist there. At the user-facing platform level, the very top of the stack, Twitter, I don’t know that I think Twitter neutrality makes any sense. Google is another great example. There’s an idea that search neutrality is a conceptual thing that you can introduce to Google. What is the spectrum of neutrality for a pipe? I’m not sure if search neutrality is even possible. It sounds great to say. I like saying it. Where do you think the gradations of that spectrum lie?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAmprf"&gt;For a service like Twitter or Facebook, if they were neutral, if they allowed every single thing to be posted, or even every single legal thing the First Amendment allows, they would be cesspools. They would be free speech mosh pits. And like real-world mosh pits, there’s some white guys who would like, it and everybody else would flee. That’s a problem — both because they would become far less useful as sites for civil discourse, but also because the advertisers would go away, the platforms would stop making money, and the audience would leave. They would be effectively useless if they had to carry everything. I think most people, realistically, do want them to kick out the Nazis. They do want them to weed out bullying, porn, pro-anorexia content, and just the tide of garbage that would otherwise inundate the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wNT9Kb"&gt;In the US, it’s conservatives who have been raising this question, but globally, people all across the political spectrum raise it. The question is: are the big platforms such de facto gatekeepers in controlling discourse and access to an audience that they ought to be subject to some other kind of rules? You hinted at it earlier. That’s kind of a competition question. There’s a nexus of competition and speech questions that we are not wrangling with well yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix promises at least one new movie every week in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZpnNfuRWqpWyALqFEbtjwf_HvQ0=/0x1:1619x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654755/zendaya_jdw.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DOMINIC MILLER/NETFLIX&amp;nbsp;© 2021&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VvNDgv"&gt;If you’re a Netflix subscriber, the company wants you to know there’s a lot of new movies coming. Netflix has 70 movies on its roster, more than Disney and Warner Bros. combined, according to the 2021 film slate the company released today. They include directorial debuts by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Halle Berry and the final installment in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134580/netflix-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before-release-stream-subscriber"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48RSlE"&gt;This may not end up being a complete list — Netflix is likely to acquire films throughout the year. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21545812/amc-theaters-financial-earnings-q3-bankruptcy-streaming-warner-bros-disney-regal"&gt;theatrical landscape remains shaky&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix is in a prime position to purchase films that studios like Universal or Paramount may sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3DJam"&gt;And Netflix was one of the few companies that surged as people stayed at home during a global pandemic. But with more competition in the streaming space, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215274/wonder-woman-1984-hamilton-hbo-max-disney-plus-numbers-streaming-success"&gt;needs more films and television shows&lt;/a&gt; to vie for people’s attention and wallets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lr2HIw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If people can’t go to the theaters, the studios will bring movies to people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TCT8W6"&gt;If people can’t go to the theaters, the studios will bring movies to people. That’s the philosophy behind WarnerMedia’s recent decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;simultaneously release movies&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max as they debut in theaters. Executives hope that some of those films, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21075594/dune-movie-trailer-denis-villeneuve-paul-atreides-timotee-chalamet-spice-sandworm-rebecca-ferguson"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will bring in HBO Max subscribers — and in doing so, take some of the attention away from Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5nrNm"&gt;Netflix has never released its slate of films all at once. But it hasn’t had this much competition before, either. WarnerMedia had its Warner Bros. and HBO Max announcement, and Disney held a massive investor day in December, firing off title after title coming to Disney Plus 2021 and 2022. Netflix, which is better at retaining subscribers, is reminding customers why they stick around: consistency and talent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuFe18"&gt;Below are the 70 films Netflix has announced for 2021. Some have previously announced release dates attached to the titles, while others are due out later in the year. Synopses for each can be found on Netflix’s site. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Condé Nast Entertainment wanted a major podcast network, but the producers say they got burned instead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A39ydv2WxBniXTLmacOq3Q22GQ4=/0x0:1593x1062/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654740/cne.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Condé Nast Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="isfBkU"&gt;Condé Nast &lt;a href="https://www.condenast.com/news/conde-nast-debuts-influence-network"&gt;had big plans&lt;/a&gt; for podcasts in 2020. It launched its new, eponymous podcast network and three initial shows — &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;In Vogue — &lt;/em&gt;this summer with an initial presentation at the NewFronts conference for media buyers&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But by the end of December, most of the people who created and worked on those new shows were no longer employed by the company. In &lt;a href="https://formerlycneaudio.medium.com/our-experience-making-podcasts-for-cond%C3%A9-nast-1cc802807891"&gt;a statement today&lt;/a&gt;, 11 former Condé Nast Entertainment (CNE) contract producers and editors allege the company mishandled their employment, outsourced their work to additional contractors, and, generally, bungled the network through mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wBa79"&gt;“We believe that Condé Nast could have a bright future in audio,” they write. “However, we don’t foresee success for this or any audio initiative that doesn’t respect its producers, editors, engineers, or the creative work they’re making.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wqOAoE"&gt;The producers and editors who built these shows were brought on as contractors, and often worked longer hours than scheduled, even pulling all-nighters, without benefits. They pitched, produced, and edited the shows, along with training magazine staffers on how to create audio content. They say Condé told them they couldn’t be brought on as full-time staff because of a hiring freeze. Only two people who worked on these shows were full-time employees, they say, and both of these employees have since turned in their resignation notices, making it unclear who will produce the network’s shows in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9YhMOq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The statement also details lessons they believe companies should learn from this situation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gm8UrK"&gt;Media companies have been increasingly interested in podcasts as the buzzing industry continues to offer opportunities for monetization. But many companies have found that making a great show requires expertise and a dedicated staff, and they don’t necessarily want to employ all those people themselves. That’s led Condé and other companies to seek help from partners that specialize in audio. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, for example, partnered with iHeartMedia to create its &lt;a href="https://blog.iheart.com/post/buzzfeed-news-and-iheartmedia-have-come-together-make-impeachment-today-podcast-trump"&gt;impeachment podcast&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeedpress/buzzfeed-iheartmedia-announce-original-podcast-news"&gt;a news program&lt;/a&gt; it launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYXmVb"&gt;When Condé’s contractors were hired, most were actually employed through a contracting company called Ettain instead of Condé itself, the former employees say. These producers and editors also say they were kept on short-term contracts and left in the dark about the future of the shows they helped create. &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt; team says they were “teased” with the possibility of a full-time staff position, only to later be told the show would instead be outsourced to an outside production company, Neon Hum, starting the next business day. They were offered the chance to move to the &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yz4peP"&gt;“They wanted [us] to train this production company, that they were outsourcing our show to, to take our jobs,” Caitlin Pierce, a senior producer for the show, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not that they didn’t think we could do it, or we’re doing a bad job, but they wanted us to move over all our processes to other people to make it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CZ7orM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One producer quit after being told she’d have to transfer teams&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PC92gS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;In Vogue &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Get Wired&lt;/em&gt; teams then began asking Condé for more transparency on the shows’ futures. Instead, the &lt;em&gt;In Vogue&lt;/em&gt; team says they received an automated, unpersonalized email from Ettain three days before their contract was set to expire saying that they’d no longer be employed and could start filing for unemployment on December 18th. The &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; team was offered an additional three-and-a-half-week contract, which was rescinded after they pushed back asking for an extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNvCu3"&gt;The sudden news for all these teams was especially shocking, they tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, because at &lt;em&gt;Get&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, for example, the team was already discussing 2021 plans. “Most of [December] was spent talking about plans and planning our production schedules for episodes and ideas that we had for season two,” says Ben Montoya, a former producer for &lt;em&gt;The Pitchfork Review&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;. He says the team planned “ambitious investigations and miniseries,” yet the company didn’t extend their contracts or negotiate with them about doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sE1Ay"&gt;The fate of these shows is unclear. A source close to the situation says advertisers bought inventory in &lt;em&gt;Get Wired&lt;/em&gt;, which was initially slated to premiere its second season in February. But this source also says Neon Hum hasn’t signed any new production deals with CNE going forward. (Neon Hum declined to comment for this story.) Meanwhile, Condé has seemingly shifted its podcasting plan to outsourcing production, possibly because of a change in leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUjkEB"&gt;Agnes Chu, a former Disney Plus executive, &lt;a href="https://www.condenast.com/news/agnes-chu-joins-conde-nast-as-cne-president"&gt;now leads CNE&lt;/a&gt; and took over for former CNE leader Oren Katzeff in July, after his old, problematic tweets &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/conde-nast-staffers-expose-entertainment-chiefs-old-tweets-about-mexicans-and-women"&gt;surfaced&lt;/a&gt;. The source close to Condé says Katzeff’s vision was to create a podcasting team in-house whereas Chu thinks the most effective way to create shows is outsourcing their production. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, CNE said it saw “much growth” in its audio business in 2020 and suggested it might look to rehire some people, which would be news to the producers and editors. “As we continue those series and develop new projects for this year’s slate, we hope to not only bring back some of our teams, but also build new creative partnerships with the best in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r2HHae"&gt;For the producers and editors, they see what happened as a result of big media companies looking to podcasting for new revenue and bringing in outside contractors to pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98HKOI"&gt;“I think it’s a great example of how the people who do the most work are always treated as if they’re disposable,” says Tarkor Zehn, a former&lt;em&gt; In Vogue &lt;/em&gt;associate producer. “It’s important for companies to realize that if you want to invest in the product, you have to invest in the people who make the work.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber is bringing its EV and public transit features to more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEKTexQRO5JLlyI7dD8MJuL7ZdQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654760/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZKTzX"&gt;Uber Green, the feature that allows customers to request rides in electric vehicles, is coming to more cities. After initially launching in 15 cities last September, the ride-hail company is bringing the feature to 1,400 additional cities and towns in North America. The new markets include Austin, Calgary, Houston, Miami, New York City, Tucson, Winnipeg, Washington, DC, and hundreds more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1X4Dc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;Uber claims that “100 percent” of rides&lt;/a&gt; on its platform will take place in electric vehicles by 2030 in the US, Canada, and Europe, and by 2040 for the rest of the world. But rather than pay drivers directly to trade their gas-burning vehicles for electric ones, the company will impose an extra fee on trips completed in an electric vehicle to incentivize drivers to make the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JE0eOl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For a dollar extra, riders can specifically request a hybrid or electric vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AvPZFl"&gt;For a dollar extra, riders can specifically request a hybrid or electric vehicle. Uber drivers who use hybrid or electric vehicles to pick up passengers will get an extra 50 cents per ride, while drivers using specifically battery-electric vehicles get another dollar on top of that — for a total of $1.50 extra per ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIneIu"&gt;Uber is also announcing new partnerships designed to get more drivers in less polluting vehicles. In Los Angeles, Uber drivers can rent hybrid or electric vehicles through Avis’ new EV rental program. Drivers in San Francisco can rent a vehicle with Ample technology and quickly swap their EV batteries in mere minutes, then return to the road fully charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ElmGi8"&gt;Uber has been linked to rising car congestion and increased pollution in cities. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7v4kd/uber-and-lyft-say-they-reduce-car-ownership-but-that-might-not-be-true"&gt;A new study from Carnegie Mellon&lt;/a&gt; found that the benefit from people ditching their cars to use ride-hailing services is negated by new vehicles added to the road by aspiring Uber and Lyft drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BG5cts"&gt;Lastly, Uber is expanding its public transportation feature to more cities. The company is launching its journey planning feature, which allows customers to swipe through bus and train schedules and plan their entire journey on public transportation, in Atlanta, Auckland, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Guadalajara, Philadelphia, Rome, Bangalore, Chennai, and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZDEzA"&gt;In addition, Uber is launching Uber Transit, which allows customers to plan multimodal trips including trains, buses, walking, and Uber rides in Mexico City and London. They are the third and fourth city to get Uber Transit, after Sydney and Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tplZx"&gt;For years, Uber has faced criticism for its &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/01/22/study-uber-and-lyft-are-responsible-for-u-s-transit-decline/"&gt;negative effects on public transportation&lt;/a&gt; in the US. Declining bus and subway ridership has been pegged to the rise of Uber’s popularity in dozens of cities. The company hopes to blunt that criticism by giving transit equal footing in its app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos introduces $69 battery replacement kit for its Move wireless speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9XGXhuLrqGUFHmtsdIB7kO_bl4=/72x0:1968x1264/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654741/sonoskit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f8o9q4"&gt;Sonos will help customers get more longevity out of its $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871409/sonos-move-wireless-bluetooth-speaker-review-alexa-google-assistant-wifi-price-specs-sound-quality"&gt;Sonos Move wireless speaker&lt;/a&gt; by offering a new battery replacement kit. The Move is Sonos’ first battery-powered speaker, whereas the company’s other products all plug into the wall. The kit costs $69 and includes the battery, a couple tools that help remove the old one, and a pair of replacement screws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in3OLa"&gt;“The new replacement battery kit was designed so customers can continue to enjoy extended battery life for their speaker even after years of use, without needing to replace the speaker altogether,” Sonos says. The company has previously mentioned that the Move’s battery can be swapped out, but it hasn’t offered the standalone battery until now. You can order it from the Sonos website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_KayO3-sJlEUXj7X-F5paCPoizY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208412/dseifert_190915_3647_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Move’s battery is estimated to last around 900 charge cycles (approximately three years).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzBWXI"&gt;Considering how little comes with the kit, replacing the Move’s battery doesn’t seem like that daunting of a task. You can purchase the battery replacement kit in either black or white to match the color of whichever Move you own. As for what to do with the old battery, your best bet is taking it to a local e-waste recycling facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQLw9j"&gt;Fresh out of the box, the Sonos Move is estimated to reach around 11 hours of continuous music playback. And the company has said the factory-installed battery should last for around 900 charge cycles (or roughly three years). But if you eventually notice the battery life getting shorter and shorter, you’ve now got an option for restoring full capacity. That’s an option that a lot of wireless speakers just don’t give you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CES Day 1: TCL takes its shot and Intel hunkers down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0niGOAeGhMkknE1uM082mZuo2O8=/0x1:2084x1390/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654362/TCL8K.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dqRelE"&gt;One of the things that usually happens at CES in Las Vegas is you get a sense that one company or another is really going hard. A few years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/6/16858000/google-assistant-ces-2018-ces-booth"&gt;Google started throwing unseemly amounts of money at an outdoor CES installation&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to show that the Google Assistant was ready to dominate the smart home. It was an acceleration of a trend in the smart home: a battle with Alexa to form an ecosystem. Standing outside the convention center in 2018, that trend loomed large both metaphorically and physically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40Lv8K"&gt;Now that CES is online-only, it’s a little harder for companies to puff their chests out and declare that they (or their products) have hit the big time. One company seemed to be doing its very best to try, though: TCL. And another company, Intel, is trying to drum up excitement for its processors even as we’re still goggle-eyed at the performance Apple achieved on its own chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8KbF5"&gt;I’ll have some thoughts on both TCL and Intel below, then a roundup of the rest of the biggest news from the first day of CES (including LG’s newer, brighter OLED TVs). Before that, though I’ve got a couple pieces of housekeeping. First, it’s time for the yearly requirement for this newsletter to point you to our &lt;a href="https://www.voxmedia.com/legal/privacy-notice"&gt;privacy notice&lt;/a&gt;, which I’m told has no major changes this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="dfhY2J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9028921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELlrdk"&gt;Second, we have a new newsletter! &lt;strong&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/strong&gt; is a weekly email rounding up some of the best deals on gadgets our commerce team has found. You &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;can subscribe here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="upd0Jg"&gt;TCL&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="J7QwcQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers might be most familiar with TCL thanks to its well-received TVs, which provide good quality for good prices. They regularly top our recommended lists because of that value. Last year TCL said it would be trying harder to establish its brand in the US phone market, but it didn’t really take. This year, the company has pulled out all the stops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmfjhP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224277/tcl-tv-xl-collection-8k-6-series-od-zero-announced-ces-2021"&gt;TCL announced the XL Collection line of TVs, vowing to take 8K mainstream this year&lt;/a&gt;. TCL has that reputation for value, but it what it &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; wants is to be considered a tech innovator — in the same class as Sony, Samsung, and LG. As Chris Welch notes, the company went so far as to publish a “prickly” blog post that touted its early adoption of Mini LED technology. It also took a shot at OLED TV technology, which is functionally equivalent to taking a shot at LG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ix4uCV"&gt;TCL is also trying to get you to associate it with other categories of products. It is readying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221389/tcl-wearable-display-glasses-moveaudio-s600-pet-tracker-ces"&gt;Wearable Display glasses for launch, new wireless buds, a pet tracker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219269/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-color-display-ereader"&gt;TCL NXTPAPER, a cross between a tablet and an e-reader&lt;/a&gt;. That last gadget has an interesting LCD screen that behaves a bit more like e-paper yet provides full color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1ejzQ"&gt;TCL’s phone announcements today included &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;two low-end 5G phones with the promise of more to come&lt;/a&gt;. When I saw that, I joked that “TCL” stands for “Tryin’ to Copy LG.” But the more I think about it, the more I think it’s not a joke. When it comes to phones, TCL is in fact trying to occupy the space LG used to take up. It has 5G phones ready to go and wants to be the brand carriers turn to when they want something less expensive than Samsung and Apple to sell to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcY2jt"&gt;TCL is flooding the zone with inexpensive smartphones this year, part of its overall push to gain more brand recognition in the US. So it’s not about copying LG after all — it’s about supplanting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rNr0G"&gt;Why should TCL’s push matter to you? In a word: competition. Even if you don’t buy a TCL gadget this year, it’s worth watching to see if the pressure it’s trying to bring to bear will have any impact. Or if, like so many things at CES, it’s all for show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FllMUL"&gt;Intel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RxZTyD"&gt;Intel is another company that tried to tell a big story about big changes this year. Intel has tried to use CES as a launch point to bolster its brand more than once. The most notable recent example would be 2018, when its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/9/16867298/intel-keynote-ces-2018-brian-krzanich-behind-the-scenes-show-meltdown-spectre"&gt;flamboyant keynote happened immediately after a series of very bad security problems for its chips&lt;/a&gt;. The whole issue cast a shadow over the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCMmHY"&gt;No security problems this year, but there’s still a shadow. This time it’s being cast by Apple, which recently introduced the truly superb M1 Arm-based chip on its laptops and gave Intel the boot in the process. Now I usually dislike the way these chip battles are sometimes set up because it’s too reductive: the PC market is vast and multifaceted. But Apple’s chips are such a big deal that there’s really no way to think about Intel and PCs without reference to how the company suddenly has a competitor that is producing systems vastly more efficient than Intel can manage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMElSm"&gt;It’s not reasonable to expect Intel to have a full response to the M1 already, but it turns out the company does plan on introducing something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;later this year that could be competitive in the form of its 12th Gen chips, dubbed Alder Lake&lt;/a&gt;. I have no idea if Intel can come anywhere close to the performance per watt Apple has achieved, but I do like that Intel is pushing to experiment with the the overall package of high-performance and high-efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="I0mRHY"&gt;But what’s notable is Intel’s scope here, with plans for hybrid chips that will scale far beyond simple mobile devices. The timing is particularly apt: the Alder Lake chips represent Intel’s closest product to Arm-based chips that are built like the game-changing M1 processors that Apple introduced in November. The fact that Intel is looking to scale its hybrid chips across its lineup could indicate that the company is looking to emulate Apple’s Arm success with its own technology going forward — an intriguing idea, particularly as Intel’s more traditional chip strategies continue to face delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaE28"&gt;The knock on Intel is that it can’t seem to get it together and transition its chips down to the 10nm and 7nm processes that power so much of the competition. That knock is well deserved, but it too is reductive in some ways. Even under the constraints of 14nm, Intel does have a few things coming that could power some pretty great devices this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1255838446"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225541/intel-processor-11th-gen-ces-2021-chips-specs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel’s new Core i9-11900K flagship processor will arrive in early 2021 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qclnM8"&gt;Despite the 11th Gen moniker, though, the new Rocket Lake-S chips are still technically 14nm chips — they don’t use the 10nm process. However, they do feature Intel’s Cypress Cove cores, which bring over the 10nm core design back to 14nm, allowing for faster speeds along with Intel’s faster Xe integrated graphics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1255837745"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intel’s latest 11th Gen H-series chips promise the fastest ultraportable gaming laptops yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IKlQHh"&gt;So while the new 35W H-series chips won’t be the processors found in the beefiest and best gaming laptops money can buy, they will offer some pretty impressive performance — meaning smaller or lighter laptops could start punching above their weight class, even with smaller core counts and less thermal headroom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because the design here still looks stale compared to the Surface Pro X. Which makes me wonder what will come first: an Intel chip in a Surface Pro X, an Arm-based chip with powerful performance in the Surface Pro X, or the heat death of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGihnb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22221393/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-convertible-laptop-price-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable has a 12-inch screen that’s, well, detachable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It’s a dead-ahead ThinkPad take on the Surface Pro and in some ways it’s what I wish Microsoft would do. Slightly updated design that still feels classically “ThinkPad” with some very utilitarian benefits (MIL-SPEC 810G for durability), but sadly not enough ports. Excited to see this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1255857053"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;┏ &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224455/hp-elite-folio-announced-arm-convertible-laptop-specs-ces-2021"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HP announces Snapdragon-powered Elite Folio convertible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Unique form factor and checks a lot of spec boxes. I just wish I could trust that Windows on Arm will be good enough this year to recommend to most people. Some people will get huge benefit out of this, though, as long as they know what they’re getting into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jrfDrS"&gt;The processor is Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2, and there’s also LTE and 5G connectivity through the X20 and X55 modems. The Folio can be configured with up to 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. There are two USB-C 3.2 ports and a headphone jack. HP is claiming up to 24.5 hours of battery life when watching locally stored video files, but we’ll have to see for ourselves how that plays out in more realistic workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0W1onf"&gt;So instead of building yet another flap, the garage door opener company set out to build an entire door of its own — with a doggie portal that would completely seal and lock when it closes. Preferably, it’d be a pet door you wouldn’t even know was there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qJmHWG"&gt;The original Aware motion-sensing system detects how Wi-Fi signals bounce around your house between routers in a mesh system. Movement naturally interferes with those signals, allowing the routers to act as a motion-sensing setup without the need for any additional hardware. ... Now, Linksys is adding support to leverage other internet-connected smart home products — like speakers, smart switches, and thermostats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The “bright room” thing is second only to high prices when it comes to things that make me reticent about OLED (burn-in is third, but it’s a distant third).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="apBLxu"&gt;Brightness has remained a winning factor for LCD TVs over many years; despite perfect blacks and amazing viewing angles, sometimes an OLED set just won’t get the job done if you stick it in an ultra-bright room. But LG says the Evo panel found in its new G1 series — succeeding 2020’s GX lineup — can crank higher than any of its previous OLED TVs for improved luminosity and HDR. LG likens this achievement to past OLED milestones like 4K HDR and the introduction of 8K.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Yelp lets you tattle on places that don’t enforce masks and social distancing</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dlXhPy"&gt;Yelp is adding a new option that lets customers provide feedback on whether a business is enforcing COVID-19 safety guidelines, the company announced today. Initially, users will be able to report whether staff at a business are wearing masks, and whether they’re enforcing proper social distancing guidelines. The aim is to “instill confidence in consumers to continue supporting local businesses,” Yelp says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjPQtr"&gt;You’ll be able to provide feedback on a business’ safety measures via its page on Yelp, either through survey questions or by tapping the “Edit” icon in the top-right of a page’s COVID-19 updates section. The listing will display either a green check mark or an orange question mark next to the listed safety measures, depending on what a majority of users report. The icons shown will be based on an overall consensus from visitors, and only count responses over the last 28 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AvyoZE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM teases new Chevy Bolt with Super Cruise, sets release date for February</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n--T2cok-o5IFVKcPvQzhBM6C08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654294/akrales_170313_1481_A_0019.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZwTgQ"&gt;GM says that two new versions of the Chevy Bolt are set to be unveiled in February 2021. The company has released a new teaser that highlights a new feature coming to the electric vehicles: GM’s well-regarded advanced driver assist system, Super Cruise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2v3Q1"&gt;GM is planning to release a refreshed Chevy Bolt, which was first released in 2017, as well as a Bolt Electric Utility Vehicle, or EUV. The teaser was timed to coincide with GM CEO Mary Barra’s keynote speech at the 2021 Consumer Electronics Show — which is being held virtually this year because of the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dGXTq1"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Chevrolet Bolt teaser|100186" data-volume-uuid="6e31a291d" data-volume-id="100186" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-620" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AK25Ak"&gt;The refreshed Bolt will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21401302/gm-chevy-bolt-tease-image-electric-ev"&gt;feature a sportier look&lt;/a&gt;, new seats, adaptive cruise control, and a few other minor changes. GM bumped up the range &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828821/2020-chevy-bolt-259-miles-battery-upgrade"&gt;in this past year’s version of the Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, from 238 miles to 259 miles, but no further increase is expected in the refresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kDjsOz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A major change will be the inclusion of Super Cruise&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t50n7x"&gt;The Bolt EUV (not an acronym we expect to catch on, but go off I guess) will have a longer wheelbase than the regular Bolt and should appeal to customers looking for a more crossover SUV look than hatchback. The EUV looks longer than the regular Bolt but that much taller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHzvcR"&gt;A major change will be the inclusion of Super Cruise, GM’s “hands free” advanced driver assist system. When it first debuted in 2017, Super Cruise drew immediate comparisons to Tesla’s Autopilot system. It uses cameras, radar, and LIDAR mapping data, combined with a robust driver monitoring system, to take a lot of stress out of highway driving. When engaged, drivers can take their feet off the pedals and hands off the steering wheel, and the car generally drives itself on divided highways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVPgcc"&gt;The two new Bolts are the latest GM vehicles to get Super Cruise, and the first from Chevrolet. Super Cruise is also available in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/3/16709660/cadillac-ct6-super-cruise-self-driving-holidays"&gt;2018 Cadillac CT6&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18515802/cadillac-super-cruise-ct5-ny-auto-show-2019"&gt;2021 Cadillac CT5 and CT4&lt;/a&gt;, the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024331/cadillac-escalade-2021-38-inch-curved-oled-screen"&gt; 2021 Cadillac Escalade&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGYyOc"&gt;Both the Bolt EV and Bolt EUV will be built on GM’s BEV2 platform, which is distinct from the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439374/gm-unveils-ultium-drive-family-of-electric-motors"&gt;“Ultium” battery pack&lt;/a&gt; announced in early 2020. The recently unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt; and the GMC Hummer EV will be the first vehicles to be built on this new electric architecture. As such, the Bolt EV and EUV were expected to go into production at the end of 2020 but were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203020/refreshed-chevy-bolt-delay-coronavirus-covid-19"&gt;delayed until this year&lt;/a&gt; due to the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NoI1Z2"&gt;The new Bolts can’t come quick enough, given the controversy surrounding the current versions of the EV. GM was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22135764/chevy-bolt-batteries-catching-fire-class-action-lawsuit"&gt;slapped with a class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging that the Chevy Bolt’s battery is “prone to burst into flames.” The lawsuit comes on the heels of GM announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;recalling 68,000 Bolts&lt;/a&gt; over a malfunctioning battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNZMcS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s Rollable phone is real and launching in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="LG’s Rollable phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2JsLPB2aTOESeBVp2QgQB7R4hU=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654276/lgrollable.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BYZPz4"&gt;LG &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;teased its Rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; yesterday at the Consumer Electronics Show, and now the company is confirming it’s a real product that will be available in 2021. The LG Rollable has what the company calls a “unique resizable screen” that extends from a phone into a small tablet display. The screen slides in and out of place to provide a bigger screen area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2UBIR"&gt;“Our management wanted to show that it is a real product, as there were many rumors around the rollable phone,” says an LG spokesperson in a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/CES-2021/LG-to-release-world-s-first-rollable-smartphone-developed-with-BOE"&gt;statement to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “As it is released at CES 2021, I can tell that it will be launched this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xg1zXf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;also reports that LG is working with China’s BOE Technology Group on the rollable screen technology. LG has not yet confirmed what display tech the Rollable is using, or any details on the different display sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Wing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fr2MA9"&gt;LG first started working on the Rollable as part of the company’s “Explorer Project” experiments. The company has used this project to previously launch its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing smartphone&lt;/a&gt;, with a rotating design and two OLED displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2S3qG"&gt;Now that LG has branded its new LG Rollable phone and confirmed it’s coming to market this year, we’ll likely see a race among phone manufacturers to roll this rollable screen technology out. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/3/5/21165069/tcl-foldable-trifold-phone-hands-on-rollable-concept-prototype-display-tablet"&gt;TCL also demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; future phone concepts back in March, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571056/oppo-x-2021-rolling-phone-ar-glass-concept-inno-day-2020"&gt;Oppo teased&lt;/a&gt; a concept device with an expandable OLED display late last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bans 70,000 QAnon accounts as conservatives report lost followers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2xU6wTn1zVBIeOLTcTYYqyNBSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68654209/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZSGoAu"&gt;Twitter has permanently suspended over 70,000 accounts since Friday in an attempt to clamp down on QAnon-fueled conspiracies on its service, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/protecting%E2%80%94the-conversation-following-the-riots-in-washington%E2%80%94.html"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. It says the accounts were “engaged in sharing harmful QAnon-associated content at scale and were primarily dedicated to the propagation of this conspiracy theory across the service.” At the same time, prominent conservative voices on Twitter complained about lost followers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnkPE8"&gt;Twitter began suspending accounts on Friday afternoon, two days after President Trump incited a mob that broke into the US Capitol building. Twitter categorized the suspensions as part of an attempt to “protect the conversation on [its] service from attempts to incite violence, organize attacks, and share deliberately misleading information about the election outcome.” &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/11/trump-twitter-ban/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that there were a large amount of QAnon followers among last week’s rioters, including the self-described “QAnon Shaman” photographed shirtless inside the Capitol wearing horns and a fur hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vHOlKp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company banned 7,000 QAnon-related accounts last July&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QN5m0r"&gt;Twitter’s suspension of QAnon accounts coincided with some prominent GOP members complaining about lost followers — namely, those supporting false claims of a stolen election. Republican representative &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1348079725353324544"&gt;Matt Gaetz complained&lt;/a&gt; of having lost tens of thousands of followers, a claim which is supported by data from &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/mattgaetz"&gt;Social Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Similar drops were observed for figures like &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/tedcruz"&gt;Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/hawleymo"&gt;Josh Hawley&lt;/a&gt;, and elected &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/03/us/politics/qanon-candidates-marjorie-taylor-greene.html"&gt;QAnon supporter&lt;/a&gt; from Georgia &lt;a href="https://socialblade.com/twitter/user/mtgreenee"&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene&lt;/a&gt;. All had been regularly gaining followers prior to the QAnon purge that Twitter says began on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1X65A4V85FRlhVVX1Q6Q3SbuWa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229808/msedge_n0a6X0QrR1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marjorie Taylor Greene, Republican representative from Georgia, has lost tens of thousands of followers since Twitter started banning QAnon accounts on Friday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fnVcqR"&gt;The amount of Twitter accounts suspended is a marked escalation compared to previous crackdowns detailed by the social media company, and follows one of the most striking examples yet of the real-world impact of online misinformation. Last July, the company announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333570/twitter-crackdown-qanon-conspiracy-ban-search-trending"&gt;banned 7,000 accounts&lt;/a&gt; in relation to the QAnon conspiracy theory. Although its latest crackdown has banned tens of thousands of profiles, Twitter says that single individuals were operating “numerous” accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCMt9w"&gt;As well as suspending accounts directly, Twitter says it has applied restrictions on other accounts which have tweeted or retweeted “associated content.” It has reduced the visibility of these accounts across search, replies, and timelines, and will not recommend them to others on Twitter. It’s also asking other accounts suspected of spamming to verify their authenticity, which can cause them to temporarily disappear from follower counts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yR6vcq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
