    <title>Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti can deliver 60fps gameplay in more budget-friendly laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX 3050" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wOld_MheZWPN5E1ajT3BkxkQ9g=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267535/rtx3050lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9fA2Hn"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 30-series lineup of mobile graphics chips has two new members joining today: the GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and 3050. They sit beneath the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; in terms of specs and performance, with less video memory (4GB) and fewer dedicated Tensor AI and RT cores available to perform ray tracing and handle AI-enhanced effects like DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqPRdG"&gt;Despite this, Nvidia says that the RTX 3050 Ti is capable of going beyond 60fps in games like &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Outriders&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;— all with ray tracing settings on. That’s pretty good, considering it’ll show up in gaming laptop starting at $849. The RTX 3050 will appear in laptops starting at $799. We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407647/samsungs-galaxy-book-odyssey-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-gpu"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy Book Odyssey&lt;/a&gt; will feature these graphics chips, starting at $1,399.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxKSEq"&gt;There are caveats. To begin with, Nvidia’s benchmark measured this level of performance with graphics set to medium, with medium ray tracing settings enabled, and with DLSS on and set to quality mode. It’s entirely possible that many games set to high graphics settings (and minimal or no ray tracing) might also perform well with the RTX 3050 Ti, but this graphics chip seems best suited for people who don’t mind knocking down some quality settings to get smooth gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CFsQGwT4l-HpqqKAMsolTV_gi1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19814059/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;According to Nvidia, the 3050 Ti can run &lt;/em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;em&gt; at well above 60 frames per second if DLSS is on.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAxuvV"&gt;The RTX 3050 Ti serves as yet another flex of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/14/17854230/nvidia-rtx-2080-turing-architecture-specs-platform"&gt;Nvidia’s DLSS feature&lt;/a&gt; that, with the help of its AI cores, is able to run games faster than the hardware normally could. It does this in supported games by turning down the resolution, then using a trained AI model to enhance the picture quality on the fly without a perceptible (in most cases) difference in how the game looks. It promises big gains in performance with little in the way of disadvantages, unless you’re really dissecting pixels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sonst5"&gt;Again, this is a great argument in favor of these two GPUs, but it only works if your games have been patched to support DLSS. &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, for example, supports DLSS, but its performance without the feature turned on takes almost a 50 percent hit, running at about 35 frames per second at medium settings, according to Nvidia’s testing. That’s playable, but not particularly fluid, and it may be indicative of the kind of experience you might have when playing graphically intensive games that don’t support DLSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBdi9c"&gt;The performance charts that Nvidia shared with us only showed data on the RTX 3050 Ti’s performance, not the RTX 3050’s. Given that the RTX 3050 is a notch below the RTX 3050 Ti in terms of specs, you can probably expect performance to reflect that. Still, it should deliver good performance for the expected $799 starting price of laptops into which it will be built.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nvidia RTX 3050 Ti" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i-BRc6ttkVX8MRwJsoLr2fzm9SY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505314/rtx3050tiperf.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nvidia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the performance breakdown of the 3050 Ti in some games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qLFBom"&gt;It’s also important to remember that, like with all other RTX 30-series mobile graphics chips, OEMs are free to tweak the total graphics power (TGP) of each RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti in terms of wattage and clock speed to align with their design goals. The TGP range for these chips can be anywhere between 35W and 80W. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIfXUq"&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;it’s fair to expect less powerful variants in thinner laptops&lt;/a&gt;. Conversely, thicker models often allow graphics cards to reach their highest possible power levels. As a result, you may want to keep that in mind when you’re shopping for a gaming laptop equipped with one of these new chips.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s flagship Tiger Lake-H mobile chips are here to take on Ryzen 5000</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0o1TCYDaZNXYnI_9Ee6n04O8Lo8=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267536/intelcorei9_11900K_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ssqbhj"&gt;Intel has added five consumer processors and five commercial processors to its 11th Gen Core H-series generation (codenamed “Tiger Lake-H”). Both groups include three eight-core chips and two six-core chips. All of the parts are 35W, save the flagship Core i9-11980HK, which is clocked at 65W. You’ll see them in over 30 upcoming ultraportables (laptops 20mm or thinner) and over 80 workstations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGKur2"&gt;The company (unsurprisingly) says the new chips will provide significant performance improvements over their predecessors from the 10th Gen “Comet Lake” series. It claims they’ll provide a 19 percent “gen-on-gen multithreaded performance improvement.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQMS4R"&gt;On the gaming front, Intel says the Core i9-11980HK will deliver significantly better frame rates than its Comet Lake predecessor on titles including &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3, Far Cry New Dawn, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege. &lt;/em&gt;The company also took aim at its competitors. It claims the 11980HK also beats the rival AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX on these titles and that its Core i5-11400H (meant for thin and light laptops) will outperform the Ryzen 9 5900HS on some and come close to matching its performance on others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Adczrh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;19 percent “gen-on-gen multithreaded performance improvement”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PNNo36"&gt;Intel did not make battery life claims in its presentation. That’s a bit concerning because recent AMD-powered laptops have been excellent in that department for the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wok55l"&gt;In terms of more nitty-gritty specs, the chips will support up to 44 platform PCIe lanes, Thunderbolt 4 with up to 40Gbps bandwidth, discrete Intel Killer Wi-Fi 6E (Gig+), Optane H20, overclocking with Intel’s Speed Optimizer (on some SKUs), 20 PCIe Gen 4 lanes with RST-bootable RAID0, and turbo boost up to 5.0Ghz with Intel’s Turbo Boost Max Technology 3.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uAjd5b"&gt;The commercial chips will support Intel’s vPro platform, which includes a number of business-specific security features and management tools, including Intel’s Hardware Shield (which includes a new threat-detection technology that Intel says is “the industry’s first and only silicon-enabled AI threat detection”), Total Memory Encryption, and Active Management Technology. Intel says its Core i9-11950H will be up to 29 percent faster than its predecessor in product development, 12 percent faster in financial services work, and 29 percent faster in media and entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="n3iLCJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many eyes are on these new chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CNLBz6"&gt;Many eyes are on these new chips, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;AMD’s Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt; took the laptop market by storm when it was announced earlier this year. Its eight-core chips have shown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;significant performance gains&lt;/a&gt; over previous generations, particularly in multi-core workloads and efficiency. Meanwhile, Apple’s Arm-based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; has put up startlingly good performance numbers while maintaining incredible battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWPeDG"&gt;Intel is playing catch-up here, and the Tiger Lake-H chips we’ve gotten to try so far haven’t been astonishing. The lightweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310002/vaio-z-2021-laptop-review"&gt;Vaio Z&lt;/a&gt;, powered by the quad-core Core i7-11375H, yielded great results on single-core benchmarks but couldn’t hold a candle to Apple’s M1 Macbook Pro in multi-core tasks. On the gaming front, we’ve also tested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22385493/msi-stealth-15m-gaming-laptop-specs-performance-review"&gt;MSI’s Stealth 15M&lt;/a&gt; and Acer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22347032/acer-predator-triton-300-se-review-price-features-specs"&gt;Predator Triton 300 SE&lt;/a&gt; (both powered by the 11375H as well). The Stealth didn’t quite achieve the frame rates we’d expect from a laptop of its price (and couldn’t take full advantage of its QHD screen), and the Predator had disappointing battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5Er48"&gt;I’ll have more to say about these new CPUs when I’ve gotten to test them for myself — hopefully sooner rather than later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer claims its new Blade 15 is the ‘thinnest’ 15-inch RTX gaming laptop</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QUWkEMZwMgYYEpE0VDP9uFZhvL0=/0x1:3218x2146/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267557/razerblade15advancedmid2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The starting model is roughly one millimeter thinner than the previous generation.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2nDSFX"&gt;Razer has just announced new versions of its Blade 15 workhorse gaming laptop, complete with some of the biggest changes to the lineup in some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yyz6e"&gt;Like many other laptops announced today, the new Blade 15 Advanced features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;Intel’s 11th Gen H-series processors&lt;/a&gt; and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics chips, with up to a Core i9 11900H (2.5GHz base clock, 4.9GHz boost clock), an RTX 3080 GPU with 16GB of video memory (Razer declined to share the total graphics power ahead of publishing), and a 4K touchscreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKbdjU"&gt;The most welcome improvement might be the new fingerprint-resistant coating making its way to all of these new models. I can’t imagine that it’ll eliminate fingerprints altogether, but this should address one of the biggest annoyances with the prior models. The Windows Hello webcam is getting bumped up to 1080p resolution (from 720p), and Razer claims the trackpads have improved palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cg1VuV"&gt;For the new design, Razer managed to shave off a little more than a millimeter from the thickness of the Blade 15 Advanced, coming in at 15.8mm thick. Razer claims that it’s the smallest 15-inch gaming laptop with RTX graphics and is 17 percent smaller by dimensions compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt;. This size reduction applies only to the starting model that has the RTX 3060, though. Thinner might sound more appealing, but it isn’t usually better for gaming performance. Nvidia allows OEMs like Razer to choose the wattage and clock speed of the GPU based on their laptop designs, and generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;the thinner the laptop is, the worse it can be running games&lt;/a&gt; compared to thicker laptops that typically allow for bigger cooling systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTyuNS"&gt;The higher-specced options are thicker than this 15.8mm model, but that’s roughly the same thickness as the previous generation. The width and depth of these machines debuting today are also unchanged from the previous gen at 355 and 235mm (13.98 and 9.25 inches), respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JSfDKqUjLcrQ5hGoJSXDlRfsIEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504795/razerblade15advancedmid2021_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Blade 15 Advanced can be configured with an FHD, QHD, or 4K display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WHkNjI"&gt;The latest (and thinnest) Blade 15 Advanced starts at $2,299, and this model has a 240Hz QHD IPS panel with 2.5ms response time and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 gamut. It has an octa-core Intel Core i7-11800H processor, the RTX 3060 GPU with 8GB of video memory, and 16GB of DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz. A 1TB NVMe SSD that supports PCIe 4.0 for faster read / write and transfer speeds and a 80Wh battery come standard across all Advanced models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyJhmY"&gt;The selection of ports across the Advanced lineup is similar but not exactly the same as the models released earlier in 2021. The most notable exceptions are the two new Thunderbolt 4 ports. In addition, you’ll find an UHS-III SD card reader, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a headphone jack, and an HDMI 2.1 port. Aside from that, all new Blade 15 models support Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, 20V charging via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="gKwsm0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Razer Blade 15 Base review: losing its edge","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="4kOAoR"&gt;All of the Advanced models also support upgradeable storage and RAM. The starting model has only one M.2 slot because of its thin design, but all other new models have an additional M.2 slot for a total of up to 4TB of storage supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVwH9Q"&gt;Spending more will get you a better screen, processor, and GPU. Below you can see the specs of each option, as well as the most recent version of the prior Blade 15 Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Afmvr9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10492453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuAWei"&gt;All of these new Blade 15 Advanced machines will be available for preorder starting Monday, May 17th from Razer. They’ll go on sale and ship sometime in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI’s new laptops take aim at the 16-inch MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MSI GL66 Pulse half open on a table, with black and purple lights in the background. The screen displays the MSI dragon-shield logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGmi5wUXE_eYdApcfe79Phk4lwY=/0x0:9406x6271/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267582/Pulse_GL76_GL66_Scenario_Photo_5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the GL66 Pulse, which starts at $949.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: MSI&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUD2bY"&gt;MSI has announced a number of gaming and creator laptops that include Intel’s brand-new Tiger Lake H processors. The models will be available for purchase on May 16th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9cCiE"&gt;MSI is best known for its high-end gaming laptops, but the company has made a few attempts to diversify its portfolio over the past few years. The manufacturer made a play for deep-pocketed professionals with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418451/msi-summit-series-prestige-modern-announced-specs"&gt;Summit Series&lt;/a&gt; business line last year, and it also sells some lower-priced models tailored to content creators. The new Creator Z16 is its first attempt to enter the market of premium content-creation machines, targeting customers that MSI bluntly calls “MacBook Pro users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9zcTkk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Creator Z16 models start at $2,599&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7FyaV"&gt;There are two Creator Z16 models, with the base model priced at $2,599. Both come with a 120Hz 16:10 touch display with QHD+ resolution, which MSI says will cover 100 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut. The 16:10 aspect ratio may be a bonus for on-the-go designers and artists since it provides more vertical workspace than traditional 16:9 gaming laptops do. Inside, both models come with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 and 32GB of RAM. You can then select 1TB or 2TB of storage, and either a Core i7-11800H or a Core i9-11900H. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xorGrh"&gt;Those on a tighter budget may prefer the Creator M16, which is a lighter-weight version of the Z16. This model also includes a QHD+ display, but its chips max out at a GeForce RTX 3050 Ti and a Core i7. Pricing on that one is still to be announced. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056429/msis-creator-17-laptop-mini-led-1000-nits-hdr-4k"&gt;Creator 17&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a Mini LED display, has also been bumped up to the new chips (up to a Core i9 and a GeForce RTX 3080). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GF76 Katana and GF66 Katana, closed, stacked on top of each other, seen from above, in black and white colors respectively. Swords, katanas, and other weapons surround them on the floor." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lHMHjAn0Lt63Yx-13Qz1YuFlEA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504588/Katana_GF76_GF66_Scenario_Photo_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: MSI&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are the GF76 Katana and GF66 Katana, starting at $1,149 and $999, respectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HNHBKA"&gt;Aside from the specs, MSI emphasized that its build quality has improved. Representatives told me the Creator Z16 would display the company’s “best build quality ever.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApkkwJ"&gt;Alongside its creator models, MSI has specced up a number of its premium gaming rigs. The high-end GE76 and GE66 Raider now have 11th Gen Intel processors up to a Core i9 (paired with graphics up to an RTX 3080) and a 240Hz QHD screen option, as do the GS76 and GS66 Stealth. The GP76 and GP66 Leopard, as well as the GL76 and GL66 Pulse (which are sequels to the GL Leopard line), also have the new chips up to a Core i7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNnnGz"&gt;Closer to the budget end of the market, MSI has released two new entry-level gaming lines, dubbed “Katana” and “Sword.” The company says they feature a brand-new design inspired by the work of Japanese illustrator Tsuyoshi Nagano. (Sword models are white and Katana models are black; the Sword can also currently only be configured with 8GB of RAM while all Katana models have 16GB.) Katana models start at $999, and Sword models start at $1,099.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s ZBook Studio G8 is a serious laptop that isn’t afraid to show its fun side</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-dzMLtTm29ZkqBDSZqWWtr06TM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267534/zbookstudiog8lead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An elegant-looking work/gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lCaKYV"&gt;HP’s ZBook workstations are designed primarily with creators and enterprise users in mind. Two of the three new ZBook G8 laptops announced today — the ZBook Fury G8 and the Power G8 — should serve those crowds nicely. But the 15.6-inch Studio G8 is the oddball of the group for a very obvious reason, and I love it so much. It’s a work laptop, yet it has an RGB-backlit keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vD95hS"&gt;It has this colorful keyboard for the reason you might expect: HP apparently hopes you might also want to do some gaming on it. The laptop can be configured with some seriously high-end components, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;Intel’s newly-announced 11th Gen H-series Core i7 and Core i9&lt;/a&gt; processors, going up to a Core i9-11950H vPro (2.6GHz base clock, 5GHz boost clock) processor. Impressively, it can house all of that power in a chassis that weighs less than four pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="HP ZBook Studio G8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EDmdOf55Wa3UgsSNKWSaUKpyMdw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22504752/zbookstudiog8keys.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The colors can be customized in HP’s Omen gaming hub software.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yuaHZI"&gt;The Studio G8 should shine in the graphics department as well, because it’s configurable with the variant of the Nvidia RTX 3080 that can contain up to 16GB of video memory, currently the most powerful mobile GPU available. Though if you’re concerned more with creative workflows than gaming, opting for the Nvidia RTX A5000 GPU intended for professionals might be the smarter choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DHCtZ"&gt;The ZBook Studio G8 ships with a 1080p IPS display by default, but it can be upgraded to a 4K IPS screen with a 120Hz refresh rate that has 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color gamut; you can also opt for a 4K OLED touchscreen. One other unexpected gaming-focused feature this laptop has is an HDMI 2.1 port, which allows certain configurations of the Studio G8 to display 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second on external monitors or TVs that allow it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1h1TT"&gt;Would I recommend the ZBook Studio G8 over any newer gaming laptops? Likely not, but it’s tough to say, since we don’t know the price. HP says it plans to release this particular model in July and will share the price closer to that time. The company also says that certain configurations with consumer-grade RTX 30-series GPUs may launch in the second half of 2021. HP’s other ZBook G8 models, the ZBook Power G8 and ZBook Fury G8, will launch this summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s new XPS 15 and XPS 17 get upgraded with Intel’s long-awaited 11th Gen H-series chips</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HdMAzt-qC_S2OwUWD1_cHKN_dP0=/80x0:2480x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267537/dell_xps_17_familiar.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell’s new (familiar looking) XPS 17 for 2021 | Image: Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5avoCD"&gt;Intel has just announced its new 11th Gen processors for more powerful laptops, and Dell is ready with refreshed versions of its XPS 15 and XPS 17 laptops that add the new chips, along with Nvidia’s latest RTX 30-series laptop GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4H2Lho"&gt;The new models are virtually the same on the outside as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257006/dell-xps-17-15-redesign-specs-features-update-2020"&gt;the more substantial 2020 refresh&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the reintroduction of the largest 17-inch size and a redesign for the 15-inch model to better match Dell’s popular XPS 13 design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aab8aV"&gt;But both laptops now offer improved specs, featuring Intel’s 11th Gen Tiger Lake H-series chips, bringing the company’s 10nm process to Dell’s more powerful laptops. Both the XPS 15 and XPS 17 can now be configured with the six-core i5-11400H or eight-core i7-11800H and i9-11900H option. The XPS 17 also adds an additional i9-11980HK option, offering eight cores and a maximum 5.0GHz clock speed for what Dell says is the “most powerful XPS laptop ever.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKMnG499ck2maZSYsezq_whmjhY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505168/dell_xps_15_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dell’s 2021 XPS 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pz93iX"&gt;There are also new, more powerful GPU options. The XPS 15 can now be configured with either Nvidia’s RTX 3050 or RTX 3050 Ti (with 45W of power), while the XPS 17 offers a beefier 60W RTX 3050 or a 70W RTX 3060 GPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9A8yg"&gt;Both computers still can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM, with options for either 4K (3840x2400) or FHD (1920 x 1200) panels, although the XPS 15 also has a 3456 x 2160 OLED option. Ports have also been upgraded: the XPS 17 now has four Thunderbolt 4 ports, while the XPS 15 offers two Thunderbolt 4 ports and a regular USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlPUWg"&gt;The XPS 15 will start at $1,199.99, while the XPS 17 will start at $1,399.99. Dell has yet to announce when the new laptops will be available. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Legion 7i and 5i Pro gaming laptops have tall 16:10 QHD displays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 7i" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_llo48R2zv7iEdP3df4LRws1SCU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267532/legion7ilead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;QHD, 16:10 aspect ratio, 165Hz. So many buzzwords.&lt;/em&gt; | Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZldMG"&gt;Lenovo is banking hard on 16-inch QHD displays in the taller 16:10 aspect ratio with its new lineup of Legion 7i and 5i Pro gaming laptops, and I’m all for it. These laptops are a showcase for crisper, more spacious displays that have a fast 165Hz refresh rate and G-Sync support, as well as faster processors by way of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187586"&gt;Intel’s new 11th Gen H-series CPUs&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also among the first laptops announced to support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22187515"&gt;Nvidia’s lower-end GeForce RTX 3050 and 3050 Ti graphics chips&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to more powerful GPU options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoM1g8"&gt;The Legion 7i is the flagship and can fit the most amount of power, supporting up to a 165W total graphics power (TGP) variant of Nvidia’s RTX 3080 (16GB) with a boost clock of 1,710MHz. That’s more power-hungry than what we’ve seen in most gaming laptops, so it should, theoretically, allow for some fantastic gaming performance. It can be configured with Intel’s flagship Core i9-11980HK processor, too, one of the fastest laptop chips on the market. The Legion 7i comes with a 300W power adapter, though if you’re doing light tasks (and not gaming), it can also recharge via USB-C at 95W. Lenovo says this model will release in June 2021 and will start at $1,769.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo legion 7i" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGFlK9M51tVzzIqJ2Ys-BwJhQFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505278/legion7iports.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion 7i is powerful. It’s also a bit hefty, starting at 5.5 pounds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6NqhP5"&gt;Despite a few differences, many of the Legion 7i’s ports and specs trickle down to the lower-end Legion 5i models announced today, including its two Thunderbolt 4 ports, three full-size USB 3.2 ports, an Ethernet jack, and an HDMI 2.1 port for outputting 4K resolution at up to 120Hz in external displays that support it. They also host fast DDR4 RAM clocked at 3,200MHz and NVMe PCIe SSDs, though the maximum capacity varies depending on the model you’re buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JZEgzn"&gt;If you don’t need quite as much power as the 7i offers, the Legion 5i Pro has a similarly fast, tall pixel-dense 16-inch QHD screen with the same 16:10 aspect ratio. It tops out at the Core i7-11800H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3070 GPU with a maximum TGP of 140W and a boost clock of 1,620MHz, which is still plenty fast. That combination of specs should be sufficient to play most games in QHD resolution at high graphical settings, quite possibly with some ray tracing effects switched on. The Legion 5i Pro will ship in June as well, costing $1,329.99 to start.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo Legion 7i" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hChO1OLWXp5LtEwHcwxKSvd21Ic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505280/legion7irear.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The backside of the flagship Legion 7i. The other models look similar, but lack the RGB lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="K519xe"&gt;The Legion 5i lineup also includes 15-inch and 17-inch variants. The specs don’t spell out all that many differences compared to the 5i Pro, aside from the lack of its 16:10 aspect ratio display. You can still get fast QHD screens with these models, though, and you can configure them with Intel’s Core i7-11800H and the RTX 3070, or save money by knocking them down to the Core i7-11400H CPU and the RTX 3050. Both of these sizes will release in July, and Lenovo says they’ll start at $969.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s Broadcast update filters the sound of a billion sex-starved cicadas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uy0F1dkKYF4V0rkj9SquuYhyzWo=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267531/nvidia_broadcast_app_announcement_gf_lp_og_1200x627.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Cuc7p"&gt;After 17 years, billions of newly hatched cicada nymphs are burrowing up from their earthen lairs right now to party. They will molt, sing, and mate like a society emerging from pandemic with a biological drive to preserve the species. &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brood-x-cicadas-are-emerging-at-last/"&gt;It’s going to get messy&lt;/a&gt; and it’s going to get loud... unless you’re using Nvidia Broadcast which is being updated to filter out the sound of cicadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEEgbL"&gt;Nvidia has been successfully filtering out unwanted background noise from microphones for more than a year now, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229508/nvidia-rtx-voice-background-noise-reduce-graphics-card-improve-call-quality"&gt;impressive results&lt;/a&gt;. The latest Nvidia Broadcast 1.2 update now adds profiles to better isolate the sound of cats, dogs, and insects. If thousands of cicadas start emerging in your backyard this week, Nvidia has a profile ready to filter out the lawnmower-like chorus and save your daily Zoom calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRoMDL"&gt;If you’re lucky to live outside the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/22362042/cicada-brood-x-map-2021"&gt;15 states where cicadas are rising up&lt;/a&gt;, there are some other additions in Nvidia Broadcast 1.2 that will also help with background noise. If you’ve been stuck working from home in an echoey room for the past year, Nvidia says that the latest update will also improve the sound of your voice in rooms with poor acoustics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kjfiAI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use your Nvidia graphics card to improve the quality of your calls ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229508/nvidia-rtx-voice-background-noise-reduce-graphics-card-improve-call-quality"},{"title":"Nvidia’s RTX Voice app was great, and its Broadcast successor is now available ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21444508/nvidia-broadcast-download-rtx-voice-noise-app"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7kvkcD"&gt;Nvidia Broadcast isn’t just all about audio and cicadas, though. Nvidia is also tackling video noise from lower quality webcams that people have been dusting off during the pandemic. This static removal is a beta feature in this update, but it should help improve low-light video calls to generate a cleaner image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P458Cz"&gt;Hopefully this latest update also irons out some bugs that we’ve experienced with Nvidia Broadcast. While the noise removal features work well, the app itself has a tendency to not always work correctly with webcams, crash, or need to be reinstalled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BkGho"&gt;Nvidia Broadcast’s voice filtering capabilities, known as RTX voice, are available on any GeForce, Quadro or TITAN GPUs. You can download the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fbroadcasting%2Fbroadcast-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22430106%2Fnvidia-broadcast-1-2-update-noise-removal-cicadas-pets" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest update from Nvidia’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing’s debut Ear 1 wireless earbuds will launch in June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUH8J6-AobfZ57nky7Q1ZLFLWUI=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69267344/Reveal_of_Name_Landscape_4_KV_Bird.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image teasing the earbuds’ design.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lBX1SZ"&gt;Nothing, the tech startup from ex-OnePlus co-founder Carl Pei, will reveal its debut pair of true wireless earbuds this June. The company says the earbuds will be called Ear 1, but it’s staying tight-lipped about other details like their specs, price, and final design. However, an illustration released alongside today’s blog post shows what appears to be a silhouette of the earbuds with a rather lengthy stem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCH1gx"&gt;We know the earbuds will be designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298802/nothing-teenage-engineering-swedish-design-founding-partner-audio-headphones"&gt;in collaboration with Teenage Engineering&lt;/a&gt; and feature a “stripped-down aesthetic.” A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320915/nothing-true-wireless-earbuds-teenage-engineering-concept-1"&gt;concept render&lt;/a&gt; from March gives more clues like the use of transparent materials in their construction. Nothing announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274087/nothing-carl-pei-true-wireless-headphones-smart-devices-summer"&gt;back in February&lt;/a&gt; that its first products would be wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oh1pDVDlSS7c9adtiM04eRdi5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356090/Nothing_Design_Concept_1___UNDER_EMBARGO_UNTIL_11_AM_GMT_9_MARCH_2021__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nothing&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A concept image illustrating Nothing’s design elements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0MvXB9"&gt;A June product reveal means the company could just about make good on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;January promise&lt;/a&gt; of releasing its debut product in the first half of the year. However, a release that same month isn’t guaranteed. The company only says that it will reveal the product and announce details on how to order them, but it wouldn’t officially confirm a shipment date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1U2vF"&gt;Beyond headphones, Nothing has said it eventually plans to build up an ecosystem of interconnected devices.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TRFJhw"&gt;Peak Design, the bag and accessory maker that created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/11/13240828/peak-design-everyday-backpack-review-not-an-ad"&gt;one of our favorite backpacks&lt;/a&gt;, is launching &lt;a href="https://market.peakdesign.com/"&gt;a new online exchange&lt;/a&gt; in the US for people to buy and sell used Peak Design products. The Peak Design Marketplace opened in beta form in March, but today the used gear storefront opens for anyone looking to buy and sell gear...provided it was made by Peak Design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uglT87"&gt;To sell a product on Peak Design’s marketplace you have to register it on the company’s site (it offers &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWHxt67QoGk"&gt;instructions in video form&lt;/a&gt;) and provide pictures and details of the current condition of what you’re unloading. Peak Design says it reviews every listing and has the right to approve or deny anything before it shows up for sale. The company also provides a recommended sale price, but you can set it to any amount you choose. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2EzuPv"&gt;Buyers will be responsible for covering the shipping (Peak Design tacks it on to whatever price is set) and sellers are responsible for shipping directly to the buyer. Theoretically, that direct shipping could also save on the additional cost and environmental impact that comes with shipping to a third location first, which can be required by other secondhand marketplaces and storefronts such as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thredup.com%2Flp%2Foutfits-you-love%3Freferral_code%3Dadwords_thredup%26utm_medium%3Dcpc%26utm_source%3Dgoogle%26utm_campaign%3D1612558699_59913515694_517653604497_thread%2520up_e_c__9031524_kwd-28818878969_g_%26iv_%3D__iv_p_1_a_1612558699_g_59913515694_c_517653604497_w_kwd-28818878969_n_g_d_c_v__l__t__r__x__y__f__o__z__i__j__s__e__h_9031524_ii__vi__%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjws-OEBhCkARIsAPhOkIZD4B0L9tCYlYE6NT_3cKpDFdUbyjVWnBtchtRuo7HPkVVtm7HZEJQaAo-KEALw_wcB&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22425546%2Fpeak-design-used-bags-equipment-marketplace-craigslist" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ThredUp&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://wornwear.patagonia.com/"&gt;Patagonia’s Worn Wear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RdSMX"&gt;Peak Design is also guaranteeing some basic benefits to used gear — like customer service and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.peakdesign.com%2Fpages%2Fwarranty&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F11%2F22425546%2Fpeak-design-used-bags-equipment-marketplace-craigslist" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lifetime guarantee&lt;/a&gt; — no matter how many times the gear has changed hands. Peak Design’s lifetime guarantee covers manufacturing defects and “Failures or breakages that render part or all of your product to become non-functional,” but not misuse, neglect, or cosmetic blemishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbnQIs"&gt;The disadvantage of Peak Design’s “Craigslist for camera bags” (besides being limited to one brand of product) is how sellers get paid out. Once a buyer receives the product you sold, they have to confirm that what they received is in the same condition as promised. Once everything’s confirmed, the seller gets paid. Peak Design will let you keep 100 percent of your profits for in-store credit or 75 percent if you want to be paid out in cash. The company says it doesn’t pocket that missing 25 percent, and instead uses it to pay &lt;a href="https://www.recurate.com/"&gt;Recurate&lt;/a&gt;, the company that helps manage the marketplace and sends out prepaid shipping labels for sellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49m8Zm"&gt;Setting up a marketplace for used gear is a clever idea: it seems like a good-natured ad for the durability of Peak Design’s products, and it adds a way to try them out for a cheaper price than what they would cost new. Peak Design frames it as environmentally motivated as well — fewer vehicles burning fuel transporting products and less unnecessary packaging. The company also claims Marketplace sales are “100 percent carbon neutral,” though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410367/forest-offsets-trees-carbon-dioxide-accounting"&gt;not all carbon offsets are created equal&lt;/a&gt; (or even used).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wmmk8W"&gt;Losing 25 percent of what you could earn from a sale is not insignificant and will likely force some people in to taking the store credit or selling elsewhere. But more than that, because of the restrictions, the Peak Design Marketplace is sort of an outsourced version of a traditional trade-in program. You have to do the extra bit of work of actually shipping your things, but you could earn more than the flat fee Peak Design might offer if it was running a a trade-in program itself.&lt;/p&gt;
