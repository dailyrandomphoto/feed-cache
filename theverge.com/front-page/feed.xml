    <title>The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Ysdobu3Dq5hfr7-QRZnyVxadrk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079139/Early_Black_Friday_Deals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7vZvx2"&gt;Black Friday officially starts on November 26th, however, we’re already starting to see significant discounts on some of this year’s most popular pieces of tech. Beginning in early October, some retailers — including Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and Walmart — have been lowering prices on goods ranging from Apple’s AirPods to LG’s C1 OLED as a part of their early Black Friday sales. The great news is these stores are now starting to drop prices even more aggressively as we approach the big day, and many of them have price-matching policies that guarantee you’ll get the lowest price. Below we’ve compiled some of the best early Black Friday deals available so far, along with some information about upcoming Black Friday sales so you can prepare and score a great deal before it sells out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="noa6oq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"},{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="fUcNXl"&gt;Amazon Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDZo4M"&gt;Amazon began publishing its Black Friday deals earlier than most retailers, launching mostly single-day sales starting on October 4th. So far, we’ve seen significant deals on Apple products, TVs from Samsung and Sony, Kindles, and more. The retailer continues to launch early Black Friday deals, namely as part of its &lt;a href="https://amazon.com/events/epicdeals?tag=thewire06-20&amp;amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;amp;ascsubtag=dealblogzz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Epic Daily Deals&lt;/a&gt; event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYFV4"&gt;Note that if you’re not already an Amazon Prime member, you can also save a little more money and enjoy two-day shipping when you sign up for a free, month-long trial of Prime. The membership will also give you access to Amazon’s Lightning deals, which are discounts that often only last for a few hours or a single day. After the trial ends, however, you’ll pay $12.99 per month — unless you’re a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/b?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=3&amp;amp;imprToken=92bdf01b-6da1-28cb-387&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=668781011"&gt;student&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/58f8026f-0658-47d0-9752-f6fa2c69b2e2/qualify"&gt;receive qualifying government assistance&lt;/a&gt;, which means you’ll pay either $6.49 or $5.99, respectively — so be aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwMndD"&gt;Right now, Amazon is discounting all sizes of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt;, the LG C1,  and throwing in a six-month subscription to HBO Max. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;48-inch model&lt;/a&gt; is on sale for $1,097 instead of $1,297, while the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65C1PUB-Alexa-Built-Smart/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch is $1,297&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=43&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is selling for $1,797&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which configuration you choose, all sport several features gamers will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR compatibility, and support for HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MqKN84"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDTpC7"&gt;Typically $400, Amazon is currently selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best-sounding noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for non-Apple users — the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VW98ZKG/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=34&amp;amp;imprToken=4cbe668d-20f0-845e-452&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless&lt;/a&gt; — for $248. That’s one of the lowest prices Amazon has ever sold them for. As we wrote in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20843395/sennheiser-momentum-wireless-3-review-release-date-news-specs-features-noise-cancelling-headphones"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the comfortable headphones offer detailed, bass-rich sound while providing 17 hours of playback per charge. They even come outfitted with a USB-C port for charging, and they fold up in a compact manner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWXUjn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5gVG7"&gt;Amazon is also discounting various sizes of Samsung’s The Frame, a unique kind of TV that functions both as wall art and an HDR-compatible QLED. Right now, for example, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VW898FS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model for $1,497&lt;/a&gt; instead of $2,000, and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch for $998&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,500. The TV offers a decor-friendly design while also displaying customizable images when somebody’s in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into a smart 4K TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and a 120Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jNcvZm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qcHKiS"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=44&amp;amp;imprToken=fabe66d6-42ba-471e-6ad&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22512890%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $30&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PuNKYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjBb4F"&gt;Last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-improved-Charging-included/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $100 instead of $150 on Amazon for a limited time. The deal specifically applies to the black, cloud blue, and white variants, each of which comes with a wireless charging case. As we noted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, the lightweight pair of wireless earbuds greatly improve upon the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;original Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; and are a good choice for Android users. The earbuds offer 11 hours of battery life, too, and feature improved microphones that result in far better voice calls. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SzTTnQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyI5ia"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is a smart 4K monitor that acts like a TV for your PC, one you can mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=36&amp;amp;imprToken=fabe66d6-42ba-471e-6ad&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22512890%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $520, its best price to date, with a solar-powered remote control. The monitor can stream HDR10 content from popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2. It also supports Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j22lU8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOJQiS"&gt;If you’re looking to add some storage space to your PC, Amazon is currently discounting Western Digital’s 2TB and 4TB My Passport models in a variety of colors. Typically $380, you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Drive-WDBAGF0020BGY-WESN/dp/B08F1VVBL9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB SSD&lt;/a&gt; for $230, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Passport-External-Portable-Compatible-systems/dp/B08RX3TWJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB model&lt;/a&gt; for $550. Western Digital claims up to sequential read / write speeds of 1,050MB/s and 1,000MB/s, respectively, and the deal also includes a USB Type-A adapter in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlKjia"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10371540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aubBFX"&gt;Other notable deals:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="fKOGHl"&gt;Both the PC and PlayStation 5 versions of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NDYPWK7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are selling for $40 right now instead of $60, which is a good deal on what we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;recently praised&lt;/a&gt; as an amazing action game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VymIfY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wolverine-Gaming-Controller-Wireless-Headset-Bundle/dp/B08NGCT6B1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer’s Wolverine V2 wired gaming controller&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially an affordable version of the Xbox Elite controller, is on sale at Amazon as part of a bundle with a Kaira Pro gaming headset. Normally $250, you can pick up both peripherals for $180 for a limited time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9kKV5j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XL4JHXR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s 11.6-inch Galaxy Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; is now on sale for $190 instead of $250 at Amazon. This particular model includes 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;aside id="FfgzdG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ejfdaH"&gt;Best Buy Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E7iGos"&gt;Best Buy started rolling out big savings in a number of categories on October 18th with Black Friday price protection, meaning Best Buy will refund the difference in price of any item with this guarantee if it drops before November 26th. While anyone can cash in on the current savings, the Black Friday price guarantee only applies to Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members. Best Buy is offering &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free shipping&lt;/a&gt; on any purchase greater than $35, and same-day service is available in certain ZIP codes if you submit your order by 3PM local time. Restrictions apply to certain larger items, however, most of which will require you to schedule a delivery time after making your purchase. If you’re ready to knock out some of your holiday shopping early this year, we’ve collected some of our favorite deals so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DPV4yv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"Best Buy stores will soon offer Samsung foldable repairs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744407/best-buy-authorized-samsung-foldable-repairs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="c5Ol71"&gt;The Lenovo Yoga 9i remains one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687992/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-pro-8-hp-spectre-macbook-air-creator-laptops-compare-specs"&gt;our favorite alternatives to the Microsoft Surface line of ultrabooks&lt;/a&gt; and, right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfThlWBLJhS" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is offering the slick 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; for $1,350. While this model received a similar discount a couple of months ago, it still remains a solid value. The foldable laptop boasts some impressive specs, too, with an 11th Gen Core i7 CPU, 512GB of storage, and Iris Xe integrated graphics. This hardware, paired with a 4K touchscreen display and a garaged stylus, makes the 9i a great choice for creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nisc5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mExVb6"&gt;This 70-inch LG TV may only feature midrange specs, but Best Buy has brought it down to its lowest price ever. The &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTimnyrsb7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG NanoCell 75 series TV is down to just $750&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time, a healthy $450 off the list price. The 4K panel is powered by LG's WebOS smart platform, which offers a solid array of streaming services and includes HDR10 for vivid picture quality. The 75 series also comes equipped with three HDMI ports and ARC compatibility, as well as Apple’s AirPlay 2, which allows you to cast content from your Apple device to your TV. It may not be as impressive as an OLED TV, but $750 for a 70-inch panel is still a solid value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tL6nXD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LReI5f"&gt;A few other hot deals at Best Buy:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KJVtaJ"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max have been available for less, but the cheapest place to get them right now is at Best Buy, where you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkuem3dVe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a pair in any color for $479&lt;/a&gt;, $70 off the regular MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ysr84c"&gt;This 38-inch soundbar from Samsung is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkK7MFOaD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $280 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The 7.1 soundbar comes packaged with a wireless subwoofer and rear-channel speakers, too, helping keep cable clutter to a minimum. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JXqlKy"&gt;Target Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VmdQS9"&gt;Target began releasing some of its first Black Friday deals on October 10th, and has been running similar deals every week since. However, the store &lt;a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2021/10/target-reveals-first-look-at-early-black-friday-sa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will officially launch&lt;/a&gt; weekly “Holiday Best” deals every Sunday starting October 31st both online and in-store; it will also publish additional “Holiday Best” deals from November 4th through November 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QInVnf"&gt;Target RedCard holders can also save an additional 5 percent while enjoying free shipping, and the store will be price matching items purchased between October 10th and December 24th &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/subcategoryarticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Policies+%26+Guidelines&amp;amp;searchQuery=search+help" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with some exclusions&lt;/a&gt;. With all that said, below are some notable deals we already know will take place in the next few weeks you should keep an eye out for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RjbN8y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"},{"title":"The best cheap wireless earbuds to buy in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="agQ676"&gt;Regularly $300, Target will be selling the &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/7moVRr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QuietComfort 35 Noise Canceling Wireless Headphones II&lt;/a&gt; for $180 from November 4th through November 6th. That beats Amazon’s current all-time low of $199. Released in 2017, these wireless noise-canceling headphones can seamlessly switch between two paired devices and, unlike their predecessor, they support Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QWrlAQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10833603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKPeGe"&gt;Target will be taking $350 off the 65-inch version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/donjWq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Element’s affordable, frameless Roku TV&lt;/a&gt; from November 4th through November 6th. Normally $650, the TV will be on sale for $300, more than half off the original price. The 4K Ultra HD TV is compatible with HDR10, offers a 60Hz native refresh rate, and has four HDMI ports. It also supports Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, while additionally working with Chromecast and Apple’s AirPlay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2j4hz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10834759"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aNi8WR"&gt;The &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/YgB3Am" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo 3&lt;/a&gt; will be on sale for $100 at Target from October 31st through November 6th, a cool $100 off the original price tag. Although they’re beginning to show their age, we initially praised the comfortable headphones in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/22/14051984/beats-solo-3-review-apple-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2016 review&lt;/a&gt; and noted how well they isolate exterior noise. They also offer great wireless performance and come in two colorways: black and rose gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CRz9fL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10757348"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="G60grT"&gt;Other notable Target deals happening soon:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2XWmQV"&gt;Target will offer up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/x9QDKd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles from November 4th through November 6th. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1BiPh2"&gt;The retailer will also sell a silver version of &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/a12Qob" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP’s 15.6-inch laptop with Windows Home in S. Mode&lt;/a&gt; for $340 instead of $540 from October 31st through November 6th. This particular model features 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and an Intel 11th Gen Core i3 processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Fqz3U4"&gt;While they did not reveal specific prices, Target also said it will be offering Black Friday deals &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/ZdB3AQ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on TVs from LG, Samsung, TCL, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h64IP9"&gt;Walmart Black Friday deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zULrcm"&gt;The big blue supercenter recently revealed its vertical for its Black Friday deals, which begin November 3rd online and November 5th in stores. While some of these deals will remain live until November 17th, some of them expire as soon as November 7th. Wherever possible, we’ve noted the window of specific deals so you’ll know exactly when to jump on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTwNOz"&gt;Like most online retailers, Walmart offers free two-day shipping on orders over $35, as well as next-day delivery in certain ZIP codes at no extra charge. As an additional perk, Walmart has also extended its standard return policy during the holiday season, with many items purchased between November 1st and December 25 receiving extended return dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmpJFc"&gt;While many of these deals aren’t live yet, we’ve collected a handful that piqued our interest below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Q59sms"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"},{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wDwLVX"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus, the improved version of the original Galaxy Buds, will be &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Walmart for $59&lt;/a&gt; from November 3rd to the 7th. This deal brings them well below their typical $100 price tag, making them an excellent value. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted the drastic improvement in battery life as well as their comfortable fit. While Samsung has since improved on this design with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, adding noise cancellation among other features, their higher price point makes them a slightly tougher sell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qzr2Kf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DJDOSq"&gt;The GoPro Hero 8 Black often retails for $300 on its own, but &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoPro-HERO8-Black-Dual-Battery-Charger-Bonus-Battery%2F199369934&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart will be offering the popular 4K action cam for just $250&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. The bundle also includes a dual battery charger and a total of three batteries, so you’ll never run out of juice. This rugged digital camera is perfectly suited for capturing fast-moving action wherever and whenever it happens. HyperSmooth technology provides an amazing level of image stabilization, while the LiveBurst feature automatically records anything that happens two seconds before and two seconds after your shot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q7R0XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10319874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NwKlAu"&gt;One of our favorite budget tablets from last year just got a little cheaper. The Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Tab-A7-32GB-10-4-Wi-Fi-Gray-SM-T500NZABXAR%2F882296471" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going to be on sale at Walmart for $140&lt;/a&gt; from November 10th through November 14th. This brings it well below the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, which features 32GB of internal storage and a 10.4-inch display. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150980/samsung-galaxy-tab-a7-tablet-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were with the vibrant display and sturdy build quality of this unassuming tablet. It’s not going to rival, say, the latest iPad Air or Mini, but it remains a solid entertainment device, especially if you plan to consume Amazon content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UxwtI2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581085"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DC2Mly"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Morbius has ‘some form of bat radar’ in the first trailer in two years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DelPtskZlkWWSSUDY9do80Ez1k=/457x0:1966x1006/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70079045/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_9.48.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eY7998"&gt;For the first time in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21062568/morbius-trailer-jared-leto-marvel-sony-pictures-venom-michael-keaton-vulture"&gt;nearly two years&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZ6iiRrz1SY"&gt;new trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming Spider-Man spinoff &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Jared Leto as Dr. Michael Morbius, an ailing scientist who inadvertently turns himself into a “pseudo-vampire” while searching for a cure for his rare medical condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMxOU9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt; is an unusual film, even by Sony’s Spider-Man universe standards. The character is what can best be described as a C-list Spider-Man villain, which &lt;em&gt;Morbius &lt;/em&gt;is reimagining as a &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt;-style antihero who wars between his doctoral duties as a healer and his newfound bloodlust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87zbPj"&gt;The new trailer helps give a broad introduction to the character, including his origin story and his powers, which include the usual super-strength and speed, “some form of bat radar,” and a vampire-esque craving for blood. Although, again, Morbius is not technically a vampire. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BS2JGuOqu_XR-2P96qm1_zKMGUo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979130/Screen_Shot_2021_11_02_at_9.43.29_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vp39di"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Morbius is not technically a vampire&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uHCRK4"&gt;Originally set to release on July 10th, 2020, the film was delayed several times due to the shuttering of theaters during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it’s finally set to arrive in theaters on January 28th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwFTfP"&gt;The biggest question is just how &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt; fits into the larger Marvel movie universe. As a Sony-produced film, &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt; — like the two &lt;em&gt;Venom&lt;/em&gt; movies — isn’t directly part of the Marvel Studios-produced MCU franchise (which includes the Tom Holland-starring &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Far From Home&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;em&gt; Morbius&lt;/em&gt; references Venom in the trailer’s final shots, indicating some level of Sony-movie crossover, and Michael Keaton appears to be reprising his role as the Vulture (which he previously played in Marvel Studios’ &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Homecoming&lt;/em&gt;). The post-credit scene of &lt;em&gt;Venom: Let There Be Carnage&lt;/em&gt; and the upcoming multiversal shenanigans of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt; also mean that there could be bigger crossovers on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qaEoAi"&gt;But for now, &lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt; highlights the challenges facing Sony as it continues to build out its Spider-Man adjacent superhero franchise: how do you build an interconnected universe of Spider-Man villains, side characters, and anti-heroes without Spider-Man? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdaYfO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="68Z8hH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmnGPQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzZhQZ73bJ1oqBaQXgqy240kVjI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67838743/acastro_191031_1777_blackFriday_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkLaRj"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the biggest shopping days of the year, a relentless, deals-packed week when you can often find the best prices on tech products like laptops, 4K TVs, phones, video games, and more. And of course, these good deals are all accessible online. Some of them may, in fact, be online exclusives, though many should be available in-store, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnndf2"&gt;You can always count on us to publish the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;best deals that you need to know about&lt;/a&gt;, but if you want to be among the first people to discover price drops on products you’re interested in, you’ll want to get set up with a price-tracking tool. We’ve included a few of our favorite examples below, pointing out how each can help you track deals in slightly different ways, each with its own special features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlTdWR"&gt;All of them are free to use, and once you’ve added products that you’re interested in keeping an eye on, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take any extra action until it comes time to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WfPqYmE-eXi0n3IhHiQ_Kaj4Uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965194/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_6.20.47_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dhsh5E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"&gt;CamelCamelCamel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PWZiHK"&gt;CamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts when they fall as low as you’d like. Once a product reaches a desired price you’ve set or lower, you’ll get an email about it. This price tracker works &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;for products on Amazon, so you’ll need to use one of the trackers featured below if you want to track price fluctuations on Walmart, Best Buy, and other retail sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ipb7m"&gt;To track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll need to create a free CamelCamelCamel account. Also, we suggest installing the &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer"&gt;site’s browser extension&lt;/a&gt; that works with Google Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic, easy to use, and works in the following countries: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzRYbg"&gt;As soon as a product falls below the amount set on your price alert, you’ll instantly get an email. And if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/wishlists/edit"&gt;you can easily import it&lt;/a&gt; into CamelCamelCamel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VM8v9n7kqFU8w_RcwRsEGCXnkgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965220/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_6.34.57_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vxj695"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinhoney.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21587765%2Fblack-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dqWddk"&gt;Like CamelCamelCamel, the Honey browser extension can track the prices of items that you’re interested in, and it will alert you when it finds a deal. However, unlike the price-tracking site above, Honey will also scour each site you visit for offer codes that can be applied to your checkout total to save you even more money. Look for the orange Honey icon that will appear on the right side of your browser window when you land on a product page (you can move its location as you see fit, but that’s where it appears by default). Click that icon to find out historical pricing info, as well as a guess at your chances of getting additional savings with a coupon code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wtzY"&gt;Honey works with Amazon and many other retailers, and you can add items to your “Droplist,” which is a wishlist-meets-price watch list. The convenient Honey add-on also offers a “Smart Droplist” feature, which automatically adds frequently viewed items to your Droplist.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sXyqOIKcsBSHI0A1Gss8j0dbu98=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22965216/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_6.33.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARTuv7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pByL6H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. Its site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;than they do with the above sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvOBPA"&gt;You can type in a product name, like “Nintendo Switch OLED” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to literally any deal relating to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;’ front page or if it earned a high rating from the community. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsUhFjytA9Q9b4Ha8yBF0F6XU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348917/pcpartpicker.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjeV6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/"&gt;PC Part Picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5XXbL"&gt;As you might have guessed with the name, PC Part Picker helps you pick PC components that are compatible with each other and which are not, making the already daunting task of piecing together a DIY PC setup a little easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmbwDP"&gt;That by itself makes it a crucial tool for both veterans and people who are new to building PCs, but it’s also an excellent price tracker, showing you a detailed graph that illustrates the current and prior movement in price for a particular component. It lets you build the PC of your dreams, and it can &lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/pricedrop/"&gt;alert you via email to price drops&lt;/a&gt; for each component from big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and more. That way, you can, say, choose to wait to buy everything until that processor or graphics card comes down to a lower price you know it’s hit before.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3nFz_y_18tvlw7whjhXxvmHjA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19713463/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lHxvBd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fedge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyaI8s"&gt;For a more hands-off approach to seeing if you’re getting a good deal, just use the Microsoft Edge browser. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;For the past year&lt;/a&gt;, the browser has been able to tell you when you’re looking at the best price for a particular product from a range of retailers. If you are, it will tell you. If not, it will helpfully direct you to a retailer where you can get a better deal. It’s a simple as that. Microsoft Edge is available on Windows PC and macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QdCPHz"&gt;Trust the experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="clOoYt"&gt;We’re a discerning bunch here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so don’t fret if you’re going into Black Friday / Cyber Monday without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best deals on tech and keeping our coverage up to date with new sale items while eliminating old ones to avoid any disappointment. While we usually suggest paying attention to deals starting on November 26th, the truth is that several retailers are jumping the gun and offering some great prices already. So, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;bookmark our coverage&lt;/a&gt;, follow the tips above, and start putting aside a little spending cash for the busy Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Opening day at the Amazon 4-Star brick and mortar store located in Soho in New York City." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyUG7BE3sU0uVmia7hA3FBoPa-M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67804971/akrales_180927_2984_0073_2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="woOIOK"&gt;Nothing is more frustrating than buying a new computer, phone, game console, or backpack and finding out that you could have gotten it for a lot cheaper somewhere else. In order to keep customers happy — and prevent them from going elsewhere — many retailers offer price-matching policies where they promise to match a lower price that you’ve found elsewhere. They will also sometimes match themselves if you buy something that goes down in price a week later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ax9brN"&gt;What follows are the price-matching policies for a variety of major retailers. There are a few things to make note of here. First, all price-matching policies have a number of rules attached to them. We’ve summarized some of the rules here, but you’d be advised to go to the links that we’ve provided and read the policy carefully. Second, and logically enough, retailers that are marketplaces for other sellers, such as Amazon or Costco, don’t have price-matching policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XPiVHS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570161/holiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SnrYOy"&gt;Finally, most retailers that do have price-matching policies suspend them for special occasions, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday. So if your favorite store isn’t offering a Black Friday deal on that phone you want, you can’t wave an ad showing a 50 percent off deal from another retailer and expect it to be honored. But at other times of the year, these price matches can save you a nice amount of cash. So keep them in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VL1GkN"&gt;Another thing to keep in mind: there are exceptions to most rules. So if you’re looking for a deal on a product and you know of a lower price elsewhere (or one that was offered previously at the same retailer), it never hurts to call and ask if they’ll match the price. Meanwhile, we will continue to update this page if and when we get more information about retailers’ policies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="zlWjKJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201895700"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Da17oI"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t offer price matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0xnH6m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/sales-support/sales-policies/retail_us.html"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5zjbYJ"&gt;While we’ve &lt;a href="https://thekrazycouponlady.com/tips/money/save-apple-products"&gt;seen some claims&lt;/a&gt; that Apple will price-match up to 10 percent for products bought at certain major retailers, there is no official policy on the company’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rPGuh"&gt;Apple does say that if it reduces its price on an Apple-branded product within 14 days from when you received your item, you can visit an Apple Store or contact the Apple Contact Center at 1-800-676-2775 to request a refund or get credit for the price difference.  However, that doesn’t apply to special sales like Black Friday or Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Qi8pdG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/6744eb1c-2f60-4f58-b788-fe62bdda77c5"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UbTuol"&gt;B&amp;amp;H says that it might be able to honor a current lower price or match the price of a competitor, but it does so on a case-by-case basis. You have to contact its Customer Service team using the on-site &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2Fshcalendar.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FcontactForm.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;, or by calling (800) 221-5743 / (212) 239-7765.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dNk2pN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fcustomer-service%2Fprice-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat290300050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat290300050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lR0K8U"&gt;Best Buy’s Price Match Guarantee states that a product could be eligible for a price reduction if it’s new, identical to the competitor’s product, immediately available at a qualifying competitor’s store or on its site, and not shown on &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s exclusion list&lt;/a&gt; (which includes “items for sale the Friday before Thanksgiving Day through the Monday after Thanksgiving”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLKa50"&gt;However, Best Buy &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-holiday-faqs%2Fpcmcat748300621076.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300621076&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;will refund&lt;/a&gt; Best Buy Totaltech and My Best Buy members the difference on any “Black Friday Price Guarantee” item whose prices go lower on or before November 26th. Members will receive their refunds by December 15th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="online-tab"&gt;You have to either communicate with Best Buy via its on-site chat, making sure you’re able to show the ad or website with a lower price, to get the difference. Alternatively, you can call 1-888-237-8289 or visit any Best Buy or Pacific Sales store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA0C0T"&gt;Best Buy will also, upon request, &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Fbest-buy-price-match-guarantee%2Fpcmcat297300050000.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat297300050000&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;match its previous in-store or online price&lt;/a&gt; as long as it’s done during the return and exchange period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4PeVC3"&gt;Costco does not price-match with competitors. However, according to the website, it will &lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/628/related/1"&gt;issue a credit for the difference between the price you paid and a promotional price&lt;/a&gt; if you bought the item online at Costco.com and requested the credit up to 30 days before the change in price. If you bought the product from a Costco warehouse location, visit the membership counter at the store where you made the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jIkK4a"&gt;Before you make a purchase, Dell will price-match a new computer that shares the same key features and specs as the one you bought (such as memory, hard drive capacity, processor, etc.) from Dell, HP, Apple, or Lenovo. You can call 1-844-906-4250 or &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/lp/chat-live-with-product-expert" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;chat online&lt;/a&gt; and show a Dell sales expert a link to the competitor’s product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4kwKE"&gt;You can also contact the company about a price difference within 30 days of purchase. However, there is a long list of restrictions, and none of this is available between Thanksgiving Day and the Monday following Thanksgiving or on Green Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="3KrRyo"&gt;We could not find any evidence of a price-matching policy at DJI. However, if DJI reduces the price on a product within seven days from when you received it, you can contact the company within that time at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dji.com%2Fcontact&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.dji.com/contact&lt;/a&gt; to request a refund or credits for the difference between the price you have been charged and the current selling price. This doesn’t include special sales events, such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1z7myz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fbest-price-guarantee%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSqKIj"&gt;If you find a lower price from a qualifying competitor on an eBay Deal item that you bought within 48 hours — or on another product with the “Best Price Guarantee” symbol attached to it — you’ll get “110 percent” of the difference. That means eBay will give you an eBay coupon for the difference in price between what you bought the item for and what the competitor is selling it for, plus an additional 10 percent of that price difference. Note, however, these coupons will expire within 30 days of being issued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmKMzB"&gt;The products must be new and unopened and identical to the competitor’s item. You have to contact &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fbuying%2Fpaying-items%2Febay-deals-price-match-guarantee%3Fid%3D4627%26st%3D2%26pos%3D3%26query%3DeBay%2520Deals%2520Price%2520Match%2520Guarantee%26intent%3Dbest%2520pri%23contactWay&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay Customer Service&lt;/a&gt;, and if they verify your claims are legitimate, you will receive the coupon and be able to use it toward your next eBay purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kKze31"&gt;&lt;a href="https://care.gamestop.com/"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YUBNOV"&gt;Wario64, one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1387484248412540928"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021 the store &lt;a href="https://screenrant.com/gamestop-price-matching-first-improvement-new-leadership/#:~:text=According%20to%20Wario64%2C%20GameStop%20has,like%20flash%20deals%20and%20bundles."&gt;has issued&lt;/a&gt; a price-matching policy. At this time, however, we could not find any evidence of one at GameStop. We will contact their representatives and update this post when we get a definitive answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QSyTYW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleshopping/answer/9248265?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=9112467"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXpzci"&gt;According to the Google site, the company doesn’t price match at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="luaqEM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.hp.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpcv%2Fpricematch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5bEOgs"&gt;According to HP.com, the company will match the current pre-tax price for new comparable PCs and identical HP printer, display, and accessory model numbers from nationally recognized online retailers, such as Dell, Amazon, or Best Buy. The specs have to be the same; however, the product model number does not need to be identical for computers. You have to ask for the match at the time of purchase by calling&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;1-800-888-0229. You can’t request a price match via email or chat, either, and the policy does not extend to items bought during promotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5RzcqT"&gt;If you find a comparable product at a lower price during the return period, you can email HP at &lt;a href="mailto:myhpsales@hp.com"&gt;myhpsales@hp.com&lt;/a&gt;. This only applies to branded HP products and doesn’t apply to products purchased during certain sales events, like the week of Thanksgiving through the week following Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zlGHar"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fshopping-faq%2F%3ForgRef%3Dhttps%25253A%25252F%25252F%23payments&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EZgY6s"&gt;Lenovo will match the price of comparable Lenovo, HP, or Dell PCs with the same key specs a nationally recognized online retailer sells at the time of purchase. You can call 1-855-253-6686 and select option 2&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to get the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puO6jm"&gt;Lenovo will also refund you the difference if the price of a product you buy from the company lowers during the holiday season. Through January 17th, 2021, customers can request an adjustment on orders made on its site between October 18th, 2021 and December 17th, 2021 (for up to five of the same products). You can still request a price adjustment outside of that time frame within 30 calendar days from the date of invoice. Note this does not apply to special discount offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8zU8pt"&gt;To get the holiday season price difference credit, you’ll need to fill out a form on the site and take a screenshot of the lower price on Lenovo.com with a date/time stamp included. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S3XMgj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fb%2Fwhy-microsoft-store%3Ficid%3Dfooter_why-msft-store_7102020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Umm33M"&gt;Microsoft will refund you the difference if it lowers the price of a product within 30 days of purchase. For Surface devices, you have up to 60 days but with some exclusions — the price match doesn’t extend to the Surface Hub, for example. You can call 1-877-696-7786 to get a refund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6E4o7E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpromotions.newegg.com%2Fnepro%2F16-2624%2Findex.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570383%2Fprice-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndafcr"&gt;Newegg offers price-matching on select items; these products are identified by the label “Price Match Guarantee” that appears in the price box on the right of the product page. This applies whether you find that lower price on Newegg or at what Newegg judges to be a major retailer. You need to notify Newegg of the lower price within 14 days of purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mi0pN6"&gt;The price-match guarantee is not valid during major holiday sales events, including Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Green Monday. However, Newegg does offer what it calls &lt;a href="https://kb.newegg.com/knowledge-base/black-friday-price-protection/"&gt;“Black Friday Price Protection”&lt;/a&gt; — if you purchase any product that has that badge, is purchased between October 14th, 2021 and November 21st, 2021, and is discounted on or before November 30th, 2021, you can be refunded the difference. According to Newegg, you don’t have to do anything; the refund will be processed by December 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sam’s Club" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vjZCu1J7q57UiuVsuPqUpZtZ6O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/800956/uuunxxqfdqd.jpg"&gt;

&lt;p id="oTri2i"&gt;If you buy a product online, you can request a price match within eight days of purchase for Sam’s Club items with promotional prices. Neither deal applies to events such as Black Friday or Cyber Monday, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BwHpGp"&gt;

&lt;p id="PTIGUW"&gt;We didn’t find anything on the Sonos site about price-matching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gUKzHp"&gt;&lt;a href="http://help.target.com/help/SubCategoryArticle?childcat=Price+Match+Guarantee&amp;amp;parentcat=Availability+%26+Pricing"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0LHIy"&gt;Target will match the price of an item that you find for less either at Target or at a &lt;a href="https://target.scene7.com/is/content/Target/GUEST_625b83e8-f353-41bf-8a1c-abc6876f482f"&gt;select list of competitors&lt;/a&gt; if you ask for it at the time of or within 14 days of your purchase. You can either bring your proof into the store or call for online purchases at 1-800-591-3869. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j58EZZ"&gt;If you buy a product in-store or online starting October 10th, 2021, Target will also adjust the price if it lowers it on or before December 24th, 2021. Additionally, Target will price match designated discounted items that are a part of its “Holiday Best” sale if their price goes down through December 24th, 2021. Clearance sales and other storewide or category promotions are excluded. There is a complete list of exceptions on the website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="dJElQg"&gt;Walmart’s online store offers price matching on one in-stock item per customer per day from a specified list of retailers. There is a long list of restrictions on the site; for example, it &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/policies#price-match-policy"&gt;does not apply to in-store purchases&lt;/a&gt;, and it does not apply to prices shown during pre-Black Friday events, as well as Black Friday and Cyber Week. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nj1X37"&gt;Black Friday officially kicks off on November 26th, but if you plan to make that the only day you buy gifts this holiday season, you’re missing out. Several retailers, including Best Buy and Target, are already getting a head start on rolling out their holiday discounts. Best Buy has even been offering price protection for Black Friday deals since mid-October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjhxYw"&gt;Whether you take advantage of the slew of early Black Friday deals or hold off until the day after Thanksgiving, it’s important to know how every major retailer is handling the shopping event this year. Some retailers, for instance, are still approaching things a bit differently due to the ongoing pandemic, with many offering deals over the weeks leading up to Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In either case, if you plan to spend some money, here are the schedules and expectations for the retailers that we know so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4LWLGs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="NNg8qr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MqZ6OC"&gt;Amazon has not yet announced its full Black Friday playbook, but the recently rebranded &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/events/epicdeals"&gt;Epic Daily Deals&lt;/a&gt; is a bit of a prelude, one in which you can find deals on everything from Shark vacuums to Samsung’s art-inspired Frame TV. For now, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/blackfriday"&gt;Black Friday landing page&lt;/a&gt; links to its Epic Daily Deals, which will likely be where Black Friday deals will live when the time arrives. We will update this post when we have a better idea as to what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JOwtYy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSUzeMGfPq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SOgpOe"&gt;Black Friday savings have already kicked off to some degree at Best Buy. The retailer is offering various specials through its &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Felectronics%2Fblack-friday%2Fpcmcat225600050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat225600050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Early Deals Event&lt;/a&gt;, which includes Black Friday price guarantees. Said guarantee is a price protection that’s available to members of Best Buy’s premium Totaltech plan and My Best Buy, the retailer's free membership program. Signing up for either membership ensures that if you purchase a qualifying item between October 18th and November 18th and it receives a bigger discount before November 26th, you can be refunded the difference. As with some of the Black Friday promos, you’ll want to make sure you’re signed in with your My Best Buy account while browsing to see the lowest price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ujHYp9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftarget-black-friday%2F-%2FN-5q0f2&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jnNqHP"&gt;Target &lt;a href="https://corporate.target.com/press/releases/2021/10/target-reveals-first-look-at-early-black-friday-sa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced a host of early Black Friday savings&lt;/a&gt;, billed as weeklong Holiday Best deals, which began October 31st. Each Sunday in November, Target will showcase new Holiday Best deals at brick-and-mortar stores and online. Target says it will be offering the best prices throughout the season; however, the retailer also has a &lt;a href="https://help.target.com/help/targetguesthelparticledetail?articleId=ka95d000000LACzAAO&amp;amp;articleTitle=How+does+the+holiday+price+match+policy+work%3F&amp;amp;clickSearchVar=Search+Results&amp;amp;searchQuery=How+does+the+holiday+price+match+policy+work" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;holiday price match policy&lt;/a&gt; in place if it happens to offer a better deal on an item before December 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i07aP4"&gt;As far as deals go, Target is offering the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbeats-solo-wireless-headphones%2F-%2FA-79437096%3Fpreselect%3D79358892%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones for 50 percent off&lt;/a&gt; and the popular &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fbose-quietcomfort-35-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones-ii%2F-%2FA-52955552%3Fpreselect%3D52791828%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bose QC35 II noise-canceling headphones for $180&lt;/a&gt; ($120 off) during its first week of holiday deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bKaERq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fwalmart-black-friday-2021%2F1076614&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YmIY6n"&gt;Walmart is starting to roll out Black Friday deals early as part of its Deals for Days event, which begins on Wednesday, November 3rd. Some deals beginning on the 3rd, as well as others slotted for November 10th, can already be previewed in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fwalmart-black-friday-2021%2F1076614&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online circulars&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are certainly to come, and paid Walmart Plus subscribers will get a special four-hour window of early access to all Black Friday deals throughout the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVjF9N"&gt;Upcoming deals for November 3rd deals include the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHP-X360-14-CELERON-TOUCH-CB-AE%2F344923046&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HP Chromebook x360&lt;/a&gt;, which can be had for $179 ($120 off). Starting November 10th, you’ll also be able to get a set of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen AirPods with the wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; for $89, saving you $30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h4naGk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeBFearly2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fdeals%2Fblack-friday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RhJWHy"&gt;There is no word yet on Black Friday details from GameStop. Although the gaming retailer rolled out some Black Friday-like deals in October — the PlayStation 5 version of &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeBFearly2021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; was recently on sale for just $40&lt;/a&gt; — there is certainly more to come. We expect to hear more regarding store hours on Black Friday and possibly Thanksgiving, as well as some specifics regarding what kind of gaming deals it plans to offer throughout the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ayNvql"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fnepro%2F21-2291%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Myj7Gp"&gt;Newegg hasn’t announced its deals for Black Friday, but &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fnepro%2F21-2291%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its site indicates&lt;/a&gt; the sales will start on November 22nd. There is also a live timer that, at the time of this posting, seems to be counting down to 2AM ET on November 21st. Newegg also promises a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fnepro%2F21-2209%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price protection program&lt;/a&gt; for eligible products on its site bought from October 14th through November 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PKQR5Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/black-friday.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qrLz9O"&gt;Costco has announced what it calls “Holiday Savings” deals for Thanksgiving Day online and a mix of in-warehouse and online deals running from November 26th through the 29th. It advertises savings on Apple products beginning on Thanksgiving, but none of them are currently listed. Some notable deals we know of right now include &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-77-class-a1-series-4k-uhd-oled-tv-allstate-3-year-protection-plan-bundle-included-for-5-years-of-total-coverage*.product.100761684.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 77-inch A1-Series OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a $100 streaming credit for $2,500, and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-86-class-nano85-series-4k-uhd-led-lcd-tv-allstate-3-year-protection-plan-bundle-included-for-5-years-of-total-coverage*.product.100761657.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LG’s 86-inch 4K LCD TV for $2,000&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with a $200 Costco gift card. If huge TVs aren’t your thing, you can also get &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/google-nest-wifi-router-ac2200-smart-mesh-wi-fi-router-4-pack.product.100517182.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off a four-pack of Google Nest WiFi routers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/beats-studio-buds-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-earbuds.product.100779535.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$50 off a pair of Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; with a $10 Apple gift card, among other deals.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Know the holiday shipping and return policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="samsung experience store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f97dE635Tu-ZVkNyI4aPVE0cHiM=/105x0:795x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67804922/experience_stores_middle_row1.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDTB22"&gt;With the holiday season right around the corner, everyone is double-checking their lists and figuring out the best places to fulfill those orders. Thankfully, there are often a number of options when it comes to retailers that have what you want. Because of this, online retailers aren’t just dropping prices to compete with each other, but offering more generous shipping and return policies for their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjdpKv"&gt;Most people will still be doing the majority of their shopping online this year, which means that most retailers will be offering free shipping for anyone who spends a set dollar amount. However, this sudden surge in online shopping does increase the possibility for delays as online retailers become flooded with orders and their logistics struggle to keep pace. While this may not be the case across the board, we’d recommend getting your orders in early wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wxXOrP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Know the price-matching policies for Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21570383/price-matching-policy-apple-google-microsoft"},{"title":"How to find the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21587765/black-friday-cyber-monday-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="eJP472"&gt;Below, we’ve collected the current shipping and return policies for a number of major online retailers. Very few of them have policies that pertain specifically to holiday shipping, but we’ll be keeping tabs on them and updating our alphabetical list accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INRR1b"&gt;Hopefully, knowing more about how much you’ll spend and how much leeway you have to make a return will help lessen your holiday angst somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol18Sw"&gt;Note: like last year, the vast majority of online retailers quote no-contact delivery for their products due to the ongoing pandemic. So, unless your package is listed as “signature required,” we recommend that you track your packages closely to make sure you know precisely when they’re due to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NPvilQ"&gt;Amazon &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F712kX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;nodeId=468520&amp;amp;ref_=footer_shiprates"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Prime members get free same-day delivery on qualifying orders over $35 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=psdd_help?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=8729023011"&gt;qualifying ZIP codes&lt;/a&gt;. If you aren’t in one of those ZIP codes, the usual next-day or two-day deliveries apply, depending on the product. Non-Prime buyers will find shipping options on the order page of each specific product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6LfVz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201819200"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;During the holidays, items shipped by Amazon between October 1st, 2021 and December 31st, 2021 can be returned until January 31st, 2022. (This applies to both Prime and non-Prime buyers.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple Store Beijing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sIg_P1Csxl2HNhue8mdiCOvLEaE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10968695/apple-store-beijing.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Store Beijing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dAAANq"&gt;Apple &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaJcT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/shipping_delivery"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; If you buy directly from Apple, shipping is free on all orders; however, how fast you will get your item can vary. Two-day shipping is free on most items, and in-stock Macs, iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, or Apple TVs usually get free next-day shipping. This policy can fluctuate based on the item you’re purchasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7DaqO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/help/returns_refund"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Apple’s holiday return policy allows for products that are received between November 1st and December 25th to be returned through January 8th. Any purchase made after December 25th is subject to the standard return policy, and all the usual terms and conditions apply. Please note that this only applies to items that were purchased directly from Apple or an Apple retail store. Otherwise, you need to follow the specific retailer's policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fb3BNk"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="32yxRo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FHelpCenter%2FShipping.jsp%23freeShipping&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;B&amp;amp;H offers free standard shipping (that’s one to seven business days) for most items and free expedited shipping (one to three business days) for items over $49. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CI68a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Ffind%2FHelpCenter%2FReturnExchange.jsp&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21570161%2Fholiday-shipping-return-policy-apple-google-microsoft-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;B&amp;amp;H allows purchases bought after October 18th, 2021 and before January 2nd, 2022 to be returned or exchanged through February 1st, 2022 (with the usual exceptions of non-returnable items such as computers or TVs whose packaging has been opened).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Buy UK store" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xhZlsHCXkJOCydmX5NcE4-UKnec=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/assets/779529/best-buy-uk-store.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="e1fEeV"&gt;Best Buy &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="csNbZG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Ffree-shipping%2Fpcmcat276800050002.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat276800050002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Best Buy is offering free next-day shipping on orders costing $35 and up (with some exceptions). However, this delivery policy is based on product availability, what you purchased, and when you purchased it. Best Buy clearly states that there are limitations on its next-day deliveries during Thanksgiving week, for instance, and that larger appliances, like TVs, require a scheduled delivery with &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftv-home-theater%2Ffree-tv-shipping-or-delivery%2Fpcmcat748300551037.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat748300551037&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;different terms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVurd4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhelp-topics%2Freturn-exchange-policy%2Fpcmcat260800050014.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat260800050014&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;Purchases made from October 18th, 2021 through January 2nd, 2022 can be returned through January 16th, 2022. This doesn’t include items that come with a third-party contract, such as phones, cellular tablets, and wearables (which have a 14-day return period), or holiday products, such as tree decorations, and major appliances, which have a 15-day return window. My Best Buy Elite members have until January 16th or 30 days from receipt, whichever is longer; Elite Plus members have until January 16th or 45 days from receipt, whichever is longer. Finally, Best Buy Totaltech members have until January 16th or 60 days from receipt, whichever is longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MKR2oa"&gt;Costco &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Hhhz3G"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1152"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shipping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Costco doesn’t offer free shipping and quotes its shipping fees during checkout; fees depend on the product and the shipping method. However, the wholesale retailer does offer a variety of delivery options, including “white glove” service for larger appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnmKbu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://customerservice.costco.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/1191/related/1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Returns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Costco generally has an open return policy, except for electronics such as TVs and computers, which have a 90-day return window.

    <title>The Verge’s Guide to Black Friday 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Mspf2aQxkdLOwYnorCovtLcAh4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851504/The_Verges_Guide_to_Black_Friday_2021.9.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aqtAPK"&gt;Black Friday usually begins the day after Thanksgiving in the US, but in 2021, that’s just when it’ll morph into its final form. The once-a-year deal extravaganza is already happening at a couple of retailers, including Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. Each has marked down a batch of tech products weeks ahead of schedule, and each retailer is frequently sharing more deals and details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHXA0k"&gt;If you want to get your shopping started earlier than usual, you can and absolutely should. Most retailers that are offering early Black Friday deals also have good price-matching (or at least price protection) policies for many of them, so you likely won’t regret crossing off your checklist now instead of later this month. You’ll find all of the latest deals and must-know details to make your shopping journey easier right here on this page, whether you’re looking for a steep discount on a laptop, 4K TV, or pair of noise-canceling headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn9WR8"&gt;Of course, you’ll definitely want to see what kind of show-stopping deals will eventually land starting on Thanksgiving evening on November 25th, followed by a new wave of deals coming early in the morning on Black Friday, November 26th. This page will transform throughout the weekend, culminating in the final wave of deals crashing down for Cyber Monday. It sounds exhausting, but our team is up to the task of helping you score all of the tech deals you have your eye on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nest smart speakers and displays are up to 50 percent off this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGujrEqAiGxOE0k4oHPgH1XizoQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078841/dseifert-nest-audio-4225-10.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Audio is a well-reviewed option from Google, and even more worth considering now on discount.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S285r3"&gt;The world of smart home accessories grows each year, with the occasional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;new idea&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;latest iterations on mainstay staples&lt;/a&gt;. This segment also heats up around the holiday shopping season and Black Friday as discounts become available, which is ideal because so many of them make great gifts. If you’re invested at all in Google’s Nest products — or you’re looking to dive in and test the waters — this week’s deals have a variety options you might want to strongly consider. Right now, there are significant discounts on Google Nest products at multiple retailers, including Best Buy, Wellbots, and more, encompassing smart speakers, video doorbells, home security, and smart displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCuzTH"&gt;First off, and leading our selection of Nest deals, is the latest Google Nest Audio smart speaker. No other smart speaker sounds this good in this small of a form factor, and at such a convenient price. This week the Nest Audio is available for the all-time low price of just $60 — making it a very compelling option as a solo speaker or paired with a second unit in stereo. That’s a full $40 off its usual retail price of $100, and you can pick it up at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUCWHFwCy2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-audio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81539079%3Fpreselect%3D80209773%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Daudio%3Fvariant%3D39689491578928&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1597174-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01586_us_nest_audio_charcoal.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or even the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_audio?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt; itself. The Nest Audio comes in chalk, charcoal, sand, sage, and sky colorways. Having options is nice, and having options for such a well-reviewed speaker is even better. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WxX8RS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAUnMC"&gt;The Google Nest Hub established its roots as the Google Home Hub, debuting in 2018, and was beloved for being such a convenient window into a shared stream of Google Photos imagery. It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18530609/google-nest-smart-home-brand-merging-hub-max-rebrand-io-2019" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rebranded as the Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; and followed up with a sequel for a second generation. Now, the second-gen model has lain a bit dormant on making big changes or massive innovations that really improve the original formula, but it is still a worthwhile digital picture frame and small smart speaker accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mUlsl"&gt;At a discounted price of just $50, a full 50 percent off its usual $100 asking price, it’s a worthwhile consideration for your home or the home of any loved ones. You can easily set up a shared album on Google Photos and have your family members see the pictures on the Nest Hub as they’re uploaded to the cloud. You can pick one up in the available colors of chalk, charcoal, mist, or sand at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUC5Y0GZPi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-2nd-gen-smart-display%2F-%2FA-82678346%3Fpreselect%3D79796810%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1629831-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01331_us_nest_hub_2_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_hub_2nd_gen?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BLfxMr"&gt;If a Nest Hub seems a bit quaint, and you prefer living large, there’s also a deal on the Google Nest Hub Max. The Nest Hub Max is the supersized sibling to the standard Nest Hub, with a 10-inch display in lieu of seven inches and a bigger speaker for more room-filling audio. The Nest Hub Max’s fuller sound, built-in camera, and larger screen lends itself better to tasks like videoconferencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVqkED"&gt;The Nest Hub Max is currently on sale for $179, an equal discount of $50 compared to the standard Nest Hub. You can pick it up in chalk or charcoal colorways at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDg6C53KX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dhub%2Dmax&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Hub-Max-Charcoal%2F842552117%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hub-max%2F-%2FA-78295230%3Fpreselect%3D76500129%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1499418-REG%2Fgoogle_ga00426_us_nest_hub_max_chalk.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_nest_hub_max?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="67FNYt"&gt;The latest version of Google’s Nest Doorbell is a smart video doorbell that is battery powered and can detect subjects automatically. Being battery powered allows it to work remotely with a Nest Mini for an audible chime or connect to home wiring to use an existing doorbell chime. Atop the oblong-shaped doorbell is a video camera capable of 30 frames per second recording and object detection for people, packages, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFOBUX"&gt;Normally $180, and announced just in August, the Nest Doorbell is already seeing a significant discount. The sale price this week drops the Nest Doorbell down to $130, saving you $50 in any of its ash, ivy, linen, or snow colorways. Once again, you have your choice of retailers offering this deal: &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDsbIb4ns" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dwireles%2Ddoorbell&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGoogle-Nest-Doorbell-Battery-Video-Doorbell-Camera-Wireless-Doorbell-Security-Camera-Snow%2F983055336&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wallmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-doorbell-battery%2F-%2FA-84283100%3Fpreselect%3D82685731%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657265-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01318_us_nest_hello_video_doorbell.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_doorbell_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22710545/nest-doorbell-battery-cam-battery-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5Z3gFD"&gt;Google’s offering for home surveillance don’t stop at your front porch and protecting your packages. It has even more options in the Nest line of security cameras for indoor and outdoor use, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;many of which are recent additions&lt;/a&gt; but already available for exceptional deals this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FjgRLc"&gt;Starting from the outside, Google’s outdoor Nest Camera with floodlight is designed to monitor things outside the home — normally best suited to being posted up above a garage door or adjacent to a front door. It has object detection like the Nest Doorbell, and it can send a live feed to a Nest Hub display inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5mWKF"&gt;The Nest floodlight camera is currently $50 off, dropping the price to $230. This, as well as the following deals on Nest cams, is quite exceptional since none of these products have been out very long. Though you can pick up this one for the $230 sale price at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDyQfR21g" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-cam-with-floodlight%2F-%2FA-83702962%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dcamera%2Dwith%2Dflood%2Dlight%3F%5Fpos%3D7%26%5Fsid%3D6c742401f%26%5Fss%3Dr&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657422-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02411_us_nest_cam_with_floodlight.html%3Fsts%3Dpi%26pim%3DY&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_floodlight?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="t9KG9g"&gt;Moving from outdoor to indoor / outdoor duties, the standard battery-powered Google Nest Cam is also on sale, available as a standalone unit or in a two-pack. If opting for one camera, the current $30 discount yields a $150 deal price. Or you can opt for a two-pack at $280, saving you $50 off the standard $330 price. Buying in bulk offers more value, and these lights offer the versatility of battery-powered usage in the home or outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swx4hm"&gt;For a single cam deal, you can get the $150 price point at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUDEcZGyjH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-indoor-outdoor-cam-battery%2F-%2FA-82685730%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergegooglenestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;amp;u=1225169&amp;amp;m=83747&amp;amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dindoor%2Doutdoor%2Dwireless%2Dcamera&amp;amp;afftrack=VergeGoogleNestbreakout" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wellbots&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1657274-REG%2Fgoogle_ga01317_us.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F2%2F22757318%2Fgoogle-nest-smart-home-audio-speaker-assistant-video-doorbell-home-hub-cam-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_battery?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Grab the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 for its lowest price ever at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: Asus Zephyrus G15" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YNVVTBeiBAMHfZrct8xQ4CCD0tc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078722/akrales_210226_4440_0022.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ex7aC"&gt;One of our favorite gaming laptops, the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15, is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUwzwuYGlu" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for its lowest price ever at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. And this is the model to get, as it features an RTX 3070 graphics chip, 1TB of NVMe SSD storage, and 16GB of RAM. Topping it all off, the laptop is powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS processor, and it has a 1440p display with a 165Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SXPPe"&gt;This deal knocks $300 off the regular price, dropping it down to just $1,550, which is actually the same price that Asus is asking for its lesser 14-inch G14 laptop that has an RTX 3060. Our reviewer Monica Chin was impressed by the G15’s ability to compress such impressive performance into a lightweight and portable package. If this wasn’t sweet enough, this laptop also comes packaged with a free month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiZoG2"&gt;Overall, we consider the Zephyrus G15 to be an excellent laptop, with the lack of a webcam being one of the few caveats to this otherwise impressive piece of hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jJs8gN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10385239"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4vVzIq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptop in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="BEpagn"&gt;Newegg has discounted the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fcore-black-msi-gp-series-gp66-leopard-11uh-032-gaming-entertainment%2Fp%2FN82E16834155852" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;15.6-inch MSI GP66 Leopard gaming laptop to $1,900&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it down to its lowest price ever. This deal gets even better since you can send in a mail-in rebate to get an extra $100 off for a final cost of $1,800. This laptop is one of a handful of models that comes equipped with an RTX 3080 graphics card for peak mobile gaming performance, and the inclusion of HDMI and Mini Display Port inputs allows you to project to multiple displays. In addition to its powerful graphics card, the GP66 also features 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 CPU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8R2l9f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10839598"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YIWEtE"&gt;If you missed out on the promotion last weekend, you can still cash in on this discounted subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate at Eneba. Regularly $45, you can &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22514911%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/authors%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;ued=https://www.eneba.com/us/xbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-3-month-membership-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global/best-pick" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab a three-month subscription for $25&lt;/a&gt; with the code &lt;strong&gt;90DAYS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate remains one of the best values in gaming currently, granting you unlimited access to a vast library of games on PC and Xbox that you pay for on a monthly basis, even brand-new titles like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22739294/age-of-empires-4-review-pc-game-pass-microsoft" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Age of Empires 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Being a Game Pass subscriber even grants you up to 20 percent off on some titles if you ever want to keep them forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AmXTPy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wkJRdp"&gt;Our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, the Sony WH-1000XM4s, are still available for their lowest price yet at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM4-Canceling-Headphones-phone-call/dp/B0863TXGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUBu6Dwsda" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally $350, this deal brings these cans down to just $248. Besides providing industry-leading noise cancellation, our reviewer Chris Welch particularly liked the improved voice quality and the addition of multipoint Bluetooth connectivity. These over-ear headphones are able to last up to 30 hours on a single charge and provide a comfortable listening experience with plush ear pads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LcY3hz"&gt;The Apple-centric Powerbeats Pro earbuds are currently enjoying a discount of $100, bringing them down to just $150 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B088KTR418/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fpowerbeats-pro-wireless-earphones-black%2F-%2FA-54610898&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeals110221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Designed foremost for working out, these earbuds are sweat and water resistant, and they feature an ear hook design to keep them firmly planted in your ears while on a jog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0WgBx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the “epic” battery life of these earbuds, which can last up to 24 hours with its almost comically large charging case. It dwarfs the AirPods case by comparison, but similarly relies on a Lightning cable to top it off between uses. These are mild inconveniences, though, for a pair of earbuds that punch well above their weight in terms of sound quality and remain comfortably planted in your ears, even during more intense activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="RmVuaK"&gt;If you need a portable drive to tote around projects and files, this ruggedized 1TB model from SanDisk is available for its lowest price ever at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727920735101244007" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GTYFC37/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model of the SanDisk Extreme increases the read speed to 1050MB/s and the write speed to 1000MB/s with its USB-C interface, but also comes packaged with a USB-A adapter to make it compatible with a wide variety of devices. The integrated loop makes it easy to clip this external hard drive to the inside of a backpack or camera bag, and the IP55 dust and water resistance keeps the drive protected from the elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EZv88J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10257048"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OqXZ28"&gt;Yeah, gaming keyboards are cool, but what about ergonomics? The Microsoft Sculpt keyboard combo typically hovers around $100 but is currently available for $80 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUybZYyYRs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Ergonomic-Wireless-Desktop-Keyboard/dp/B00CYX54C0/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This bundle includes the wrist-friendly Sculpt keyboard that features a split layout and a number of adjustment options to accommodate a variety of desk layouts. The bundle also comes with a wireless number pad, a welcome addition for anyone who lives in spreadsheets. Finally, the bundle includes a rounded mouse that meets somewhere between conventional mouse designs and vertical, ergonomically friendly models. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s new mobile homescreen makes it easier to jump back to pages you’ve recently visited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rOfPYJofQ88gskq3TZNmGEujYlg=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70078678/Untitled_1.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Part of Firefox’s new mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mozilla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qJN2fq"&gt;Mozilla is updating the homescreen on its Firefox mobile apps to help you more easily jump back to pages you had viewed recently. With Firefox 94, which will be available Tuesday, you’ll be able to see things like your last open tab, recently-viewed bookmarks, and recent searches grouped by topic right on the mobile homescreen. You can get an idea of what it looks like in this image from Mozilla:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h47cQnpUGKcDqk8EmInS14Oab8w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22977842/Untitled.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Firefox mobile homescreen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKQcuX"&gt;Firefox 94 is also giving Android users the ability to tailor Pocket recommendations that show up on the homescreen by selecting different story topics they are interested in. According to a screenshot shared by Mozilla, topics include things like technology, health, food, and science. This feature isn’t yet available for iOS users, Mozilla says, though they will still see be able to see Pocket recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kGLzqcdmX5hla10YQ1a6LONgdR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22979055/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are some of the Pocket story topics you can pick from.&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B5ToY8"&gt;The desktop version of Firefox 94 brings some updates, too, including 18 new themes you can use to customize the way the browser looks for you.&lt;/p&gt;
