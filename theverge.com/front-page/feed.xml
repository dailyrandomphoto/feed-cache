  &lt;p&gt;Help your loved ones stay healthy and happy with gifts suitable for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c6YEGG"&gt;There’s nothing quite like a global pandemic to remind you how true that old cliché is: at the end of the day, health really is wealth. During these past two years, however, emotional wellness has become just as important as physical health, making gifts that focus on our mental wellbeing just as meaningful as those that impact our physical one. Luckily, our gift guide features a range of ideas that should appeal to both, many of which were solicited from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;staff and can still arrive on time even if the holidays are nearly here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Io2XdI"&gt;Below, you’ll find an under-desk elliptical for the friend who finds making time to go to the gym challenging, as well as the latest Apple Watch, the third-gen Oura Ring, and a pair of sunglasses that let you ditch your earbuds at home. We’ve also included gift cards for popular therapy and meditation services — perfect for those of us who waited until the last minute to start shopping — along with gifts that should also work well with any budget. Take a look and see what great stuff you can get to help your family and friends stay healthy and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft is remaking the original Splinter Cell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4g_JF_Wd_mS9rWNGlZ3kqLca8A=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277721/ECHOReveal_FINAL_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just don’t put NFTs in it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mgbcF9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto"&gt;Ubisoft announced&lt;/a&gt; that a remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt; is in the works, and it’s promising to both keep the stealthy spirit of the 2002 game while making it comfortable to play for modern gamers. It’s being developed by Ubisoft Toronto, and the company says it’ll use the Snowdrop engine it co-developed (and has &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fsnowdrop%2Fgames&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used in games&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;The Division&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario + Rabbids&lt;/em&gt;) to take advantage of the tech offered by new consoles&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04qnu0"&gt;According to Ubisoft’s announcement post, the remake won’t go open-world. Instead, there’ll be linear levels where “every square inch is part of a choice, or directly offers a choice.” The team working on the game has also said that it’ll have updated visuals (a good call, since the original came out almost two decades ago), as well as tweaks to “some of the design elements” to make the game “match player comfort and expectations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2bYCfe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s still very early days for the game, but it has been greenlit (ha)&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11tAr2"&gt;While the initial response from fans seems to be cautiously optimistic (with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guttapunks/status/1471164158418825217?s=20"&gt;some pleas&lt;/a&gt; for Ubisoft to not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;ruin the game with NFTs&lt;/a&gt;), it’s not time to start holding your breath for a release date; in its Q&amp;amp;A, one of the game’s producers says that it’s currently “in the very earliest stages of development.” Given that Ubisoft’s promotional material for the game currently has “now hiring” plastered all over it, it seems like it could be a bit before the team is even assembled to fully start working on the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbOHth"&gt;Ubisoft Toronto isn’t a stranger to &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt; — the last game in the franchise, 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Blacklist,&lt;/em&gt; was the first game the studio shipped. Since then, it’s worked on games like &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJXUZB"&gt;If you’re looking for a crash course on the original &lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;, Ubisoft has put out a video with some of the team behind it and the remake discussing what they felt was special about the game when it first came out. You can watch it below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC proposes new rules to make emergency alerts more accessible for people hard of hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i94doAsYpq89ppveOwccmfhrSu0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277718/acastro__171016_1777_0001_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FCC wants to update its emergency alert system | Illustrator by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6R7ap"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-seeks-improve-accessibility-clarity-emergency-alerts"&gt;proposing new rules&lt;/a&gt; for emergency alerts to make them more accessible to people who are deaf and hard of hearing. The agency said in a news release that the proposal is part of a larger examination of measures to “enhance the system’s overall functionality and accessibility.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaLv6O"&gt;The legacy versions of emergency alerts broadcast on over-the-air television with a test pattern screen and a loud alert noise followed by spoken instructions. The FCC says it wants broadcasters, cable systems, and other participants in the emergency alerts system (EAS) to use the internet-based Common Alerting Protocol version of the alerts when possible instead. And for the TV alerts, the FCC wants to see improvements to “the clarity and descriptiveness” of visuals that appear on TVs during EAS tests, for people who can’t hear the tests’ audio messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="outstreamPlayer-inArticle"&gt;FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement that it’s difficult to know what kind of warning is adequate when “freak weather” occurs, like the deadly tornadoes that moved through the Midwest last week. “But we do know that we are seeing these kinds of storms with greater frequency,” Rosenworcel said. “And I think we have a responsibility to improve the warning systems we have, to get people the news they need in an emergency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cYUBn"&gt;Rosenworcel and the other FCC commissioners all support the proposed changes to EAS warnings. In June, the commission combined Presidential Alerts and alerts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/20/22542541/fcc-updates-emergency-alerts-phones-fema"&gt;into one National Alerts category&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM teases upcoming GMC Sierra Denali electric pickup truck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TA4xyQL7aOfh-M3zMOF6C_3S3p0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277439/GMC_Electric_Sierra_Denali.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKnUzu"&gt;The GMC Sierra Denali full-size pickup truck is going electric. The automaker teased the first image of the upcoming EV much in the same way it did with the Hummer EV truck — by only showing off its front end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SWNXma"&gt;The square-shaped nose of the truck is set off by L-shaped headlights and an illuminated logo in the middle. The massive grille on the gas equivalent has been smoothed out — a clear indication there is no internal combustion engine under this hood in need of cooling. And it appears we’ll be getting some sort of lighting system that indicates when the vehicle is charging, much like the Hummer EV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4dkaZq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yM1fyw"&gt;Other than that, details are slim. The electric Sierra will only be available in GMC’s popular Denali trim, it will run on GM’s Ultium electric vehicle battery platform, and it will be assembled at GM’s Factory Zero in Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan. The truck will be unveiled next year but won’t go into production likely until early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826236/chevy-silverado-ev-truck-production-sale-date"&gt;much like the Chevy Silverado EV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="guqn7W"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M-CAUX8ESpM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTEBeA"&gt;The Silverado will make its public debut on January 5th at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. When it comes out, it will be one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger $35 billion push into electric vehicles, as well as the first electric truck for the automaker’s Chevy brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNvbJg"&gt;But when they inevitably hit dealerships, both the Silverado and Sierra Denali will find the market fairly crowded. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;Rivian R1T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt; are expected to reach customers in greater numbers in 2022. GM’s electric truck production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning, which is expected to start in spring 2022. (Ford recently shut down reservations for the F-150 Lightning after receiving nearly 200,000 orders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I95ufW"&gt;The Sierra is one of GMC’s most popular trucks, with sales increasing 40 percent year over year in the second quarter of 2021. It’s also one of the automaker’s largest and most dangerously designed trucks, with a high hood and square-shaped front end that increases the size of the vehicle’s front blindspot. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21065319/suv-truck-front-blindspot-children-injury-death-wthr-13"&gt;Trucks with larger bodies and higher carriages&lt;/a&gt; mean pedestrians are more likely to suffer deadly blows to the head and torso. And higher clearances mean victims are more likely to get trapped underneath a speeding truck instead of pushed onto the hood or off to the side. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Glass Sound Speaker review: it’s not what it looks like</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A mood-setting novelty speaker that doesn’t slouch on sound&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PjkZYO"&gt;Every so often, you get a reminder that Weird Sony is still alive and well. The company might be releasing best-in-class wireless earbuds, gorgeous OLED TVs, and premium soundbars, but it also still dabbles in unusual gadgets that stand no chance of appealing to a mass audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T8iiuS"&gt;It’s fair to say that the $350 LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is exactly that kind of product. A combined portable Bluetooth speaker and candlestick-like table lamp, the LSPX-S3 is by no means designed for the everyday consumer. It’s not supposed to be your rugged, take-anywhere speaker. It’s a statement piece that could add ambiance to a romantic dinner, a bedside table, or a meal outside on a summer evening. Sony sees enough in this concept to have kept at it for three generations now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YeRzh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10925485"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="epYQUI"&gt;The LSPX-S3 stands slightly over 11 inches tall and is heavier than it looks at 2.5 pounds, with most of that weight residing in the very sturdy-feeling silver metal base. The heft is reassuring in that there’s little risk of the device tipping over accidentally. You could say the Glass Sound Speaker gives off futuristic oil lamp vibes, maybe, but most people I’ve shown it to have immediately concluded that it most closely resembles a bong. It’s certainly a conversation starter, but any potential appeal will come down to your own taste. To me, this looks like a speaker that belongs in a lake cabin or an art studio. It might feel a little out of place in some contexts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ES_3WS1VP8SAWYkwXSU0VzX4i8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085918/cwelch_211213_4926_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LSPX-S3 produces warm ambient light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEOwSA"&gt;Around back, near the bottom of the base, you’ll find a USB-C port for charging the battery and buttons for power, answering a phone call, and controlling the volume. Sony includes a short USB-C to USB-A cable in the box but no power adapter. Under the speaker are additional buttons for Bluetooth pairing and setting a sleep timer. On Android, the LSPX-S3 supports Fast Pair for easy setup. Perhaps most surprising is that Sony also includes its higher-quality LDAC codec among the speaker’s features, allowing you to play music at higher bitrates from services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Tidal, Qobuz, and others that offer lossless audio. LDAC might seem like overkill for a speaker of this relatively small size, but I’m glad to see Sony extending it to more products — especially considering the price premium of this one. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-KYbEccC9BmHmvW-xv6LzphOMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085921/cwelch_211213_4926_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The buttons are located at the back of the speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHiJsk"&gt;The glass tube isn’t there purely for aesthetics. According to Sony, three actuators in the speaker are attached to the end of the glass and vibrate the entire glass tweeter when audio is playing “to spread sound in every direction.” And if you’re holding the LSPX-S3 in your hands, it really can sometimes seem like the sound is originating from the tube rather than the base beneath it. But I can’t overlook that there’s an inherent fragility to this design that isn’t present with other portable speakers made from more durable materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eODDn1"&gt;You can adjust the brightness of the LED but not the color temperature; it’s meant to always mimic the warmth of candlelight. The first mode lets you choose a fixed, consistent brightness by sliding your finger along a touch sensor on the back of the speaker. (There are 32 levels of brightness in all.) Switching over to candlelight mode makes the LED gently dim and illuminate like the flickering of a candle. You can also have the light pulse in sync with whatever music is being played, though this effect is more subtle than you might imagine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6lgHFr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It might be portable, but this isn’t a speaker you want to drop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dD1k6W"&gt;The LSPX-S3 plays the role of a candle well enough that its flickering would have you think it was the real thing if it was off to the side of a table during dinner. I found it pleasing, but you’d hope it could pull off that trick for the price Sony’s asking. Even at its highest brightness setting, you should only expect ambient lighting from the Glass Sound Speaker; it’s not some high-intensity household lamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UebqF1"&gt;So it does the job as a candle replacement, but how does it rank as a speaker? Better than I expected before I turned it on, honestly. Sound is distributed evenly in all directions, and the LSPX-S3 has enough power to fill small rooms with tunes. Where this speaker really shines is in its upper register. Acoustic guitars, other string instruments, and brass all come through with a fantastic, crisp clarity — and the same holds true for vocals. That’s where the glass tweeter really makes a difference. There’s no muddiness whatsoever to the sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JDjN5HOt5FBVbVaWUULb8qRhhBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23087698/thelamp.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LED can flicker to convincingly mimic candlelight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vazuft"&gt;That said, the speaker is limited by its size and the space constraints that Sony faced when filling it with driver components. The soundstage isn’t all that wide, and this means that some genres (acoustic, classical, jazz, etc.) are better suited to get the most out of this speaker than others like rock, pop, electronic, or hip hop. Having just seen them in Brooklyn a few weeks ago, I’ve been on a Hold Steady kick, and the LSPX-S3 doesn’t have quite enough presence to make their records shine. The keyboard and other instrumentation can get drowned out in the cramped mix output. Bass isn’t going to rattle surfaces, but Sony does include a bass boost toggle in its mobile app if you want to crank that part of the EQ as much as possible. Sony’s glass speaker has more clarity to it than many Bluetooth speakers, but bigger units can definitely outperform it on the boom factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npOyeu"&gt;You’ll get up to eight hours of battery life from the speaker on a charge, which seems perfectly sufficient for its indoor or backyard use cases. This isn’t the kind of product you’ll be taking on the road, so it doesn’t exactly need to match the 15-hour battery of a UE Boom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IipKpqfrUS1mWmm-sgWyBfUNiHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23085919/cwelch_211213_4926_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glass tube helps the speaker’s treble performance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5FAxU"&gt;For whatever good traits it has, the LSPX-S3 is unfortunately missing a lot. There are volume buttons but inexplicably no play / pause or track controls. (The buttons are also located on the back, which is nice for looks but more of a hassle for usability.) This speaker lacks any voice control “smarts.” It only does playback over Bluetooth and not Wi-Fi, leaving out features like Apple’s AirPlay 2, Google Cast, or Spotify Connect. You can group two glass speakers together as a stereo pair, but I can’t in good conscience recommend that anyone burn $700 on that proposition: you can do tons better for the money by sticking with more traditional speakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="AIfyCN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10925510"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="e7LebM"&gt;But that brings us back to this being a Weird Sony product that isn’t aimed at someone shopping for a “normal” Bluetooth speaker. Sony itself sells plenty of those for less money, as do brands like Ultimate Ears, JBL, Bose, and countless others. The LSPX-S3 Glass Sound Speaker is one of a kind, and its candlelight-mimicking capabilities make it the best execution of this concept so far. That doesn’t mean I’d buy it, but if you’re itching to put this thing in your dining room or in a getaway cabin, there’s nothing wrong with getting lavish and weird sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Spruce up your digs with some clever gadgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nmh7YT"&gt;Home is what you make it, so why not make it as awesome as possible? Sometimes, that can be done by just hanging up a sentimental photo in a frame or spritzing things up occasionally with some flowers or a new piece of furniture. Every now and again, however, you just need to gift yourself some crafty home tech goodies or buy them for someone you care about. Not every item in the list below has a circuit board built into it — though many of them do; instead, what ties them all together is that, in small ways, they’ll make your home look better and operate more smoothly, and perhaps let you relax a little more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPlj3d"&gt;We’ve consulted the minds at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for their ideas, and what follows are a couple of dozen gift ideas for anyone who’s looking to liven up their abode with some clever home tech. From an affordable robot vacuum and smart lighting to a 4K TV that moonlights as a Monet when not in use, there’s something for everyone on our list. In fact, in an effort to appeal to even more people (and in time for the holidays), we’ve added a couple of more options, specifically the Abode Cam 2 and Amazon’s excellent Smart Thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest indie announcements include Chicory and Omori on the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bigkG27vuYCKJduM-izq6GUE0eM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277360/ss_2f643ac851b504a1c10e0b6f1cfdc3089707ab55.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chicory: A Colorful Tale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cPzxVU"&gt;Nintendo closed out the year with its final Indie World Showcase, and the 20-minute-long event revealed a nice mix of games coming to the Switch, including a handful of surprises. We got new looks at previously announced games like Sea of Stars and OlliOlli World, as well as Switch ports for celebrated indies like &lt;em&gt;Chicory: A Colorful Tale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Omori. &lt;/em&gt;Some of the games are even launching today. Here are the biggest announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m7LxBDPAthtRtehC3eZymeklmFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098197/ss_387be51b4d818affe0d52866b01790e40910e3ac.jpg"&gt;

&lt;h3 id="K621dF"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Chicory&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Dungeon Munchies&lt;/em&gt;, and more are out today&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rHHFZI"&gt;The Nintendo eShop is getting a handful of new titles today, including the much-requested Switch port of the beautiful painting adventure &lt;em&gt;Chicory&lt;/em&gt;. Also coming today: &lt;em&gt;Dungeon Munchies&lt;/em&gt;, an action game about hunting monsters and then eating them; &lt;em&gt;Timelie&lt;/em&gt;, a stealth puzzle game where you control time; and &lt;em&gt;Let’s Play! Oink Games, &lt;/em&gt;a collection of card and board games from Oink Games, which features local and online play.&lt;/p&gt;

The latest trailer shows off its beautiful world, along with a soundtrack from none other than Yasunori Mitsuda, best known for the scores from &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Chrono Cross&lt;/em&gt;. It’s slated to hit the Switch (along with PC and other consoles) late next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="1zABlz"&gt;Easily the saddest-looking game at today’s showcase, &lt;em&gt;Endling&lt;/em&gt; puts you in the role of the last fox who must protect her three cubs in a world ravaged by humans. If that doesn’t sound bleak enough, the stealth adventure has another twist: depending on your choices, the cubs might not all make it to the end.

&lt;em&gt;Omori &lt;/em&gt;is coming to the Switch, along with a handful of other story-driven games&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uAdBvY"&gt;Nintendo closed out the show by revealing that acclaimed indie RPG &lt;em&gt;Omori&lt;/em&gt;, which originally debuted on the PC last year, will be hitting the Switch in the spring. Before that, we got looks at several interesting-looking story-driven games. That includes &lt;em&gt;Loco Motive&lt;/em&gt;, a classic point-and-click adventure that is, as the name implies, a murder mystery set on a train (out next summer); and &lt;em&gt;Afterlove EP&lt;/em&gt;, the next release from the creatives of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134502/coffee-talk-game-review-nintendo-switch-ps4-xbox-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coffee Talk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (out next summer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="3SJuL2"&gt;Two very different takes on co-op play&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wfUvDX"&gt;If you’re looking for some co-op action, a few good options were revealed at the showcase. &lt;em&gt;Aliisha: The Oblivion of Twin Goddesses&lt;/em&gt; is a two-player adventure where two sisters must work together to solve puzzles; it’s due out next spring. On the other end of the spectrum is &lt;em&gt;River City Girls 2&lt;/em&gt;, a classic beat ‘em up that you can play solo, but which is almost certainly more fun with a friend. It features both local and online play and launches on the Switch next summer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s Concept Stanza converts your chicken scratch to digital text</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A worker holds the Dell Concept Stanza in their left hand in portrait mode at a white marble table in a cafe setting. On the screen are some drawings and notes. In their right hand is a black stylus." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oW0lH-srKEIieThxb6c_FZ5tdx4=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277284/Concept_Stanza___lifestyle_image___over_shoulder___embargoed_until_Dec_15.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is.&lt;/em&gt; | Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar234k"&gt;Dell has shown off a new concept device that (let’s be honest) may never actually come out — but it’s a lot of fun to play with. The Concept Stanza is an 11-inch tablet that’s meant to simplify the process of taking notes at work. The idea is that if you write on the Stanza and then double tap your notes, they’ll be instantly converted to digital text. Connect it to a computer, and your notes will show up on the big screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSK333"&gt;Now, this is obviously not a revolutionary use case — devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Notes&lt;/a&gt; can convert handwritten notes to digital ones already. But the big difference with the Stanza is that it’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;for writing — there are no cameras, speakers, or ports on the device, in an effort to create what Dell describes as a “distraction-free experience.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dy6yaj"&gt;Dell’s tablet can also recognize more than letters. You can draw a line through text to delete it and can theoretically digitize shapes (such as Venn diagrams) as well. Separately, the Stanza can serve as an external monitor to extend your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell Concept Stanza mounted horizontally on a stand with the stylus magnetically attached to the top, on a desk with a cup of pens and a row of notebooks in the background. The screen displays BioFrame 2.0 software." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7PymGJgdq4gVXkxZTmeWfXHeI2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23098700/Concept_Stanza___docked___embargoed_until_Dec_15.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s the stylus, magnetically attached.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRfjb9"&gt;I got to try the Stanza out for a few brief minutes. It was a comfortable writing experience — the stylus is compact and the tablet’s screen is smooth. The device correctly interpreted all of my (fairly messy) writing. In English, that is — though we were told that the device is supposed to support a whole bunch of languages, I tried writing some things in Chinese and Korean characters that it did not recognize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EsY8B"&gt;So, work in progress. Since the Stanza is still in the concept stage, there’s no pricing and availability yet, and no guarantee that it’s going to become a real thing you can buy. But it could certainly be a nifty tool for boardroom and classroom use. It’s the rare concept device that I think seems pretty ready to go — though I hope it figures out how to do multiple languages at once. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HDmuh6"&gt;I didn’t think I’d spend the first two hours of my morning listening to people place orders at an imaginary McDonald’s drive-thru. And yet that’s exactly what I did thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verge"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; Spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXNISQ"&gt;Twitter user Julee, whose handle is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit"&gt;@thequeensbit&lt;/a&gt;, spent hours roleplaying as a McDonald’s cashier to an audience of thousands of listeners. At the time I joined the conversation, she was on hour 13 with more than 1,700 people tuned in. She approved one user to speak at a time as the customer. The customer would then put in their order, often incorrectly, or make absurd requests for food that’s not on the menu. One person asked for “the cookies, and put it in milk in a bowl.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mLbStb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;welcome to mcdonald’s may i take ur order ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa"&gt;https://t.co/ujJThBCPOa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— julee (@thequeensbit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thequeensbit/status/1470914796925165573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hYfrzy"&gt;Julee almost always goes along with the bit even though that’s led her into some strange storylines of handing out bags of fries, selling marijuana with orders, or sorting out drama between customers and other “employees.” One customer asked for a “Sprite, extra spicy,” and “a bag just filled with BTS sauce.” Julee happily obliged. Another asked her to put a Big Mac through a paper shredder to make the meat more akin to Arby’s roast beef. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xSFbT"&gt;After nearly two hours of listening, I’ve heard customers threaten robbery, order cuisines not normally served at McDonald’s, cry over spouses who have left them, and complain about the several-hour line that exists outside of this nonexistent McDonald’s. For the most part, people seem committed to the bit. Julee is the one to break character the most, lamenting her missed therapy appointment or spending a moment celebrating the length of time the Space has continued going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7j3s1V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Next level performance Art   &lt;a href="https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i"&gt;https://t.co/nD6yhpfC4i&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— jason@calacanis.com (@Jason) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jason/status/1471044669639311362?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5LiWtd"&gt;What made this Space so captivating is, frankly, its weirdness. Many of Twitter’s live audio rooms are hosted by journalists or business leaders who want to speak with others in their industry about niche or newsworthy topics. Yet Julee has captivated an audience of over 1,000 listeners by playing pretend. While this is outside of the norm for Twitter Spaces, some strange rooms have popped up on Clubhouse, too, like people roleplaying a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;VIPs-only Mansion Party&lt;/a&gt; or, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3vd7y/inside-the-clubhouse-room-where-people-moan-like-whales"&gt;pretending to be whales&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBcjVD"&gt;The Space promised to be a 24-hour drive-thru, but unfortunately it shut down this morning — apparently it crashed — sometime around the 15-hour mark. It was a welcome distraction while it lasted. This Space could be a one-off created by a hilarious user, or it could be a sign that Clubhouse’s roleplay culture may be bleeding over into Twitter. Even if that sign is shaped like McDonald’s iconic golden arches.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple scrubs controversial CSAM detection feature from webpage but says plans haven’t changed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE4bW86HfAYrTlwzmeUDjm5YN-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70277130/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="08LtgO"&gt;Apple has updated a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;webpage on its child safety features&lt;/a&gt; to remove all references to the controversial child sexual abuse material (CSAM) detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611305/apple-scan-photos-iphones-icloud-child-abuse-imagery-neuralmatch"&gt;first announced in August&lt;/a&gt;. The change, which was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/apple-nixes-csam-references-website/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, appears to have taken place some time &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211210163051/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;between December 10th&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211213213636/https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;December 13th&lt;/a&gt;. But despite the change to its website, the company says its plans for the feature haven’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkMs8A"&gt;Two of the three safety features, which released earlier this week with iOS 15.2, are still present on the page, which is titled “Expanded Protections for Children.” However references to the more controversial CSAM detection, whose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;launch was delayed&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from privacy advocates, have been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7KASm"&gt;When reached for comment, Apple spokesperson Shane Bauer said that the company’s position hasn’t changed since September, when it first announced it would be delaying the launch of the CSAM detection. “Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers, and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features,” the company’s September statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWxRtC"&gt;Crucially, Apple’s statement does not say the feature has been canceled entirely. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf"&gt;Documents&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf"&gt;outlining&lt;/a&gt; how the functionality works are still live on Apple’s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x2oxlg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s controversial new child protection features, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="7BX0L3"&gt;Apple’s CSAM detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613365/apple-icloud-csam-scanning-whatsapp-surveillance-reactions"&gt;was controversial&lt;/a&gt; when it was announced because it involves taking hashes of iCloud Photos and comparing them to a database of hashes of known child sexual abuse imagery. Apple claims this approach allows it to report users to the authorities if they’re known to be uploading child abuse imagery without compromising the privacy of its customers more generally. It also says the encryption of user data is not affected and that the analysis be run on-device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9fFJg"&gt;But critics argue that Apple’s system risks undermining Apple’s end-to-end encryption. Some referred to the system as a “backdoor” that governments around the world might strong-arm Apple into expanding into including content beyond CSAM. For its part, Apple has said that it will “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616381/apple-child-sexual-abuse-material-scanning-icloud-faq-pushback-privacy"&gt;not accede to any government’s request to expand it&lt;/a&gt;” beyond CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcz1P8"&gt;While the CSAM detection feature has yet to receive a new launch date, Apple has gone on to release two of the other child-protection features it announced in August. One is designed to warn children when they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776028/ios-15-2-beta-communication-safety-messages-children-sexually-explicit-nudity-scan-notifications"&gt;receive images containing nudity in Messages&lt;/a&gt;, while the second provides additional information when searching for terms related to child exploitation through Siri, Spotlight, or Safari Search. Both rolled out with iOS 15.2, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22828226/apple-ios-15-2-iphone-update-digital-legacy-music-macro-app-privacy"&gt;released earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; and which appears to have prompted Apple to update its webpage. &lt;/p&gt;
