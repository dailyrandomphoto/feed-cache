    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;preorder one of the recently announced Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tA5jd3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Right now, there aren’t deals available on the 38mm Series 3, which is only available for its standard price of $199 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYnqufKYm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1161528/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101052%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000087521670%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0064R00001AFOp3QAH-Apple_GoogleSearch_AO_Q4_FY21_AO%26adgroup%3DPLA_Apple%2BAirTag%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9004339%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtfqKBhBoEiwAZuesiJUi6dcVJIyvV2yp8_t07QEQXzMl8yEsT1GQ2bYjHatSoPfkIJXtHxoC6DAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. For that price, you might as well spring for the larger, 42mm configuration; both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version in white at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/1143052/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_zLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DzLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $275 — a minor $4 discount — or for full price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYfu2GpGW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the red and blue models are both seeing a steep discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with both retailing for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the pink (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1149510/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F683927568&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A9987250&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=9987250" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5SQ3MG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and white models (&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5V1YWL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), are available for $415 at the same retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and YouTube will cut off ad money for climate change deniers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TFjnh6ir5kwdKu91SpykoqB3Ac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965820/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoHg1u"&gt;Google will no longer allow advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators to monetize content that denies the existence of climate change. The company detailed the changes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOxbM6"&gt;“Today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” the Google Ads team said in the document. “This includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3ybf"&gt;Google says it will use a mix of automated tools and human reviews to enforce the policy. “When evaluating content against this new policy, we’ll look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim,” Google said. Ads will still be allowed on climate topics like public debates on climate policy, research, and more, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWCsgW"&gt;The increased action against climate change deniers marks Google’s second big misinformation policy change in recent days, arriving about a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700171/youtube-vaccine-misinformation-antivax-ban"&gt;YouTube banned vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It follows new features announced by the search giant intended to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711623/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-footprint-maps-search-travel"&gt;shrink their carbon footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Phil Lord and Chris Miller’s next project is a murder mystery for Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLhzBaN9EzPTC-Qn98sr5yr3GCU=/67x0:1795x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965572/Screen_Shot_2021_10_07_at_11.45.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0xCARw"&gt;Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the producers behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the writer-directors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/10/5396322/the-lego-movie-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are bringing their talents to Apple TV Plus. &lt;em&gt;The Afterparty&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-reveals-first-look-teaser-of-highly-anticipated-murder-mystery-comedy-series-the-afterparty-ahead-of-january-2022-debut-on-apple-tv/"&gt;a new eight-part murder-mystery comedy series&lt;/a&gt; created and directed by Miller, with both Lord and Miller serving as showrunners and executive producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OIwlr"&gt;The new series “centers on a murder mystery at a high school reunion,” Apple says, with each episode featuring “a retelling of the same night told through a different character’s perspective, each with its own unique visual style and film genre to match the teller’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IBgSf"&gt;The show stars Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Ben Schwartz, and Ilana Glazer, among several other comedy stars (and apparently Dave Franco). It’s hard to get a real sense of the details of the plot based off this first trailer (Haddish is investigating the murder?), but the premise and cast are certainly promising. Plus, stories with equally vague premises — &lt;em&gt;Game Night&lt;/em&gt; starts as &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/02/game-night-review.html"&gt;a movie about people playing board games&lt;/a&gt; before it gets wacky — have historically allowed for plenty of shocking twists and humorous setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlutM4"&gt;Lord and Miller have another streaming project in the works as well. In February 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276330/hbo-max-clone-high-animated-series-season-2"&gt;HBO Max announced&lt;/a&gt; it was reviving Lord, Miller, and Bill Lawrence’s animated show &lt;em&gt;Clone High&lt;/em&gt; for the streaming service. Apple already has a successful working relationship with Lawrence, who’s a co-creator of its &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/09/emmys-2021-winners-full-list.html"&gt;Emmy-winning comedy &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25MU7v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Afterparty &lt;/em&gt;will premiere globally on Apple TV Plus in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LRWzWu"&gt;Facebook has announced a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/expanding-horizon-new-funding-to-support-creators/"&gt;$10 million Creator Fund&lt;/a&gt; to encourage people to build experiences on its Horizon VR platform, which it is now calling &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Ffacebook-horizon%2Fsign-up%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. Although Horizon Worlds is still in beta, the company clearly wants to get more people making content for the platform to offer more experiences that could be interesting to users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEEVwY"&gt;The funds will be given out “over the next year” in three main buckets:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="PoHoE8"&gt;A series of community competitions to build “the very best worlds in Horizon.” Facebook will give up to $10,000 in cash for the top three entrants in the competitions. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="82dbYN"&gt;A Creator Accelerator Program that’s “designed to give people from diverse backgrounds an advanced crash course in Horizon Worlds creation.” Facebook finished a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Finside-the-facebook-horizon-creator-accelerator-program%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pilot of the program in September&lt;/a&gt; and will accept applications in November for the next iteration of the program, which will launch in “early” 2022.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cLAIEl"&gt;Funding for developers who are interested in making “experiences for Horizon in a particular theme.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div id="pLTGkY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PwVV-zczHYI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=2&amp;amp;start=2" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAZTmh"&gt;The Creator Fund could help Facebook in its big bet on virtual worlds. The company has invested heavily in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus VR headsets&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;and ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said he wants people to eventually see Facebook as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;“a metaverse company.”&lt;/a&gt; One example of what that could look like is Facebook’s Horizons Workrooms app, which is designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;be a VR meeting room for work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTSLHj"&gt;But as Facebook is racing to build out Horizon Worlds and get people to create content for it, it faces stiff competition from other metaverse makers like Epic Games (the developer of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;) and Roblox — which both also rely heavily on user-created content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkQdQj"&gt;While Facebook’s Creator Fund is a positive step toward ensuring creators get paid for building virtual experiences, I’m hoping the company invests significantly more in creators down the line. I suspect it has the ability to; the $10 million put toward the fund is a drop in the bucket compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598592/facebook-second-quarter-earnings-29-billion"&gt;more than $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; Facebook earned in profit in its second quarter. Otherwise, Horizons could turn into yet another platform where creators are fighting for scraps while its owner reaps the rewards.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder and Lyft partner so you can send your match a ride for an IRL date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yysrEaM3S5W7IxREyx-nzOrVr0o=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965450/lyft_tinder.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lyft and Tinder have partnered to offer free rides | Tinder&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqk1lB"&gt;Dating app Tinder and ride-hailing company Lyft are partnering on a new feature that lets Tinder members buy a Lyft ride for a potential date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345181/tinder-lyft-gift-ride-date"&gt;Tinder first teased&lt;/a&gt; the new feature in March and is now rolling it out to its subscribers as a way to “get back to making IRL connections.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSP67f"&gt;Tinder members can access the Lyft integration from a new Explore section of Tinder’s app, where they can buy a Lyft ride credit for a person they’ve matched with. The person buying the credit doesn’t get any details about the recipient's address but can set the location, time, and value of the credit they want to purchase. Then, the recipient gets a link via either a phone number or email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXlTyl"&gt;Tinder calls the feature a “thoughtful gesture while promoting personal safety for those ready to ‘get back out there’ after way too many months inside.” It’s a totally optional feature, and members don’t have to accept any gifted ride, the company stresses, but there doesn’t appear to be a way to opt out of the feature altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5GsjPP"&gt;The sender can choose a one-way or roundtrip ride and will get a refund if the recipient doesn’t use the Lyft ride or only uses part of it. Both sender and recipient need to have Lyft accounts to participate; if the recipient doesn’t have one at the time they get the link, they can create one at that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4o0Bk2"&gt;Of course, there are ways that the feature could be misused, like say, in an &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-guadalupe-gonzales-pleads-not-guilty-dine-and-dash-dating-allegations-2018-09-08/"&gt;elaborate dine-and-dash&lt;/a&gt; scheme, or if you really want a free Lyft ride and trick someone into giving you one for a date you don’t show up for, but those are sort of the pitfalls of dating in the digital age and aren’t exclusive to any one dating app. And, of course, you can always just swipe left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeTsFz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Psnqxj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gbV6r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnhvPF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QUWPU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Epic v. Apple, a small developer is challenging Apple’s in-app payment system</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UeFc9jFJLY4cnxUseni-LlaPZVE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965414/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZdlTDs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671574/epic-apple-app-store-new-rules-meaning-ruling-decision"&gt;The ambiguous finish to the Epic v. Apple trial&lt;/a&gt; opened a tiny crack in Apple’s control over in-app payments on the iPhone — and now, a small developer is trying to crawl through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbM0H1"&gt;A company called Paddle &lt;a href="https://paddle.com/platform/in-app-purchase/"&gt;has announced its own in-app payment system&lt;/a&gt; that will take a smaller cut than Apple’s system — 5 to 10 percent, instead of the 15 to 30 percent cut claimed by Apple. It’s a way around the commission fees that started the fight with Epic in the first place and likely to be the beginning of a new fight for developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90WU9S"&gt;Paddle’s system is designed to take advantage of the Epic v. Apple verdict, which required Apple to allow external payment links. Prior to the verdict, an App Store rule had banned “external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms” — but the judge found that rule violated anti-steering laws. Paddle’s system offers just such an external link, kicking users off to an outside page where they can pay before returning to the app. It definitely adds friction to the process, but it’s a far cry from the workarounds you’d have to go through if you wanted to skirt Apple’s IAP system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwLH1X"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment as to whether apps using the system would be allowed on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7u271vGlnNzBu4fInAkQ__BuzgE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22907920/iap_demo_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Paddle&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A demo of what a Paddle “in-app purchase” would look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rgTiqz"&gt;One of Paddle’s biggest selling points is its fees — Apple famously takes a 30 percent cut (or a 15 percent cut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150629/apple-small-business-program-app-store-reduced-commission-15-percent-developers"&gt;if you make less than $1 million on the App Store in a year&lt;/a&gt;) on in-app purchases for most developers. Paddle is offering a 10 percent cut on payments less than $10 and a 5 percent plus $0.50 charge on payments above $10. It’s not hard to see how switching from Apple’s payment system would be attractive for some developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdgWap"&gt;The real test will be seeing how apps that include Paddle’s payments fare during App Review. If Apple wants to find violations of its rules in apps using Paddle, it very likely will. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671736/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-case-ruling-appeal-decision"&gt;company has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to figure out how it can change its rules to comply with the judge’s order, but so far, the new rules haven’t been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCjjfm"&gt;Paddle told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an emailed statement that the company was waiting to see how the details of the ruling were implemented and that it’s built a few versions of its system to make it easier to adapt to whatever Apple’s rules end up being. It plans on launching its in-app payment service on December 7th, and the company’s CEO said that it “would welcome Apple’s view on this to bring more clarity.” Apple didn’t immediately respond to request for comment on Paddle’s plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPJs3q"&gt;You may also want to keep in mind the privacy implications of developers being able to communicate with users, as mentioned in the order — Paddle says that, unlike Apple, it’ll let developers see customers’ email addresses to help with billing support. While that comes with benefits (like developers &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/24/apple-in-app-refund-notification-changes/"&gt;actually getting to be involved in the refund process&lt;/a&gt;), you may want to keep in mind that you could be sharing your email address when you’re kicked over to a Paddle payment screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BzwNGG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will competition bring out the best in Apple, or will it prove the company right?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gmhwIy"&gt;Paddle also lists other benefits of its IAP platform, such as developers being able to price their app how they want without worrying if Apple will approve, the ability to set pricing on a country-by-country basis, and the ability to provide coupons. And, of course, the smaller cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYIXv0"&gt;With this being the first big challenge to Apple’s own IAP system since the ruling, it’s likely to attract a lot of attention (Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1446117510919585796?s=20"&gt;is already tweeting about it&lt;/a&gt;). Part of what makes the proposition so exciting is that, until this point, the arguments for either side have been mostly theoretical. If a competing in-app purchase system really does start making it to apps, and it takes off, we’ll get to see whether the competition will make Apple’s service better, as some developers have argued, or if it will lead to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;even worse proliferation of scams&lt;/a&gt;, where developers charge $100 a year for a weather app, as Apple has implied. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Game developer Eidos-Montréal is switching to a four-day workweek</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sP2eo1DSG5B6kduH2NM6mdIhZM=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965115/MGG_2021_06_14_scr_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Square Enix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Aa2OL3"&gt;Eidos-Montréal and its subsidiary Eidos-Sherbrooke are switching to a four-day workweek, the game developer &lt;a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/news/eidos-montreal-and-eidos-sherbrooke-shifting-to-the-4-day-work-week/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The Square Enix-owned company is currently working on the next big Marvel video game adaptation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22687700/guardians-of-the-galaxy-square-enix-action-rpg-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r02QjB"&gt;“This initiative is another step towards the embodiment of the studio’s values, building a healthy, creative, and sustainable work environment for our employees,” studio head David Anfossi writes in the company’s blog. “The idea is not to condense the working hours into four days, but rather to review our ways of doing things and our quality time invested, with the aim of working better!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8NjqAh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 32-hour workweek&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UbCSNX"&gt;Eidos-Montréal says that both studios will be closed on Fridays in the next few weeks, “without changing the working conditions currently in place nor the salaries of employees, thus switching from the 40-hour week to 32-hour.” The company isn’t entirely clear on how it plans to adapt to the new structure but suggests one change would be implementing shorter meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1daOHQ"&gt;Reexamining &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422518/google-hybrid-work-office-remote-work-sundar-pichai-memo-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;work schedules&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256060/twitter-employees-work-from-home-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;work-from-home policies&lt;/a&gt; have been a welcome change brought on by the pandemic. In the context of the video game industry, it’s notable because of how frequently employees are expected or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;forced to overwork themselves to hit deadlines&lt;/a&gt;. There’s no guarantee a shorter workweek will prevent crunch from happening, but it does at least bake in more time when workers can expect to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 2022 Geneva Motor Show is nixed thanks to COVID and the chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5G6MeUmVmxWMV5f4UkIH-VIUc4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69964983/koenigsegg_geneva19_vladsavov22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jb8jgG"&gt;The 2022 Geneva International Motor Show, slated to happen in February, has &lt;a href="https://www.gims.swiss/news/geneva-international-motor-show-postpones-create-more-impactful-event-2023"&gt;been canceled&lt;/a&gt; as the COVID pandemic persists and the auto industry struggles with a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuFzjY"&gt;Organizers said Thursday that there are still too many “uncertainties” related to the pandemic and the shortage for automakers to commit to the show, which usually serves as a showcase for wild supercars, concepts, and prototypes. The hope is to have “a more impactful show in 2023” with more virtual presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="585IEy"&gt;“We have pushed very hard and tried everything to reactivate the Geneva International Motor Show in 2022,” Maurice Turrettini, who runs the committee in charge of the show, said in a statement. “Despite all our efforts, we have to face the facts and the reality: the pandemic situation is not under control and presents itself as a big threat for a large indoor event like GIMS. But we see this decision as a postponement, rather than a cancellation. I am confident that the Geneva International Motor Show will come back stronger than ever in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ms2cG9"&gt;Sandro Mesquita, the CEO of the show, said the “chip crisis is likely to drag on well into next year, with negative financial implications for OEMs. In these uncertain times, many brands are therefore unable to make a commitment to participate in a trade fair that would have taken place in just over four months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OIoOz"&gt;The Geneva Motor Show was one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/28/21156368/geneva-motor-show-2020-canceled-coronavirus-concerns"&gt;first big auto shows to get scrapped in early 2020&lt;/a&gt; before the spread of the coronavirus had been officially labeled a pandemic. While a few have started back up again in recent months, the delta variant of the virus has forced organizers’ hands with events &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609757/new-york-auto-show-2021-canceled-delta-variant-covid"&gt;like the New York International Auto Show&lt;/a&gt;, which was canceled again in August. The Los Angeles Auto Show, set for mid-November, is &lt;a href="https://dot.la/la-auto-show-electric-vehicles-2655049301.html"&gt;still on track to happen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3NJpr"&gt;Sony Pictures Entertainment has released &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q6UGCyHZCI"&gt;a new trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City&lt;/em&gt;, the next live-action film based on the popular horror video game franchise, ahead of the movie’s November 24th release in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LLnC0"&gt;The movie, which is a reboot for the film side of the franchise, looks to be filled with &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; hallmarks. It takes place in Raccoon City, series mainstays Claire Redfield, Leon Kennedy, Jill Valentine, and Chris Redfield are all featured, something about the Umbrella Corporation is apparently at the heart of the conflict, and the main characters look like they will spend some time fleeing zombies in a spooky mansion. (There’s even a part in the trailer where a zombie dog shatters a window.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqIZtu"&gt;Here’s the official synopsis of the film, if you want to know a bit more about what to expect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="IWQ1BW"&gt;In RESIDENT EVIL: WELCOME TO RACCOON CITY, once the booming home of pharmaceutical giant Umbrella Corporation, Raccoon City is now a dying Midwestern town. The company’s exodus left the city a wasteland…with great evil brewing below the surface. When that evil is unleashed, a group of survivors must work together to uncover the truth behind Umbrella and make it through the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tno6iK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City &lt;/em&gt;caps what’s been a good year for &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; fans. Capcom released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;excellent &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; in May&lt;/a&gt;, and the TV series &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/em&gt; premiered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567062/resident-evil-infinite-darkness-review-netflix"&gt;on Netflix in July&lt;/a&gt;. And if you still have a hunger for more &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; content ahead of &lt;em&gt;Welcome to Raccoon City’s &lt;/em&gt;release, you can always watch &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(film_series)"&gt;one of the six other &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s the best student laptop? We asked students</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVcaADlGztrbR5iNL_kFd3rebG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67232292/akrales_200421_3975_0080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops for high school and college students.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tsQK0e"&gt;Shopping for a laptop can be stressful — doubly stressful if you or your children will be learning online for the first time. Kids of different ages have a range of different laptop use cases and different needs. And as the choices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; evolve, so do students’ needs. So I spoke to some experts on the subject: students themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9ZW8b"&gt;My recommendations here are meant to accommodate a variety of preferences and price ranges. But they’re a jumping-off point rather than an exhaustive list: every student is different. Before making a decision, you’ll want to make sure you read reviews and try out devices yourself if you can. I’ll do my best to keep this article up to date with items that are in stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Best laptop for students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;aside id="7m4BUq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best laptop you can buy ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"},{"title":"The best Chromebooks to buy in 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4lsvuf2NE7Upsw5uiVfjINO_Jhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19315989/vpavic_191023_3755_0159.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Pixelbook Go has solid battery life and a rippled base that’s easy to grip, making it a good choice for kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uaaUWw"&gt;Best laptop for elementary school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wdF0Hl"&gt;For younger students, a touchscreen device is easier to use than a keyboard and touchpad, says Michelle Glogovac. Glogovac’s five-year-old son uses an iPad for Webex meetings with his kindergarten class. He’s gotten the hang of it; Glogovac says he’s already learned how to mute and unmute himself, “a skill that many adults aren’t familiar with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEF087"&gt;That said, it may be worth investing in a keyboard case if you go the tablet route. Glogovac has to type her son’s meeting codes and passwords for him, which can be cumbersome on the iPad’s flat screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxdcbE"&gt;As kids get older, their best laptop choice will vary depending on their needs. As a parent, it’s important that you and your child are in sync about how they intend to use it and the size of the programs they want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sTP9p"&gt;Kristin Wallace purchased a budget HP laptop for her daughter, Bella, but didn’t realize how quickly the nine-year-old would fill up 32GB of storage. “It is really slow and has no space for games. I need a computer with more storage space,” said Bella, who uses the laptop to Zoom with friends and take virtual guitar lessons and math enrichment classes. Wallace plans to buy Bella a better device in the next few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwTXVL"&gt;Audio quality is an important consideration for kids’ laptops. Lisa Mitchell, an elementary library media specialist, says her students use their devices to watch YouTube videos in addition to their online classes. Battery life is also a plus, even for distance learners who may not be far from a wall outlet. Bella likes to use her laptop all around the house and doesn’t want to bring the cord with her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaeV8B"&gt;Durability is also worth paying for, according to Mitchell. If you’re using a tablet, get a protective case. “If a reasonably-priced insurance or replacement policy is available, it’s usually worth the extra expense.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is just $289, but it can run plenty of tabs and apps with no problem.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dE2ANJ"&gt;Best laptop for middle school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5kOKS"&gt;The middle school students I spoke to don’t use their laptops for much more than web-based schoolwork and browsing. Don’t be too concerned about power — prioritize a machine that’s comfortable and easy for your child to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9OvOd"&gt;“We just got the most basic Chromebook and it is totally perfect,” says Gabrielle Hartley, an &lt;a href="http://gabriellehartley.com/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attorney&lt;/a&gt; and mother of three children. “The most basic Chromebook serves all the needs of the basic middle schooler.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Acer Chromebook Spin 713." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0hMEh9WTjBjXAQF5Bh8xq8l2ng0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21698818/mchin_181029_4126_0017.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chromebooks, like this one from Acer, are a good choice for students who use Google Classroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fP2U74"&gt;Hartley’s son Max, who is in eighth grade, agrees. “I would really like a gaming PC or gaming laptop that can plug into a monitor and run video games with 120fps, but I really don’t need that,” Max says. “Most eighth graders aren’t going to be running any video games on their laptops or any software that requires a lot of power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpOfaD"&gt;Max mostly uses his laptop for Google Classroom applications, including Gmail, Slides, Google Docs, and Google Sheets. They’re very easy to use on his device, which he describes as “a run-of-the-mill Samsung Chromebook.” That said, if your child is starting middle school this year, it could be worth checking with their teachers to see what operating system is most compatible with their workflow. Caspian Fischer Odén, a ninth grader from Sweden, told me he has trouble with his Chromebook because his school has blocked downloading apps from the Google Play Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eUtDq"&gt;Even kids with more demanding hobbies think a budget device can get the job done. Sam Hickman, an eighth grader from the UK who uses his laptop for photo and video editing, says, “For most middle schoolers, any processor developed within the last two years will be able to handle any tasks they can throw at it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4fFLe"&gt;So, what &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;worth paying for? A comfortable keyboard, several students told me. Many middle school kids aren’t used to typing for long periods of time. You should also look for a device that’s compact and easy for them to carry around, particularly if they’re preparing for in-person school. Shoot for an 11- to 13-inch model — certainly nothing larger than 15 inches. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Laptop 4 is a capable, no-nonsense laptop — just what many high schoolers want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SKuVFA"&gt;Best laptop for high school&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OHE9ce"&gt;High schoolers’ laptop needs can vary based on their interests, but most don’t need powerful machines with lots of bells and whistles — especially if they come with glitches or serious downsides that could interfere with schoolwork. Miles Riehle, a student at Laguna Beach High School, has a high-end Surface Pro 7 but finds it overwhelming. “There is so much other stuff that I don’t use very often,” he said. “Something simpler might be a little more straightforward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toVK5y"&gt;The best operating system may depend on what your child is used to. Aryan Nambiar, a student at Barrington High School in Illinois, has an iMac at home and enjoys using an iPad for his schoolwork. Riehle says he would prefer a Chromebook because he has an Android phone and often uses Google services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="taD6O0"&gt;But almost every student I spoke to agreed that the most important feature of a high school laptop is portability. Kids attending in-person classes may be carrying their device around for much of the day with a stack of other books. Look for a 13- or 14-inch screen, or a lighter 15- to 17-inch model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9koeX"&gt;Students also recommend something sturdy. “Most high schoolers I’ve seen will throw their laptop in their bag without too much care,” says Moses Buckwalter, a student at Penn Manor High School. Backpacks can be jostled in the hallway as well. Kids can also run into trouble at home. “Anything can happen,” says Aadit Agrawal, a high school student from India. “My own brother scratched my laptop with his nails.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo7j0d"&gt;Battery life is another key feature. “It can be a real struggle to find a place to charge while in class,” says Cas Heemskerk, a sophomore from the Netherlands. Unlike college students, many high schoolers don’t have frequent breaks to juice up their devices, so try to find something that can last a full day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMbdD6"&gt;Many students recommend a touchscreen with stylus support. Nambiar uses the feature for his biology class, where he does a lot of visual modeling. “The touchscreen is always a bonus for drawing diagrams, whereas if you’re using a laptop it’d be a whole process to submit a diagram you drew,” Nambiar says. Riehle uses a Surface Pen to fill out school forms and annotate PDFs. Agrawal finds it useful to take notes on the same screen as his online lessons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7t3Wu"&gt;Depending on the broadband situation in your area, you may also want a laptop with multiple connectivity options. Agrawal’s online classes are sometimes interrupted by powercuts, so he recommends an LTE model. Matej Plavevski, a junior at Yahya Kemal College in North Macedonia, recommends looking for an Ethernet port in case slower connections disrupt meetings. That’s hard to find on smaller laptops, but there’s a slew of affordable dongles and docks to consider. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QKVW4e"&gt;Best laptop for college &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqoQtB"&gt;College kids are justified in spending a bit more money than other age groups. Some (especially in STEM courses) can expect to do some fairly demanding work. Assad Abid, an electrical engineering undergrad from Pakistan, needs to run simulation software for his assignments. Aakash Chandra, a student at New Horizon College of Engineering in India, does a lot of coding, in addition to creative work in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, and gaming. Students also noted that it’s worthwhile to pay for a laptop that will last for a few years after graduation. That means you won’t have to worry about finding and financing your next device until you’re (hopefully) settled into a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtiDo"&gt;But among high-end, capable devices there’s still a wide range of options. Students stressed that a college laptop should be light. Expect to bring it between classes, meals, meetings, the library, and other locations on campus. “It’s a boon that I can carry my laptop as well as some notebooks without feeling like I’m carrying too much for six hours a day,” says Haseeb Waseem, a senior at Villanova University. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 has a variety of configurations. Students with light workloads may prefer the base model, while gamers and creatives can add a GPU.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gsQLLb"&gt;Another universally-lauded feature: battery life. Waseem, who uses an HP Spectre, says the all-day juice gives him “the flexibility to study in a bunch of different locations, and even outside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PevA8"&gt;Speakers and webcams are often overlooked, even in top-end devices. But students say it’s worth looking for good ones if you’re starting college this year. Though many college students are now back to in-person classes, some will still be meeting with clubs and attending events online. Waseem isn’t satisfied with his laptop’s audio and picture quality, which he says has made it difficult to pay attention in class and to engage with other students.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqglEH"&gt;Many students will need to invest more in areas tailored to their interests and schoolwork needs. Chandra’s dream laptop would include a stylus and touchscreen for his creative work as well as a high-end GPU. Waseem, who uses his laptop for a hodgepodge of activities, including streaming, coding, social media, video chatting, and Microsoft Office work, would prefer to prioritize a large screen to keep track of his multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
