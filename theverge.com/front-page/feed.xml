    <title>The plus-size knitters who are solving an inclusivity problem</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7b6JDh"&gt;Fifteen years since first learning to knit, Petrina Hicks has only ever made sweaters for other people. There was one cardigan attempt back in 2015, but they had to make so many modifications that the end product was frumpy and ill-fitting. Hicks didn’t have the luxury to be picky: the cardigan was the only sweater pattern they could find above an XL or XXL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfCCaj"&gt;“I want to be a sweater maker,” Hicks said. “I couldn’t find things that were cute. I couldn’t find things that were in my style.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXtbHf"&gt;Hopeful crafters pick up knitting for a variety of reasons: to adopt a slow-fashion wardrobe, to keep &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-11/knitting-stress-relief-pandemic"&gt;stress at bay&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic, or to make the clothes they wish existed, controlling the color and fit to their liking. Ravelry, the largest knitting and crochet site, lists over a million designs — there’s no shortage of patterns to pick from. Unless a knitter happens to be plus size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0X43r"&gt;People falling outside of straight sizing (generally between extra-small and large) say that even when they want to make their own clothing, their options are limited or they’re outright excluded. But in the last few years, advocacy from within the knitting community — mostly in digital spaces, like Instagram networks — have sparked discussion and action around how to make the craft more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pVfrHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It took probably five minutes to map out the increases after I had my first set of numbers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4JUQG4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/gavriellamakes/"&gt;Gavriella Treminio&lt;/a&gt; is all about coziness. A knitter and designer based in Austin, Texas, Treminio favors simple, monochromatic knitwear, with &lt;a href="https://hellogavriella.myshopify.com/collections/knitting-patterns"&gt;interesting textures&lt;/a&gt; like eyelets and bobbles. Her most popular design, the Simone Pullover, goes up to a 5XL. A plus-size woman herself, Treminio says she wants everyone to feel included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="loXQVB"&gt;Knitwear design is equal parts art and math. After creating a sample garment, knitters calculate how the number of stitches at each section of the pattern will change for smaller or bigger sizes. Though it takes a bit of extra work, grading knitwear is typically repeating the same set of calculations. For many plus-size knitters, the size range a designer offers is indicative of how much time they were willing to put in to make their work accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwk4CS"&gt;For Treminio, it’s barely an extra effort. “I just don’t understand why some people feel that it takes more work to include more sizes,” she said. “For my Simone, it took probably five minutes to map out the increases after I had my first set of numbers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hk5SQD"&gt;Sarah Krentz, designer and owner of &lt;a href="https://www.swankyemuknits.com/"&gt;Swanky Emu Knits&lt;/a&gt;, produces patterns that forego the idea of sizes all together. Her spreadsheet sizing technique turns each pattern into an instant calculator for the customer. The interactive designs include a few blank spreadsheet cells, in which knitters fill in key measurements like bust, waist, and bicep circumference. The rest of the pattern — how many stitches to increase at the bodice, how many rows to knit before splitting the sleeves — updates automatically using pre-set formulas written by Krentz. No body is too small, too large, or too disproportionately shaped to fit the garments. Krentz also teaches classes for other designers who want to produce patterns using the same technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xB8jt"&gt;Krentz’s spreadsheet sizing doesn’t force knitters to explain why they deserve to wear her sweaters; a person’s measurements are just a set of numbers. In general, the decision to include larger sizes, she said, is seen as a charitable “extra” to throw in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2lKQQ"&gt;“That says something about the choice the designer made,” Krentz said. “Of not wanting someone like me, or not thinking someone like me should or will wear their garment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="N28e4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People have their way of making you not feel welcome”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f0vk9l"&gt;For the past several years, that question of the imagined audience — of what a knitter is &lt;em&gt;supposed &lt;/em&gt;to look like — has swirled and at times exploded in the knitting community. Capping a sweater design at a 46-inch bust (an XL, according to Craft Yarn Council standards) sets a visible and quantitative limit to who can wear that pattern. But the industry has a way of asserting other assumptions around &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/25/18234950/knitting-racism-instagram-stories"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, gender, class, and more, issues that are perhaps imperceptible to those who have always felt welcomed in knitting spaces. Knitters say limited size offerings go hand in hand with issues plaguing the craft, often presented as a hobby for white women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eH0YZg"&gt;“You definitely feel the -isms in the knitting community,” Hicks, who is Black, said. “People have their way of making you not feel welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6hsaN"&gt;Narrow size offerings also leave money on the table. Despite the twee, old-timey image prevalent in the general public’s imagination, knitting can be an expensive hobby. A skein of yarn from a big box craft store might only cost $5, but hand-dyed and indie-produced fiber popular in the crafting community could run upward of $30 a skein. A knitter like Hicks who might need 10 to 15 skeins for a sweater is looking at a $300 investment, not including the time it takes to knit the garment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MsQrcC"&gt;Excluding entire swaths of potential clientele based on size — not to mention people who might become discouraged from learning to knit — is bad for business. (This holds true in traditional retail, too; &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/12/18222409/retailers-women-in-between-plus-straight-size"&gt;two-thirds&lt;/a&gt; of American women wear size 14 or above.) But experienced knitters say the failure to include a wide array of bodies in the development of designs also makes the final product’s quality suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYWpHf"&gt;Before patterns are published for sale, designers often have test knitting periods, where knitters are hired to essentially beta test the design. They’re asked to comment on the clarity of the written pattern as well as flag any fit issues, like a neck being too tight or forearms coming out baggy relative to the rest of the garment. Because all bodies are different, it helps designers to have an array of people giving feedback. In the past, when pressed to explain why patterns didn’t come in larger sizes, some designers have claimed they didn’t know a plus-size knitter to test knit their garment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q02fqQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m fat and I knit, and I’m telling you I want to give you money”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a7vkh9"&gt;It’s an excuse Mere Conatti had heard too many times. Conatti says she started the Instagram page &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/fattestknits/"&gt;Fat Test Knits&lt;/a&gt; out of spite, after two designers told her they hadn’t created their pattern in her size because they couldn’t find a suitable test knitter. They didn’t have any future plans to include Conatti’s size, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uuzgdr"&gt;“It made me really frustrated,” Conatti said. “I’m thinking, ‘I’m fat and I knit, and I’m telling you I want to give you money.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RuAf1"&gt;Fat Test Knits serves as a bulletin board that connects designers looking to offer a wider range of sizes with test knitters eager to help them. Conatti, along with another moderator, vets and shares designs that are in development, and followers then contact designers to be included in the testing group. Since 2019, the account has shared over 500 patterns: textured drawstring pants, crocheted bikinis, knit harnesses, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zh5LFq"&gt;Though the shift is incremental, knitters say the industry is waking up. Some popular designers have updated old patterns to include extended sizes. Others have heeded calls from the public and committed to size-inclusive designs. Conatti says grassroots efforts and independent designers and publishers are largely to thank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sMN8DO"&gt;Hicks has christened 2021 as the year they will make their first sweater for themselves, and now feels like there are options. But inclusive size ranges, diverse tester pools and other shifts in knitting are hard-fought wins. Plus-size people are still often forced to ask to be accommodated, rather than be welcomed from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xhQpVJ"&gt;“It’s just something I have to do if I want something,” Hicks said. “No one’s going to fight for me as hard as I would fight for myself.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will warn users before posting ‘inappropriate or unkind’ comments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VffmhCSUmonmsVSDIoyG0LD2OY8=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940761/image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The pop-up gives users the option of editing their comment, or posting it anyway.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: TIkTok&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmfRGE"&gt;TikTok is rolling out a pop-up today that’s designed to warn users before they post a comment that might be “&lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-promote-kindness"&gt;inappropriate or unkind.&lt;/a&gt;” The new feature is one of two being announced that are designed to “promote kindness” on the service. The other is Filter All Comments, so that they only appear once individually approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fucAHp"&gt;The new unkind warning appears if TikTok believes a comment might violate its community guidelines. “Would you like to reconsider posting this?” the pop-up box reads, before encouraging users to “Edit” it, or “Post anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxzNWP"&gt;Prompts like these have been explored by other social networks to cut down on bullying and harassment. Instagram rolled out similar prompts &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagrams-commitment-to-lead-fight-against-online-bullying"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248201/twitter-reply-warning-harmful-language-revise-tweet-moderation"&gt;testing them last year&lt;/a&gt;, and they’ve also been &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/facebook/comments/k3bbfh/just_went_to_post_a_comment_on_facebook_this/"&gt;spotted on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. Instagram later reported that results from introducing the prompt had been “&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/our-progress-on-leading-the-fight-against-online-bullying"&gt;promising&lt;/a&gt;” and that it found “these types of nudges can encourage people to reconsider their words when given a chance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emulZOG5UvwH3x4cNqacEOpIGgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358891/image__2_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The toggle is available in the Comments filters menu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1GlLL1iwtJxKdeHTsTnUI_Jdufo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358892/image__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image; TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After enabling the feature, users must then manually approve comments on their videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yDpxR2"&gt;The new Filter All Comments feature can be enabled in the Comments filters menu, which already allows users to filter spam and offensive comments, or filter based on specific keywords. Once enabled, creators have to manually approve individual comments before they appear under their videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftcVNt"&gt;As part of today’s announcement, TikTok has also announced it’s partnering with the &lt;a href="https://cyberbullying.org/"&gt;Cyberbullying Research Center&lt;/a&gt; as it works on more anti-bullying initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EU aims to double chip manufacturing amid growing fears about ‘digital sovereignty’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Semiconductor Production at Globalfoundries Europe Plant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbvKxvpYp7b5vj9mGUpQWfjKsZQ=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940681/1231203170.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Semiconductor production, as shown above in GlobalFoundries’ European factory, is an extremely capital-intensive business.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Box6j2"&gt;The European Union wants to double its chip manufacturing output to 20 percent of the global market by 2030. The goal is part of its new &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_983"&gt;Digital Compass plan&lt;/a&gt;, announced yesterday, which aims to boost “digital sovereignty” by funding various high-tech initiatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfGJv0"&gt;As well as doubling chip output, the EU also wants all households to have 5G access and gigabit internet connectivity by 2030; for “all key public services” to be available online in every member state; and for the bloc to have its first quantum computer. Funding for these and other projects will come from the EU’s €672.5 billion ($800 billion) &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en"&gt;coronavirus response fund&lt;/a&gt;, with 20 percent of this money ($160 billion) earmarked for tech investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMCPs2"&gt;The EU’s ambition to produce more semiconductor chips is particularly notable. Maintaining a steady supply of these chips has become a pressing concern for nations around the world as supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic and the US-China trade war have affected global supplies. As with the flow of key resources like oil, access to cutting-edge chips is essential for many industries and products, from iPhones to cars. Currently, the bulk of production is concentrated in Asia, particularly in Taiwan and Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6r7FF"&gt;In February, President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to investigate how the US can further support its own chip manufacturing industry. “This is about making sure the United States can meet every challenge we face in this new era of pandemics, but also in defense cybersecurity, climate change, and so much more,” said Biden at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-BIDEN" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haYR4a0Ucpa2eb9Fki2NoqLES2M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358937/1231364830.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;US President Joe Biden pledged in February to secure the United States’ “critical” chip supply chains.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6hxqis"&gt;The EU’s worries mirror those of America’s. “We need to become less dependent on others when it comes to key technologies,” vice president of the European Commission, Margrethe Vestager, said at the launch of the Digital Compass plans, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-seeks-to-double-share-of-world-chip-market-by-2030-in-digital-sovereignty-drive-11615305395"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXgmt7"&gt;This dependency extends beyond chip supply, too. The last few years have seen the EU grapple with its relationship with Chinese tech giant Huawei, which supplies essential 5G components but has been hamstrung by US sanctions introduced over national security concerns. In related news, Apple announced this week that it will &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F03%2Fapple-to-invest-over-1-billion-euros-in-germany-with-new-munich-campus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F10%2F22322860%2Feu-semiconductor-chip-supply-double-output-2030-global-compass-investment" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;invest more than €1 billion &lt;/a&gt; ($1.2 billion) in a silicon design center in Germany. Its employees will focus on “5G and future wireless technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eZkOS"&gt;Building up the EU’s chip production, though, will be a difficult task. Manufacturing semiconductors is an extremely expensive business, and the main success of European companies has been creating machinery used in this process rather than the chips themselves. Dutch firm ASML, for example, has a &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2020/02/29/how-asml-became-chipmakings-biggest-monopoly"&gt;majority market share&lt;/a&gt; in the production of equipment known as “photolithographic machines” that are essential for chipmaking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPde6Z"&gt;“As China has shown, throwing money at chips does not guarantee success,” Dan Wang, a technology analyst at Gavekal Dragonomics, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ. &lt;/em&gt;“For the last few decades, Europe has seen its number of semiconductor companies shrink, and it will require a mighty effort to wrest leadership from the US and Asia, which are also investing heavily.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly overestimated iPhone 12 mini demand, by a lot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PX2wXenA5__HmquoXnkOMHZwero=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940493/vpavic_4279_20201107_0043.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GwFmuf"&gt;Apple is cutting production of the iPhone 12 mini in the first half of this year, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-slashes-planned-iPhone-12-mini-production-for-1H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Planned production of the smallest iPhone 12 model has reportedly been reduced by 70 percent or more in the first half of this year, making up the majority of a 20 percent cut in total iPhone 12 production. Some suppliers have been asked to temporarily stop producing iPhone 12 mini-specific components, while other parts are being reallocated to the Pro and Pro Max, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCFt4B"&gt;Alongside the iPhone production news, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; also reports that Apple has pushed back production for two new Apple Silicon MacBooks. Originally due to enter mass production in May or June, the laptops will now be manufactured in the second half of the year. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report doesn’t reveal which of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; these could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="93q6qX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iPhone production is still expected to be up overall compared to 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOTPMS"&gt;Despite the cuts, iPhone production is still scheduled to be up overall compared to 2020. Apple reportedly plans to produce 75 million handsets in the first half of the year, and 230 million phones over the course of 2021. Part of the reason is though to be because Apple was overly aggressive in booking up production capacity in the first place ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The shortage is now creating problems for companies both inside and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; of the technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uqyNCZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;’s report is the latest indication that Apple’s miniature addition to its flagship smartphone lineup hasn’t lived up to expectations. Last month&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUKKBN2A91N0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; on analyst data which claimed sales of the 12 mini had made up just five percent of Apple’s smartphone sales in the first half of January. &lt;em&gt;Nikkei &lt;/em&gt;reports that as of the end of last year, the mini made up 10 to 15 percent of Apple’s iPhone 12 series orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7HjEh"&gt;Although we liked the iPhone 12 mini &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;when we reviewed it&lt;/a&gt;, overall smartphone demand is trending towards phones with bigger screens. And while the 12 mini also benefits from being cheaper than the other handsets in the iPhone 12 lineup, customers have the option of &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/05/iphone-12-mini-sales-disappointed/#h-iphone-12-mini-sales:~:text=The%20CIRP%20report%20also%20touches%20on,be%20more%20enticing%20for%20certain%20buyers%3A"&gt;buying previous year’s models&lt;/a&gt; if they want to save money. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos partners with Audi to bring its audio tech to cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OxkMGoZbFdGiJLpdDP8mMXHXwMY=/757x378:2097x1271/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940449/A211114_overfull.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Sonos-branded speaker inside Audi’s new TV, the Q4 E-Tron.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Audi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JOuxWq"&gt;Sonos has partnered with Audi to equip the automaker’s Q4 E-Tron with sound, a first for the California-based audio company best known for home speakers. The news was confirmed Tuesday by Sonos CEO Patrick Spence after Audi published images of the Q4 E-Tron’s interior showing the Sonos logo. &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/sonos-audi-partnership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; was first to report&lt;/a&gt; the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYh0Qf"&gt;On Tuesday, Audi published a trove of shots showing off the interior of its next EV, the Q4 E-Tron. While the German carmaker emphasized its new augmented reality heads-up display, others took note of the Sonos logo, despite no mention of the collaboration in the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7WIM8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10383842"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FgAIc"&gt;“We want to be in all the different categories of audio, and a big chunk of that is in auto,” said Spence during the Q&amp;amp;A of a &lt;a href="https://investors.sonos.com/news-and-events/events-and-presentations/events/event-details/2021/Sonos-Investor-Event/"&gt;scheduled investor event&lt;/a&gt;. “Our first partnership of bringing our sound experience to automobiles is with Audi.” The Sonos CEO and former RIM executive said that more details of the Audi partnership will be shared “shortly,” presumably at the Q4 E-Tron launch event in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KK99w4"&gt;With the announcement, Sonos joins a long list of audio companies that have made the jump to autos, including Bose, Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins, and Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen. The partnerships are seen as a way for home audio companies to diversify revenue sources, and for automakers to use brands known for premium audio to sway your buying decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKrUey"&gt;The news follows the Tuesday launch of Sonos’ most portable speaker to date, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319251/sonos-roam-pricing-features-release-date"&gt;$169 Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;. Sonos is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286147/sonos-headphones-new-design-german-patent-office"&gt;rumored to be working on headphones&lt;/a&gt; as the company broadens its focus from whole-home audio to providing sound anywhere you want it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYe1se"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ new ROG Phone 5 Ultimate has 18GB of RAM and a rear-facing OLED screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xU7BKq-g8xVhFCvkMdSg7K2Fa6Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940445/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7O1TxR"&gt;Asus is going big with its latest gaming phones. The ROG Phone 5 lineup will start shipping this month across the globe, costing 799 euros (around $950) for the base configuration with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage. Every configuration has a 6.78-inch FHD+ OLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and a 300Hz touch sampling rate. Also, the headphone jack has made a comeback after being absent from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, this time with a quad DAC in tow for hi-res audio. (In case you’re wondering where the ROG Phone 4 went, Asus skipped over the number four, like OnePlus did, due to its similarities with the word “death” in some Asian languages.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hemsoR"&gt;The most notable changes from the last generation are exclusive to some even more expensive configurations, the ROG Phone 5 Pro and Ultimate (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;which I published a review of&lt;/a&gt;) that release in April for 1,199 euros (approximately $1,420) and in May for 1,299 euros (about $1,583), respectively. Both of these models have double the storage and more RAM (starting at 16GB in the Pro and going all the way up to 18GB in the Ultimate); come in limited edition colors; and have two additional ultrasonic touch sensors than the standard model, located near where your ring fingers might rest while holding the phone in landscape mode. You’ll also get a case and a clip-on AeroActive Cooler 5 fan attachment with purchase with either the Pro or Ultimate phone (which adds two more buttons attached to the fan.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IG0kJe"&gt;The new Asus gaming phones aren’t huge departures from their predecessors, though the hardware and software are more refined. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22085537"&gt;I reviewed the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivers on its promises to be a spec and feature juggernaut in some clever ways, paying $1,580 for it seems steep. Even the $950 base configuration isn’t what I’d consider affordable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMz3EQ"&gt;The Ultimate and Pro include “ROG Vision,” a feature that pushes premade or custom text or graphics to its rear-facing OLED screen. It’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, allowing you to personalize your phone if you want. The standard ROG Phone 5 simply has a backlit ROG logo, which some might find to be just enough pizazz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r0hESauBGwuXXO05RRb5bE2v-xY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354178/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00012.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pIhpxO"&gt;I go into all of the features in the review. But if you’re just passing by and want to know all about the specs, I’ve attached a handy table just for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate review: overkill</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s a mystifying phone with a steep price tag&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FWmeum"&gt;It’s reductive to refer to the Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate as &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;a phone, even if it is one. Sure, it runs Android 11, and it can take calls, snap pictures, and do all of the other stuff every other phone can do. But if its edgy looks and tiny monochromatic OLED screen mounted on its back didn’t already give it away, this phone is &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm7OXX"&gt;This is Asus’ latest attempt (technically its fourth, but it’s skipping that number in the name for superstitious reasons) at building a console-like experience into a phone for a niche but thriving global crowd of mobile gamers. It offers more power and customization than other large-screened phones, both in terms of hardware and software. It’s a real spec sandwich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5c0Dw"&gt;For example, it has multiple USB-C ports to let you charge it in either landscape or portrait mode. This model also includes a snap-on fan cooler (its sole job is to keep the phone from overheating when you overclock it), and the fan packs USB-C passthrough charging, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and two remappable trigger buttons. In addition to that, there are some ultrasonic sensors around the phone that can replace some touch controls to make games feel more like you’re using a controller. And for this year’s model, its Armoury Crate app can boost its processor and graphics speed, increase the screen’s refresh rate, and more on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BL7tXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10382537"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XsosXV"&gt;The Ultimate is Asus’ highest-end ROG Phone 5 coming in May for 1,299 euros (which is around $1,583). But other less expensive options will ship before then, starting in March for around $950. How does Asus justify the $600 price delta? This is the only configuration that has a matte white colorway with a few blue details sprinkled around the phone. And it’s the only one in the lineup — and perhaps the only phone other than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;RedMagic’s new 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; — that has 18GB of RAM. It’s an impressive spec to find in a phone, but I’m still searching for a use case that requires having this much RAM. The cheaper versions of the ROG Phone 5 ship with 16GB and 12GB of RAM, respectively, which I’m betting doesn’t make a huge difference in performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l1DHHm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10382540"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rG56aG"&gt;The Ultimate, in particular, seems to be made for only the most diehard of ROG fans. The phone comes with a laptop-sized box filled with a ROG-themed ball cap, towel, face covering, stickers, and more goodies. Aside from the aforementioned specs, the ever-so-slightly less expensive (but still around $1,420) ROG Phone 5 Pro, coming in April 2021, is very similar to the Ultimate. Both phones include two additional ultrasonic sensors on their backs near where your ring fingers might rest while holding them in landscape mode, as well as the rear-facing OLED screen I mentioned earlier called “ROG Vision.” It’s a thumb drive-sized display that’s a spin on Asus’ “Anime Matrix” effect used in the Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop, possibly attracting even more eyeballs at this bizarre-looking phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f8BuFXAogjiciePCr5tO1d9IoN8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357615/mask_up.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t really think of what else to do with ROG Vision, so I made a PSA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdxl0z"&gt;Asus provides preloaded messages and graphics to use for the display that are situational depending on whether you’re gaming, charging the phone, or getting a call on your phone, to name a few, but you can crop your own images to fit within the display, as I did. Anything from a scrolling message with emoji to an image will work, and you can customize it further with an animation, like a static fade or fireworks. It’s like a souped-up version of the LEDs that companies put on the outside of flip phones, or even on Samsung’s Z Flip. The standard ROG Phone 5 has an RGB-backlit ROG logo instead. Some might actually prefer that to having the extra screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUs82o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10382527"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i9KsE5"&gt;The ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a better gaming phone than its predecessors, as well as the competing devices I’ve tried so far from Xiaomi’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/15/18678066/black-shark-2-xiaomi-gaming-phone-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;Black Shark&lt;/a&gt;. For one, it’s the most powerful option out there with the Snapdragon 888 processor and its 18GB of RAM. Every device in the lineup starts with 512GB of fast UFS 3.1 storage, so it flies with opening apps, switching between them, and for other tasks that access storage. Its 6.78-inch FHD+ (2448 x 1080) OLED screen is one of the best I’ve ever used, even if it’s far too large to be my ideal size. Asus kept the 144Hz refresh rate (which automatically adjusts per app for efficiency by default) from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21332716/asus-rog-phone-3-gaming-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-airtriggers-oled-ram"&gt;ROG Phone 3&lt;/a&gt;, but its touch latency is down to 24 milliseconds here with a 300Hz touch sampling rate, meaning it checks 300 times per second to see where you’ve touched it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21063061/oneplus-8-120-hz-high-refresh-rate-screen-pete-lau"&gt;The OnePlus 8 Pro has a 240Hz sampling rate&lt;/a&gt;, for context. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314911/redmagic-6-tencent-edition-specs-price-launch-date-announced"&gt;The new RedMagic 6&lt;/a&gt; that’s expected to be far more affordable than the base ROG Phone 5 configuration uses similar display tech, but with a faster 165Hz refresh rate and a faster 500Hz touch sampling rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veyvt9"&gt;The specs and display used in each ROG Phone 5 make playing games look sharp and run smoothly, and some other features elevate the experience further, whether you’re gaming or watching movies. I particularly love the dual front-facing speakers. They offer the best stereo separation I’ve heard from a phone — to the point where, in most situations, I’m just as pleased to listen to audio aloud at home as I am through headphones. Speaking of, this year’s device sees the return of a 3.5mm audio jack that was missing from the 2020 ROG Phone 3. Asus brought it back with a vengeance, too, equipped with an ESS ES9280AC Pro quad DAC for hi-res audio. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/joa1UySTEX9Ia-WFeaS_O8GGpDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357064/gamegenie.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Game Genie overlay offers instant access to system info and settings with a swipe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2TSpkT"&gt;Asus has spent the year refining its Armoury Crate game launcher-meets-dedicated console UI. Its looks haven’t changed dramatically since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896952/asus-rog-phone-ii-review-android-gaming-phone-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Phone II&lt;/a&gt;, but in case you’re hearing about this for the first time, it’s filled with so many useful features for gamers. It lets you make a “scenario profile’’ for each game, where you can tweak settings to get more out of each game and, in turn, squeeze more performance from the ROG Phone 5. A profile consists of things like what refresh rate you want the screen to run at, and how much you want to amp up the power of the processor, graphics chip, and RAM. It even lets you turn off network switching, as well as background data and app syncing on a per-game basis. If you’re familiar with gaming on PC, the closest parallel is Nvidia’s GeForce Experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD1CH1"&gt;A big part of this software — and one of the more compelling features of the phone itself — is configuring AirTriggers. These ultrasonic sensors embedded within the phone can be mapped to emulate buttons so you don’t need to use the touch screen as often. All of the ROG Phone 5 models have sensors along the right edge, so they feel like triggers when you’re holding them in landscape mode. The Ultimate and Pro models add two additional touch sensors near where my ring fingers rest on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZLYieS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10382549"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C9a4qX"&gt;As a way to avoid using clumsy touch controls, AirTriggers are still as handy and clever as ever. Being able to map the jump and attack commands in games like &lt;em&gt;Genshin Impact&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; actually makes those mobile ports fun to play for me. What’s great is that games don’t need to support controllers for the feature to work. While a game is running, you can move an AirTrigger cursor onto whichever command you’d like to create a “button” for on the phone. In the settings, you can choose whether you want to tap or swipe to issue the command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb21X"&gt;I’ve barely scratched the surface in terms of the settings you can tweak. In addition to AirTriggers, you can map motion controls to execute commands. And by clamping the included AeroActive Cooler 5 fan onto the phone, it affords two extra trigger buttons that can be mapped to your liking, plus a kickstand. There’s just &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; customization.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/702SiKs875OMZ6GWr4U0CZDa5Us=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357713/aeroactivecooler.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AeroActive Cooler 5 snapped on. I have my middle fingers resting on the mappable triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZpaJR"&gt;Outside of gaming on a PC, I’m in the “controller or bust” camp, and thus, I don’t usually want to suffer through touch controls to play the latest Android games. AirTriggers makes the experience better, no doubt, but it’s still not enough to convert me. Thankfully, for people like me, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate (and the other new models) supports some modern controllers, like Microsoft’s Xbox One controller, Sony’s DualShock 4, or Google’s Stadia controller. Impressively, the software lets you remap the controls for any mobile game onto those controllers. It detected my Xbox controller immediately when I connected it with an OTG adapter, and mapping the buttons was simpler than I expected. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bauGjkOzCSny8HLoDmof6GV1c-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357258/genshinmapping.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s easy to map on-screen controls to a controller through the Game Genie function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lmyjhj"&gt;As for the actual phone stuff, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is a high-end phone through and through. It has responsive haptic feedback at every turn, whether you’re getting text messages, tapping your way through Asus’ ROG UI interface (its game-themed twist on Zen UI, which is refined as ever), or using the AirTriggers in a game. Asus told me that it tuned its haptics in-house, and compared to some other Android phones I’ve used, it doesn’t buzz loudly or rattle the phone. It’s what I hope more phone haptics feel like once &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297285/qualcomm-lofelt-haptics-vibration-snapdragon-888-api-software"&gt;Qualcomm and Lofelt roll out their haptics framework for other devices running the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;. But as Asus proved with this phone, a company can make good haptics if it wants to. This device has a 6,000mAh battery inside that’s split into two 3,000mAh cells, which Asus says helps with lower charge and discharge temperatures. Additionally, it allows the phone to recharge at 65W speeds, but it lacks wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The selfie cam is fine, but there’s some lens flare above Becca’s head, and the details are a little soft. Some people may like that, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ri3Fy1J78DFStaUnhPxWOh7lfVQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22357250/rogphone5ultimateportrait.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portrait mode is totally serviceable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xu9pgX"&gt;Asus has committed to launching the ROG Phone 5 lineup globally, but it hasn’t shared a specific launch date in the US or official pricing, which is why I’ve been going off a euro conversion. However, the company told me that all of these phones will work on T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T, and to that end, they support these carriers’ sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="PB9gZC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10382481"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="evccUQ"&gt;It’s amazing to see what a manufacturer can do when it isn’t worried about making the thinnest design with the best cameras, or stuck on meeting an ultra-competitive price point as the likes of Samsung, Apple, and Google are. Asus wasn’t afraid to get weird here, and that weirdness comes through in several ways that make it a good fit for gamers chasing after the most powerful phone in existence at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vK1VPu"&gt;Though, the value here falls apart completely if you think about it too much. For the $1,580 that this phone costs, you could build a very good PC or get a PS5, Xbox Series X, and Nintendo Switch together with change left over. Outside of paying for a phone data plan, this would add about $65 to that if you finance it with monthly payments over a two-year period. While this phone definitely has a leg up on the competition when it comes to power and software features, it’s not worth paying this much to get them. And if you just want to stream games via the cloud with Microsoft’s xCloud service or with Google Stadia, you only need to spend a fraction of this cost to get a phone that can do game streaming well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdgHOlLWcRVY9Rb32zyALR7BehM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22354177/cfaulkner_210228_4452_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stock wallpapers are actually great this time around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qYdOzO"&gt;Like every gaming phone I’ve checked out yet, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate is stuck in this weird place of being a very capable device that somehow delivers on its many promises, yet it still doesn’t feel worth the money. For average people who play the occasional game, either directly from their phones or through game streaming services, buying a cheap clip to fasten a controller to your phone will probably be a good enough solution. There are also some comfortable controller setups for iPhone and Android (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbones-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review"&gt;Backbone’s Go&lt;/a&gt; and Razer’s Kishi for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431952/razer-kishi-controller-iphone-ios-review"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt;) that can turn most phones into more of a Nintendo Switch-like experience that requires less fuss and far less of an investment than Asus’ ROG Phone 5 Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will relaunch its Lite app in 170 countries with support for Reels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HfFVYpywtSEOd1M73gemotupwhk=/1x0:3241x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940373/Instagram_Lite__3_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qI89VL"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17512874/instagram-lite-app-developing-world-low-data-usage"&gt;launched its smaller Lite app&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 only to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/11/instagram-lite-shuts-down-in-advance-of-a-relaunch/"&gt;pull it from the Play Store&lt;/a&gt; in spring of last year. Now, the app’s getting a relaunch with new features and a slightly larger file size. Instagram announced today that the app will start rolling out on Android to 170 countries, including the US, through the Play Store, and that the new app requires only two megabytes, compared to the regular Instagram app’s 30MB. (The original Lite app only required 573 kilobytes, however, so it’s definitely larger than that.) No iOS version is planned for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLBZZS"&gt;This bigger size allows for new features, though, including the ability to send direct messages and record and post videos. It also prominently features the Reels tab on the homepage while forgoing the shopping tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rznfHc"&gt;In a briefing, Instagram Lite product manager Nick Brown said the team has “no plans” to bring shopping to Instagram Lite, but that Reels had “a lot of engagement” in India, which is why the team decided to keep that tab in this iteration of the Lite app. (TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;is banned in India&lt;/a&gt; currently and has reduced its team there, so Reels has had a chance to blossom without the competition.) Users won’t be able to make their own Reels from the app, however. They also can’t use augmented reality face filters, although the team is “absolutely” exploring it. Other, less data-intensive creation tools, like stickers, GIFs, and text can still be applied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBeMWz"&gt;For now, the app doesn’t have ads, although Brown tells&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the team is “committed to offering the full suite of monetization tools.” He and the team want to “take the space and time — that everything we launched in Lite we can fully support and that it is just as good of an experience as it is in the regular Instagram.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zA2agi"&gt;Many companies have launched smaller, pared-down versions of their apps for users around the world who might share phones or use older devices with less storage. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/4/8730883/facebook-lite-slow-network-developing-world-android"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its Lite app in 2015 while TikTok &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/04/tiktoks-quietly-launched-lite-app-has-reached-over-12-million-downloads-since-august/"&gt;launched its version&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. For companies that need to be global in order to grow, a smaller app is one way to bring new users on board. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s long-awaited new webcam reportedly arriving at Surface spring event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T3EuMdZg2cAuVfD6ucBQwboNjBk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940361/vpavic_190404_3378_0068.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USB-C webcam on Microsoft’s Surface Hub 2.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sCdoLo"&gt;Microsoft is reportedly planning to release a new webcam this spring. The software giant has previously offered a variety of webcams under its LifeCam brand, but Microsoft hasn’t updated these significantly for 10 years. &lt;a href="https://petri.com/microsoft-to-unveil-new-webcam-this-spring"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Petri &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that a Surface event will take place this spring, and a new webcam will be on the agenda alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319854/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-specs-features-release-price-leak"&gt;Microsoft’s new Surface Laptop 4&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1Mpyv"&gt;The webcam will reportedly include a privacy cover and support high dynamic range (HDR). While Microsoft uses 4K USB-C webcams on its Surface Hub 2 device, this new webcam is rumored to skip 4K support. It’s not clear what resolution will be supported, or whether it will support Windows Hello facial recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9ol4ccAVRpp6JBsiiG9deAnmEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22358907/1313577f_2a54_4414_8bce_a2e8deb8ebc0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s old LifeCam webcams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FkDhy7"&gt;Whether Microsoft choses to use the Surface branding on this new webcam also remains to be seen. Microsoft’s Windows and devices chief, Panos Panay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931724/microsoft-surface-studio-modular-usb-c-webcam-panos-panay-interview-2018"&gt;hinted all the way back in 2018 in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company was looking at releasing Surface-branded webcams. “Look at the camera on Surface Hub 2, note it’s a USB-C-based camera, and the idea that we can bring a high fidelity camera to an experience, you can probably guess that’s going to happen,” hinted Panay at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxQfK3"&gt;This isn’t the first time a new Microsoft webcam has been rumored. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/22/18152996/microsoft-windows-xbox-webcam-windows-hello-features-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thurrott &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that two new webcams would arrive in 2019, one for Windows and one for Xbox. Those webcams never launched, and consumers and businesses have been relying on webcams from Logitech, Razer, and others instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgIt1z"&gt;Webcams quickly became &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22173744/webcam-gadget-of-the-year-2020"&gt;the gadget of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, as consumers flocked to buy the devices to work from home during the pandemic. Prices of webcams also shot up briefly early on in the pandemic, before supply caught up and demand settled towards the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s secret home robot Vesta reportedly in ‘late-prototype stage’ of development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yP-GzawSE8xB5RpNiMlpolysTv8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68940282/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ER5gJ3"&gt;Amazon appears to have reached the “late-prototype stage” in the creation of its secretive home robot codenamed Vesta, claims a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazons-lab126-vesta-project-grows-but-insiders-are-concerned-2021-3?op=1&amp;amp;scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4&amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device has been under development for around four years and now has more than 800 employees working on it, says the publication. If the robot launches, it will be one of Amazon’s biggest and most ambitious new products, in the mold of the Echo, Kindle, and Fire Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OpWhX"&gt;Indeed, it’s comparisons to the latter device, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9292695/amazon-fire-phone-sales-end"&gt;failed smartphone project&lt;/a&gt;, that seems to be concerning some of those involved in Vesta’s development. “People are very skeptical — we’re worried it could turn into another Fire Phone,” one of six anonymous sources cited by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; as “directly involved in the project” told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQGY0Pj6kVKelOmcDxD3YJTv-O8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324194/dseifert_210219_4433_0012sq.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vesta is reported to have a built-in screen like some of Amazon’s recent Alexa devices. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ge2ujl"&gt;As with any unannounced device of this scale, there is an abundance of unanswered questions and uncertain details. The basic premise, though, is that Vesta will be an Amazon Echo on wheels: a voice-activated assistant that can navigate your home, respond to your commands, and interface with other smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ7d9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report contains a number of intriguing and speculative details, including the suggestion that the device is the size of “two small cats” — about 10 to 13 inches wide (your conversion may vary depending on your cats). The robot will reportedly be equipped with a screen, microphone, and several cameras. Additional features could include sensors for monitoring temperature, humidity, and air quality; a “small compartment” for carrying objects; and a “waist-high retractable pole with a camera” which could be combined with machine vision tech to help users find items around their house like keys and wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_7f5sFnL4zzu944aChX1Jv84z8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21906023/20200921_image_blog_flyingcamera_sidebyside_2910x1637_fcc_rgb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon owned-Ring announced a home surveillance drone last year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9EuOCh"&gt;Vesta, which is named after the Roman goddess of the hearth, shows Amazon’s ongoing drive to embed its products in the heart of customers’ homes. Over the years, the company has launched a number of devices attempting to extend its reach into kitchens and bedrooms, from the discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/6/20/15840814/amazon-dash-wand-alexa-review"&gt;Dash Wand&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed users to order grocery products by scanning barcodes, to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt;, a mini-drone announced last year by Amazon-owned Ring that provides mobile surveillance around the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gISqC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says Amazon has been developing Vesta as a “top priority,” but that early sales projections are modest. “Amazon could initially launch it as a limited invite-only product, similar to what it did with its fitness band Halo, according to these people,” says the publication. This could prevent the company from squandering resources on unsold-inventory. Even mobile robots won’t get up and sell themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx2rt3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
