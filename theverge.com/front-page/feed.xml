    <title>OnlyFans says never mind, it actually won’t ban porn on October 1st</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="id__kfx84vcphj"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499277302816773"&gt;abrupt tweet&lt;/a&gt;, video and image sharing site OnlyFans announced a reversal of the shocker announcement that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632797/onlyfans-prohibit-sexually-explicit-content-porn-creators"&gt;ban sexually explicit content&lt;/a&gt;. According to the company, “We have secured assurances necessary to support our diverse creator community and have suspended the planned October 1 policy change. OnlyFans stands for inclusion and we will continue to provide a home for all creators.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBxSXO"&gt;This comes just one day after its CEO said, in an interview with the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks"&gt;the reason for the ban was actually issues with its banking partners&lt;/a&gt;, not Mastercard as some had assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Llvs2X"&gt;Now OnlyFans creators, many of whom had already begun deleting content that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;violated the policy&lt;/a&gt; or started shifting their subscriber base to new platforms, are faced with a choice. They can either stick with a partner that grew to bring in billions by hosting content made by sex workers, or ditch the partner that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa"&gt;looked like it sold them out when things got tough&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vmLJDb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;An official communication to creators will be emailed shortly.&lt;/p&gt;— OnlyFans (@OnlyFans) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnlyFans/status/1430499278829592578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is launching on December 8th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHW7uueNptPUheLIDUqp9Sep3fE=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69773043/halo_infinites_grappleshot_opens_up_the_game_in_a_major_way.original.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozR7ki"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, the next game in Microsoft’s long-running franchise, will launch on December 8th. The date &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ALumia_Italia/status/1430417735704629254"&gt;appeared on the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; today and will likely be officially confirmed later today during the opening of Gamescom. A source familiar with Microsoft’s plans tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that December 8th is accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdLcGG"&gt;Microsoft had originally planned to launch &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; alongside the Xbox Series X / S in November 2020 but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;delayed the game&lt;/a&gt; to fall 2021 due in part to the challenges of game development during a pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeW9NB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s development has clearly been bumpy, and Microsoft even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403687/halo-infinite-bungie-joe-staten-returns-campaign"&gt;assigned Bungie veteran Joseph Staten&lt;/a&gt; to head up development of the game nearly a year ago. While we haven’t seen a great deal of campaign gameplay since the infamous Craig meme was born last year, the first multiplayer technical preview looked and felt just like the &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;that fans will enjoy playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPgmkP"&gt;The official launch date comes just days after 343 Industries revealed &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634448/halo-infinite-co-op-campaign-forge-delay-launch"&gt;won’t launch with campaign co-op and Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Cooperative play with friends should arrive in season two of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, approximately three months after launch. The Forge mode, that allows &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; players to customize and share maps, won’t arrive until season two of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, around six months after launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvy6Xy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;’s campaign co-op and Forge mode are popular parts of the franchise, so the news understandably disappointed fans. But the main &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; campaign and multiplayer mode is launching on December 8th, so fans will get a taste of new &lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;in less than four months.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Options Bae, Put Gang, and the new stock communities showing amateur traders how to make bank</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fR4oxBdEHpJjooIDhXFX4MGMS8E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772867/VRG_ILLO_4687_Clubhouse_Advice.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But the risk of trading means anyone can lose money trying&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GhUq4O"&gt;In the spring of 2020, Alaina Bradley was working in the collections department at a storage facility in eastern Tennessee. She was already pretty miserable before, but it got worse when the pandemic hit and she was overseeing mass auctions of people’s treasured belongings on the daily. With not much to lose, she decided to take a chance on something wild — and maybe too good to be true — that she’d been following on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87NZte"&gt;One of her mutuals from when she lived in Atlanta a few years back had been sharing screenshots of his gains on Robinhood nonstop, plus links to his stock trading course and pay-to-join investing community. “At first I thought, ‘Oh, he’s scamming people,’” Bradley says. But by the time that first stimulus check came in, Bradley, 30, was willing to give it a shot. She paid $99.99 for the class and access to the community from Steven Barge, an entrepreneur and owner of Barge Consulting Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gfu5LW"&gt;On her first trade a few weeks later, she turned $27 into $230. She was floored. Flush with beginner’s luck, she then dumped her entire stimulus check into her Robinhood account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="75udAX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s high risk”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMLNbZ"&gt;A year later, Bradley says she makes her living as a day trader, and she’s started selling her own investing courses, community, and coaching services under the moniker &lt;a href="https://www.optionsbae.com/"&gt;Options Bae&lt;/a&gt;. She’s one of many of-the-moment financial influencers taking their own experiences in the amateur investor boom of late — driven by the ease of commission-free trading and the rise of meme stocks — and making money showing others how to get in on the action. It’s an exciting prospect for would-be investors, but it’s also a gamble, opening up many more people to the types of riskier financial moves usually reserved for the professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXcbUS"&gt;“It’s high risk,” says Danielle “London” Elliott, a founding member of another trading group called &lt;a href="https://www.putgang.com/"&gt;Put Gang&lt;/a&gt;. Her group specializes in options, which are contracts that allow buyers to either purchase a certain stock at a predetermined price in the future (“call” options) or sell at a predetermined future price (“put” options). “But you can make a lot of money because you’re reserving multiple shares. It’s where the volatility is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="xGSz45"&gt;&lt;q&gt;They’re trying to increase financial literacy, especially for people shut out of wealth-building&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wEfADQ"&gt;Groups like Options Bae and Put Gang offer a way in for newbies interested in learning the stock market. You can find them on Instagram or Facebook posting their daily results, and sharing free tips and tricks in weekly meetings on Clubhouse open to all. While there are plenty of ways to learn the tools of the trade online via Google and YouTube, those who want more help are encouraged to pay for online courses and join the community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d98I2s"&gt;For $50 a month, Put Gang members get access to a digital course on options trading as well as access to a read-only version of their private Discord channel. For $150 a month, customers get everything included in the lower tier and the ability to participate in the conversation on Discord and ask questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmpD7D"&gt;Or would-be traders can check out a community like &lt;a href="https://stockstreetuniversity.com/our-community/"&gt;Stock Street University&lt;/a&gt;, which offers broader education on long-term investing and day trading. For $99.99, you get access to live virtual classes on investing strategies and 30-day access to the community. After that, you can pay $29.99 a month to continue to participate in the community chat and get daily email updates, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5BKJ7"&gt;Today, Stock Street University, which was launched officially in February, has 200 paying members in its Discord. While founders Q Sylvester, Marley Star, and JWise Pierre would love to grow Stock Street University’s membership and drive more revenue, the founders say their ultimate goal is more altruistic. They’re trying to increase financial literacy, especially for Black people and working people who have been shut out of wealth-building. “The typical white millennial family has $88,000 in wealth. The typical Black millennial family has about $5,000 in wealth,” Pierre says. “If you look at the data, only 1 percent of venture capital goes to Black founders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VmZFPu"&gt;“The goal is to show people there’s another path,” Star says, putting it simply: Why grind so hard when you can make your money work for you? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A website reading “Secure the Bag, Sis. Helping women create generational wealth through options trading.” The page shows several course options including “Bae Bundle,” “Stock and Options for Beginners,” and “Ultimate Strategy Guide,” with prices reaching up to $135." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7j8uW8WOROK2GYj0U1k7IvuvQJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773439/optionsbaewebsite.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the Options Bae website, which offers a number of beginners’ stock trading classes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SM8bB7"&gt;In the era of meme stocks and Dogecoin millionaires, the proliferation of stock trading communities is right on trend. 2021 has been a banner year for small, independent investors. While WallStreetBets’ GameStop frenzy is the most visible example, Credit Suisse estimates that trading activity of independent investors has &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/13/why-retail-investors-are-here-to-stay.html"&gt;doubled since the start of 2020&lt;/a&gt;, from 15-18 percent to over 30 percent by early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="neSW6S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I tell people, look, in this game there are wins and there are losses”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YgpfHU"&gt;These DIY trading influencers are not unlike so many creator-entrepreneurs who came before them. They’re simply building an audience from an authentic connection and marketing their wares accordingly. But selling the promise of generational wealth is arguably way more dicey than selling, say, handcrafted pottery or photography presets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHjDy0"&gt;This is one reason the Stock Street University and Options Bae websites are very careful to carry risk disclaimers. The founders of Stock Street don’t see themselves as financial advisers. “We don’t give financial advice,” Sylvester says. “All we can say is, this is something you can look into. This is what the market has done for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGl3Xe"&gt;“It’s a lot of responsibility, but I’m honest,” Put Gang’s creator, Michael, who goes by “The App God” online, says. “I tell people, look, in this game there are wins and there are losses. Our goal is to make our wins bigger than our losses.” His co-founder Elliott tells people, “Start with an amount of money you’re willing to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aXLpOh"&gt;In Put Gang’s Discord, a CNBC stream is broadcasting every day for those who don’t have cable. There’s a constantly updating live chat, resources like an investing slang glossary and videos on the Fibonacci tools, a semi-controversial mathematical technique for making trading decisions. “What I like about our group is we’re not just a bot telling you what to buy,” Elliott says. “There are so many stock Discords now, but with a lot of them you’re not learning the principles and the strategies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WDKGre"&gt;The way these groups work together sounds a lot like what a day for pro Wall Street traders is like, says Eric Liu, co-founder of investment analysis firm Vanda Research. “The social groups are entirely new for the retail investor,” Liu says. Nowadays, the behavior of amateur traders is often a driving factor in how the market moves — and that’s in no small part thanks to the networked community aspect of being an independent trader today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HEIC7"&gt;Liu points to the dot-com boom, the last time there was a similar influx of everyday traders trying to get in on the action. Back then, the information sources were &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; magazine, the nightly news, and the Yahoo message boards. Today, powerful social media platforms allow for a constant, real-time flow of information, as well as access to a hive mind of people who are working together to make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGGBL8"&gt;This has pros and cons. On the one hand, it’s exciting and brings more momentum to the market so that trends can happen faster, Liu says. For the individual trader, this means there are more opportunities to get involved, whether that’s because it’s easier to find your own way to it from the app store, or because you keep seeing a mutual posting screenshots of his gains on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzNBXC"&gt;The con is that there’s no such thing as a guarantee on the stock market — and mistakes can be costly. “I’ve lost a lot of money in a matter of minutes,” Elliott says. She declines to say exactly how much, saying only that it was enough that “if you told me I’d lose that much money in 9 minutes a year ago, I would have had a heart attack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Z9cCcj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The more access, the more education, the better”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3VRie"&gt;There’s also the fact that the current boom is not guaranteed to last. Historically speaking, booms are pretty much always followed by busts. Could a huge correction in the market be on its way? Absolutely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFGNMS"&gt;It’s a tricky line to walk, but even Liu says that many are underestimating the staying power — and the prowess — of individual investors. “The naysayers will compare the retail phenomenon to gambling. But it’s not. There is a risk. But it’s not a coin flip,” Liu says. He believes “the more access, the more education, the better.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGy4vY"&gt;For many of the people who’ve discovered the market over the past year, they see no turning back in their future. “This literally changed my life,” Elliott says. “It changed how I view success, how I view my time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EXrT1J"&gt;“I can never sleep in now,” Michael adds. “I will never miss a market open for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds Smart Reply to Docs comments to fill your life with more bland platitudes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B6F79s"&gt;Google is expanding the scope of its AI-powered Smart Reply feature &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/save-time-replying-to-comments-in.html"&gt;to suggest responses to comments in Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;. It will be rolling out in the coming weeks to all users and will be turned on by default, though you can disable it via &lt;em&gt;Tools &amp;gt; Preferences &amp;gt; Show Smart Reply suggestions&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zx0Cj"&gt;It’s the latest territory claimed by Google’s AI Smart Reply and Smart Compose features. The latter is already available in Gdocs and elsewhere, while the former lurks most prominently in your Gmail inbox. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a2K7QLN_qH5F8yHNYURj2Bz3x1c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804369/smart_reply_in_google_docs.png"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Smart Reply as it appears in comments in Google Docs&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zzuL2e"&gt;Reactions to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688106/gmail-smart-reply-whyd-you-push-that-button"&gt;these AI-powered features are varied&lt;/a&gt;. Some enjoy the convenience of using AI to offer up those little verbal platitudes that keep the wheels of workplace life turning smoothly (“That’s perfect, thank you!”). Others bemoan the deadening effect they have on language and, if you’re feeling particularly hyperbolic, on the human soul. Why think about what you’re saying to your colleagues if AI can fill in the gaps where you brain used to be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gr8mO"&gt;I for one, am simply looking forward to a time when I’m no longer needed to do my job, and my AI self can chat to my AI workmates, and I can go have a lie down somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nirvana baby sues band alleging child pornography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Opening Of ‘In Bloom The Nirvana Nevermind Exhibition’" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vCXtnRFYL10BEr2ROjfSymBfTwU=/0x34:3380x2287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772662/124872495.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spencer Elden, now 30, is suing over the iconic Nevermind album art.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Samir Hussein/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4bo1e7"&gt;The iconic nude baby photographed for the cover of Nirvana’s &lt;em&gt;Nevermind&lt;/em&gt; album is all grown up and suing the band, alleging the image violates child pornography laws. Spencer Elden, now 30, is seeking $150,000 from each of 17 named defendants, including record executives, Nirvana band members, and Courtney Love, the former wife and executor of Kurt Cobain’s estate, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/music/news/nirvana-baby-nevermind-lawsuit-1235048465/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOeCM2"&gt;The lawsuit, a copy of which was obtained by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, claims that the defendants knowingly exploited young Elden to increase attention and boost sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KosPEi"&gt;“Defendants intentionally commercially marketed Spencer’s child pornography and leveraged the shocking nature of his image to promote themselves and their music at his expense,” reads the lawsuit. “Defendants used child pornography depicting Spencer as an essential element of a record promotion scheme commonly utilized in the music industry to get attention, wherein album covers posed children in a sexually provocative manner to gain notoriety, drive sales, and garner media attention, and critical reviews.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyUeTD"&gt;As a result, the lawsuit contends that Elden “has suffered and will continue to suffer lifelong damages.”&lt;/p&gt;

Not only does he have a “Nevermind” tattoo emblazoned across his chest, he’s also recreated the pose on several occasions (always wearing a swimsuit) to mark the album’s major anniversaries.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung says it can remotely disable stolen TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6z_SUfTYXcWhtLO-_YZSddE9uC0=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772610/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung says the feature is “already pre-loaded on all Samsung TV products.”&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omY2JF"&gt;Samsung has revealed its TVs &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/za/samsung-supports-retailers-affected-by-looting-with-innovative-television-block-function"&gt;can be remotely disabled&lt;/a&gt; if the company finds out the units have been stolen. The feature is called the “&lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/za/support/newsalert/123186/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Television Block Function&lt;/a&gt;” and Samsung says it was recently activated in South Africa after a number of Samsung TVs were taken from a company warehouse during a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57818215"&gt;wave of protests and unrest&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3t1yYw"&gt;Samsung says the technology is “already pre-loaded on all Samsung TV products” and “ensures that the television sets can only be used by the rightful owners with a valid proof of purchase.” It’s not clear, though, from Samsung’s description whether the feature is only intended to combat large-scale theft, or if it will ever be used to help individual consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jz8x2N"&gt;For the TV Block Function to work, Samsung needs to know serial code of the stolen unit. When the set connects to the internet, it checks its serial code against a list on Samsung’s servers, and disables all TV functionality if it finds a match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jjqUfv1jxAGiNZZ1fa2uUfZWdWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804354/za_newsImg_485541334.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The TV Block feature logo&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fFVVLX"&gt;Blocking the TVs stolen in South Africa was presumably relatively easy. They’d been taken from Samsung’s own warehouse, where the company would be tracking its inventory. It’s possible that an average customer whose TV is stolen would be able to report its serial code to the company to have it remotely disabled, but it’s not clear if Samsung offers or plans to offer such a service. (We’ve reached out to the company to ask and will update this story if we hear back.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlQhVM"&gt;The company does say, though, that in the event that customers in South Africa have one of their TVs blocked by accident, they can have the block lifted by sending a proof of purchase to zaservicemanager@samsung.com.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Premium subscribers can now turn on picture-in-picture on iPhone — here’s how</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unpHc4LCFhB85ZFP2--7UePeWxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69772479/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VRhHTx"&gt;In June, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22540482/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone-ipad-ios-app-free-premium"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be bringing picture-in-picture to iOS. Now, it seems the much-demanded feature is finally available, though perhaps for a limited time only and only for YouTube Premium subscribers currently. Here’s how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UifLlx"&gt;If you’re a YouTube Premium subscriber, open up a web browser and head to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/new"&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll down to where “Picture-in-picture on iOS” is listed and click “Try it out.” You’ll be prompted to sign in to your account. Then, while watching a YouTube video, just navigate away from the app using the home button or by swiping up and picture-in-picture will start. Locking your phone screen while watching PiP will pause the video, but you can resume it via the lock screen media controls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LIjZtyU48d6dZYFmAXgu6GpOa10=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22804321/IMG_FAC59AB82AD0_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Head to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="http://www.youtube.com/new" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;www.youtube.com/new&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to enable the experimental feature&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cxDx7V"&gt;We spotted the news &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which notes that some users have been able to get the feature working on iPads as well as iPhones, but it seems access is a little unpredictable. (Apparently deleting the app might help.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5YpjS"&gt;YouTube says the feature is “Available until 31 Oct,” and we’re not sure what happens after this date. Fingers’ crossed that will be when YouTube — as promised in June — will be bringing the feature to all users, not just paid ones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California accuses Activision Blizzard of ‘withholding and suppressing evidence’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VGRDXoCuRG6EK6i6ifS7p4GOqnM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771875/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y2hQOy"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s leaders have promised to work to make the company a safe place for women to work — but California has now accused the company of illegally “withholding and suppressing evidence” and shredding documents that it requested for its investigation (&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-temporary-workers-4a8fa284-a003-4c56-819c-43c7c2d3f3ca.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;originally filed the suit in July&lt;/a&gt;, which accused the company of creating a frat-like culture where female employees faced “constant sexual harassment” and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk1xpJ"&gt;The updated complaint can be read below, and you can read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the original version here&lt;/a&gt;. Since the new version contains the same extremely disturbing details, it warrants the same &lt;strong&gt;content warning&lt;/strong&gt; as the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SCW4TK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The amended complaint says that Activision Blizzard cited attorney-client privilege when asked for evidence&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbEK6Y"&gt;In a new section of the complaint, the DFEH says Activision Blizzard is encouraging employees to talk to attorneys at the WilmerHale law firm instead of state investigators — and then denying the state access to that evidence because the conversations were confidential. Activision Blizzard had already been criticized by both a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;company shareholder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;the press&lt;/a&gt; for hiring WilmerHale, a noted union-busting law firm that reportedly helped Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;initially defeat&lt;/a&gt; its workers’ efforts to organize in Alabama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO4CIz"&gt;The DFEH also claims Activision Blizzard tried to get employees to sign away their ability to speak freely to investigators in waivers, “secret settlements,” and non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), which would require employees to notify Activision Blizzard before disclosing information about incidents covered by the NDA or settlements. They would also decide how much employees could freely say, giving the company the ability to “take all steps it deems to be appropriate to prevent or limit the required disclosure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GawM4h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The complaint now accuses the company of shredding “documents related to investigations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xh0vEW"&gt;Activision Blizzard has promised to try to fix its culture after its initial public response was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;panned by employees&lt;/a&gt;, who would later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;stage a walkout&lt;/a&gt;. In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;letter to employees published in late July&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s CEO promises that “anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.” The allegations in the updated complaint don’t paint a picture of a company working on fixing its culture, though. For its part, an &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-hr-shredded-documents"&gt;Activision Blizzard spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company didn’t shred any documents, and that it had preserved “information relevant to the DFEH investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obOY6C"&gt;The complaint has also been updated in several places to clarify that it’s not just full-time employees, but also temps and contingent workers that experienced sexual harassment and discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJnRvD"&gt;Apple’s AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. Both the AirPods and AirPods Pro are compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which isn’t always the case with even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The AirPods Max, the latest pair of headphones to join the AirPods lineup, are just as dependable, albeit at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Luckily, many of the most popular models routinely undergo a price cut. There are often sizable discounts available on the base model as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard second-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best AirPods deals available, including those on the AirPods AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. We’ll also include options for the AirPods model with the wireless charging case, if that’s something you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2RS0YX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="VFDHZw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;The AirPods are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. They usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted. Right now, for instance, you can find Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods for $119 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D1003525%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747976896193620917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PK1JRu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods (with wireless charging case)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with a wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one thing: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature, but, thankfully, chargers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Wireless-PowerWave-Upgraded-Fast-Charging/dp/B07THHQMHM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Wireless Charger&lt;/a&gt; are now relatively cheap. If you have no use for wireless charging, however, we recommend opting for the base AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AFyzAp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but be on the lookout for deals that bring the price down to $150 or below. Right now, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747977841356115870#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%3Fclkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the models above, offer noise cancellation, and support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spatial audio&lt;/a&gt;, a feature Apple recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rolled out to Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;. We think they’re the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; that iPhone owners can buy, regardless of the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bM8uVd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ci8unb"&gt;Thankfully, the AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their asking price of $249, and sometimes drop to as low as $180. The lowest price you can grab a pair for right now is $197 at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D0%26%26adid%3D22222222227317608597%26wl0%3D%26wl1%3Dg%26wl2%3Dc%26wl3%3D395477009936%26wl4%3Dpla-834433976587%26wl5%3D9061079%26wl6%3D%26wl7%3D%26wl8%3D%26wl9%3Dpla%26wl10%3D8175035%26wl11%3Donline%26wl12%3D520468661%26veh%3Dsem%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwr56IBhAvEiwA1fuqGoJTvXd60Wil7w2NpRvHJQwNPXUkWno3r0nNI2Z3XwNpX4tSWE601RoCuScQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $200 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1122332/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdTSzD"&gt;If you want to get an Apple Care Plus protection plan for your wireless earbuds, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1570785-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H is also selling a bundle that includes both for $239&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ears that have become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, wrapped in aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max have been discounted to under $450 in the past, there are currently few notable sales to speak of. You can, however, pick up a pair at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747975436149246309#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; right now for $50 off, their typical sale price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alaska Airlines evacuated a plane after a phone burst into flame</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G5YjJhmNfJA9h6tw6r0fPt6jJfg=/0x32:1000x699/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69771584/2_210618_sunset_15.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alaska Airlines airplanes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Alaska Airlines&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EgrbgQ"&gt;A cell phone caught fire in the cabin of an Alaska Airlines flight that had landed in Seattle from New Orleans on Monday evening. The phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21, Perry Cooper, a spokesperson for the Port of Seattle, &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/flight-to-seattle-evacuated-after-passengers-cellphone-catches-fire/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exEGF5"&gt;“After much digging, I can tell you that the phone was burned beyond recognition,” Cooper said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Seattle Times&lt;/em&gt;. “However, during an interview with one of our Port of Seattle Police officers, the passenger volunteered the phone was a Samsung Galaxy A21. Again, we could not confirm it by looking at the remains of the device.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aic3fY"&gt;Samsung did not immediately reply to a request for comment from The Verge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYxQMY"&gt;An Alaska Airlines spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the plane’s crew used fire extinguishers and a battery containment bag to “stop the phone from smoking.” Passengers were evacuated from the plane via the evacuation slides “due to hazy conditions inside the cabin,” and two of were treated at a local hospital, the spokesperson said. A Twitter user who said they were on the flight described the cabin as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264"&gt;“like a smoke machine.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XvBAZT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That’s me on my phone on the right. The passenger was 2-3 rows behind me on the opposite side. It was like a smoke machine. Flight attendants did an excellent job and all passengers were very calm. I believe one person sitting beside them might have minor injuries.&lt;/p&gt;— Maddy Harrison (@Madddzh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Madddzh/status/1430070384670347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8tRtd"&gt;Passengers were taken by bus to the terminal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/flySEA/status/1430032802825658374"&gt;according to a tweet by Seattle-Tacoma International Airport&lt;/a&gt;, and two passengers were treated at a local hospital, the Alaska Airlines spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6HKcR"&gt;While the situation may bring to mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12767670/samsung-galaxy-note-7-recall-fire-risk"&gt;Samsung’s recall of the Galaxy Note 7&lt;/a&gt; over fears of exploding batteries, it’s unclear if there’s any sort of common defect with any model of the A21 just yet. There have been many isolated incidents of phone batteries catching fire across many different brands. As for why those batteries can catch fire, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12841342/why-do-phone-batteries-explode-samsung-galaxy-note-7"&gt;here’s our explainer about why that happens&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
