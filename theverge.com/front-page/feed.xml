    <title>The Switch is getting new Mario Party and WarioWare games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZMFKHQDqGBo1VdghD6QIcEgDLGA=/169x0:1089x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456280/mpss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7L3S"&gt;During its E3 Direct, Nintendo announced new entries in the &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; series, both coming to the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0eY92"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will be a collection of classic &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; boards from the Nintendo 64, featuring (hopefully only the most infuriating) mini-games from both the N64 and GameCube eras. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-party-superstars-switch/"&gt;According to Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;, the mini-games can be played through online multiplayer and are compatible with regular controllers (unlike the recent &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-super-mario-party/"&gt;didn’t allow for the use&lt;/a&gt; of a Pro Controller or Switch Lite unless you had external Joy-Cons.) It will release on October 29th, 2021, for $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aVmeVR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Erdq0kiako4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p0YLA4"&gt;Nintendo also announced a new &lt;em&gt;WarioWare&lt;/em&gt; game called &lt;em&gt;Get It Together.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/warioware-get-it-together-switch/"&gt;Nintendo says&lt;/a&gt; it will feature over 200 tiny games, along with a story mode, which can be played alone or with a friend on the same system, or via local wireless co-op. &lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt; will release on September 10th, 2021, and will sell for $50. You can watch the trailer below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9NReGb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kxk6ijyr5Wk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>eBay’s sex ban wipes out an important storefront for queer collectors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a phone showing the eBay logo, set on top of a laptop keyboard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oi0Hh0g4H4vFMBfItL94NXOvcjE=/0x0:3543x2362/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456257/1229865757.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WQrWfq"&gt;Carta Monir, an author, publisher, and pornographer, maintains an amateur archive of vintage queer erotica: zines, comics, porn mags, classified ads, and other ephemera. “I think it’s really valuable to preserve and read these artifacts,” she says, “like people speaking to you from the perspective of the way that their community was at the time.” One of her favorite marketplaces for finding these materials is eBay, where she can consistently find a variety of old erotica for fairly cheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYvaRB"&gt;But starting today, Monir’s access to these materials is significantly reduced. eBay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436855/ebay-sex-ban-june-15"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt; that it would be removing the “Adult Only” category on June 15th. Under &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fhelp%2Fpolicies%2Fprohibited-restricted-items%2Frestricted-adult-items-policy%3Fid%3D4278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F15%2F22535109%2Febay-sex-ban-adult-only-queer-collectors" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the new policy&lt;/a&gt;, sellers aren’t allowed to list “items containing nudity and displays of sexual activitys” on the site. The policy makes exceptions for a few mainstream titles, including &lt;em&gt;Playboy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Playgirl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mayfair&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Penthouse&lt;/em&gt;, as long as the listing doesn’t contain nude images. eBay has already expanded that list to include several gay and lesbian magazines, including &lt;em&gt;Playguy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;On Our Backs&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;BUTT&lt;/em&gt;. But by and large, the policy has the effect of wiping out pornography from one of the internet’s biggest storefronts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9S2PF"&gt;The new rules at eBay echo policy changes over the years at other sites, including Tumblr and Patreon, which have banned or limited adult content. According to Monir and others, those policies tend to have the harshest impacts on queer communities and especially queer people who produce or buy erotic content outside of mainstream porn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Exu5ku"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The “Adult Only” section is already hard to find&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cjkI"&gt;eBay says its goal is to make adult items available to people “while preventing those who do not wish to view or purchase these items from easily accessing them.” But it’s already difficult, if not impossible, to accidentally stumble on the “Adult Only” section of eBay. It doesn’t appear in drop-down menus and is nested several categories deep. Users have to sign in, agree to continue, and enter a credit card to view it. eBay did not respond to a request for comment on the new restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTF0SY"&gt;Adult content bans usually aren’t decisions made entirely by sites themselves and are instead responses to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/4/18126112/tumblr-porn-ban-verizon-ad-goals-sex-work-fandom"&gt;advertising concerns&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;strict regulations&lt;/a&gt; from payment processors and credit card companies. In turn, those regulations are often influenced by lobbying from conservatives who point to sex trafficking and “save the children” arguments to cut down on porn. “There are undisguised evangelical anti-porn groups working extremely hard to ban pornography outright, and especially queer pornography,” says Monir, citing organizations like &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxqy4z/petition-shut-down-pornhub-trafficking-hub-earn-it"&gt;Exodus Cry&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing a section of eBay titled “Adult-Only Items” with subcategories for books, magazine back issues, DVDs, art, collectibles, and other items." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHwF14dwTByR0zu_bUuR2-os7p0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660227/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.15.57_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: eBay&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;eBay’s adult-only storefront.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IDCyWj"&gt;These bans aren’t just bad for collectors, but for artists. In 2008, eBay was one of the first places where Jade, a queer artist, managed to sell their erotic artwork. For several years before they started a webcomic, they would list smutty ink drawings on the site where people would buy them up within a few days. At the time, they remember thinking, “Wow, this is great, you can do anything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekC0xI"&gt;But things have been more fraught in the years since then. Jade still sells their work on other sites, but always with the worry that their livelihood will disappear if payment processors and credit card companies place further restrictions on the sale of erotica and porn. Patreon increased the enforcement of its adult content regulations in 2018 because of &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;pressure from payment partners&lt;/a&gt;, including PayPal, which is known to close people’s accounts and withhold the money in them. Jade requested a pseudonym for this article out of fear that PayPal would shut down their account because of its strict “sexually oriented goods” policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Gubz"&gt;Megan Gedris, another queer artist who makes erotic comics, has also felt the effects of adult content restrictions. Since Tumblr’s 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/3/18123752/tumblr-adult-content-porn-ban-date-explicit-changes-why-safe-mode"&gt;adult content ban&lt;/a&gt;, they’ve found it much harder to grow and maintain an audience for their work. They have two separate Patreon pages, one designated 18+ and one that’s not, because Patreon limits the exposure of 18+ accounts, and they worry mixing the two would make all of their work harder to find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t8zFCV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PjbOHk"&gt;Policies like the ones at eBay, Patreon, and Tumblr only compound the effects of FOSTA-SESTA, which were ostensibly passed to curb online sex trafficking but have mostly hurt &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom"&gt;sex workers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17360458/anti-sex-trafficking-law-fosta-sex-work-education-oschool"&gt;sex educators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/i-fear-loss-community-tumblr-s-new-adult-content-rules-n944196"&gt;queer communities&lt;/a&gt;, and erotic artists. “We know that the way that bans like this disproportionately target queer and marginalized forms of expression,” Monir says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGypjS"&gt;Gedris says crackdowns on adult content end up affecting indie creators the most, and it’s those creators who make erotic work that features disabled, fat, non-white, queer, and trans people. It’s important for people who rarely see bodies like theirs in mainstream porn to have access to erotic work that reflects their bodies and experiences. Jade says there’s been a boom of “amazing, beautiful queer erotica” in recent years, but there are still only a handful of publishers that will distribute it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcOoVD"&gt;There are other sites where Monir can dig around for her collection, but she says nothing compares to eBay. “It’s very frustrating because it effectively destroys one of the only reasonably priced large, eclectic marketplaces for vintage and archival content,” she says, “and drives that stuff into more specialized underground, expensive, less accessible venues.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y0rdm"&gt;Monir sees queer erotica not just as an important form of expression, but as a way to connect with queer people through history. Porn bans don’t come as a surprise, but the change at eBay hits particularly hard. “Seeing this stuff, feeling the passion and personal attention that was paid to it, and feeling the sense of community that comes from it, is very special,” she says. “And I am sad that people’s ability to just stumble onto stuff like this is going to be so much more curtailed and limited with this large marketplace going away.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CD Projekt says Cyberpunk 2077 will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNJOyNFFhZMC4mUl-NBHIm8Io8g=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456142/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tgNaCU"&gt;CD Projekt says &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will return to Sony’s PlayStation Store on June 21st, slightly more than six months after being removed. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22229742/cyberpunk-2077-returns-to-playstation-store-release-refund-ps4-ps5-cd-projekt-red"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, the news came in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/regulatory-announcements/current-report-no-34-2021/"&gt;regulatory disclosure&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s developer, CD Projekt Red’s parent company, saying Sony had agreed to reinstate the game. It did not immediately offer more details about its return, including potential bug fixes or other updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PJgpy"&gt;CD Projekt executives have said they frequently updated Sony on fixes for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s myriad bugs and performance issues since the game was pulled from the store on December 17th, 2020. The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356546/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-2-bug-fixes-console-stadia"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253990/cyberpunk-2077-new-1-11-update-hotfix-game-breaking-bug"&gt;numerous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt; for its console, PC, and Google Stadia editions; in late May, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cd-projekt-says-its-still-waiting-for-sonys-approval-to-bring-cyberpunk-back-to-the-playstation-store/"&gt;joint CEO Adam Kiciński told investors&lt;/a&gt; there’d been “visible progress” on stabilizing the game. But Kiciński said Sony would have to make the final call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Juyp0j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; was released in December &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397638/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-biggest-game-ever-sales"&gt;to strong sales&lt;/a&gt; but severe technical problems. The game struggled to run on last-generation Xbox One and PlayStation 4 consoles, and players faced numerous (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197547/cyberpunk-2077-glitches"&gt;frequently hilarious&lt;/a&gt;) bugs on every platform. Microsoft and Sony both offered refunds for the game, and Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189918/cyberpunk-2077-microsoft-store-listing-warning-label"&gt;added a warning label&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox One owners on its Xbox store. Sony took the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;more drastic step&lt;/a&gt; of pulling &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from its PlayStation Store entirely. Console owners could still buy physical discs, but CD Projekt has said that the digital version’s absence may have &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-playstation-store-removal-may-be-hurting-xbox-and-pc-sales-too-cd-projekt-says/"&gt;slowed down sales&lt;/a&gt; on Xbox and PC as well as PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GnmYp"&gt;CD Projekt Red spent nearly a decade designing &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, and it &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cd-projekt-committed-fixing-cyberpunk-2077-so-it-can-sell-for-years-2021-04-12/"&gt;calls the game&lt;/a&gt; a long-term investment that it can sell for “years to come.” The studio has &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/cd-projekt-red-reconsidering-cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-102937559.html"&gt;backed away from plans&lt;/a&gt; for a standalone multiplayer mode, saying it would focus on adding online features to all its games instead. But it’s promised downloadable content for &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s single-player campaign, plus a major upgrade for new consoles — including the PlayStation 5 — in the second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is releasing a Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch handheld</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lFHH_NSHqTbcqmMmfXs8r1BcKPo=/0x0:2139x1426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456064/tlozgameandwatch.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DA68Su"&gt;For the 35th anniversary of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo is releasing a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-themed green and gold Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld console with four playable built-in games. You’ll be able to play the first entry in &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; series, followed by its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;. The fourth game is the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Vermin &lt;/em&gt;game, but with Link’s character imposed over the original character. Additionally, it can be used as a digital clock or timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHeakW"&gt;The handheld will release on November 12th for $49.99. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430625/game-and-watch-nintendo-super-mario-bros-35th-anniversary-handheld-console-closer-look"&gt;The previous Game &amp;amp; Watch console&lt;/a&gt; released for Mario’s 35th anniversary had three games, including the original &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Super Mario Bros. 2&lt;/em&gt;, and the Game &amp;amp; Watch &lt;em&gt;Ball &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mv8f-6fNrGcCkofPoEi2MyIwCOY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660319/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FwGyEY"&gt;This version has a similar design and color LCD display found in the &lt;em&gt;Mario&lt;/em&gt; version, but it’s unique in that it has a start and select button for navigating the &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;games. Unless Nintendo changed its strategy, it likely has a USB-C charging port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sz7a08"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this harrowing story about the team cleaning up Airbnb’s biggest disasters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pVVJW2uDMOjLcrSXRs4To8ksR8Q=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456024/Airbnb_Logo_Over_Gradient.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hgO5L7"&gt;When Airbnb works smoothly, the platform can feel like simply an eclectic hotel chain. But the app is a huge, high-stakes experiment in trusting strangers, and that can come with a heavy price. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-15/airbnb-spends-millions-making-nightmares-at-live-anywhere-rentals-go-away"&gt;An article from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;journalist Olivia Carville&lt;/a&gt; makes that price vividly clear, delving into the workings of Airbnb’s safety team — the group that cleans up after Airbnb users’ most horrific experiences, including sexual assaults and murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uFpXdl"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; article cites interviews with current and former Airbnb employees, who describe an intensely stressful balance of helping customers and protecting Airbnb’s public image. It reports that Airbnb spends around $50 million annually in payouts to hosts and guests. Airbnb says most of that money covers property damage claims, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it also covers cases like a $7 million settlement with a woman who rented a New York apartment and was raped by a stranger who had a set of duplicate keys. After the incident in New York, Airbnb’s now-former crisis management head says he pushed it to ban hosts from leaving keys at local shops — but that he was allegedly overruled in part because it could discourage hosts from continuing to use the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3XAPE"&gt;The story notes that conventional hotels aren’t immune to crime. But &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says that Airbnb has unique issues. It’s harder to implement centralized rules that could make guests safer, like digital keypads that would have prevented duplicating keys. It generally relies on a vetting system rather than direct on-site security. Even if the system works the vast majority of the time, its scale of 5.6 million listings can add up to a lot of bad experiences for individual users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mJ6VJ"&gt;Meanwhile, Airbnb is fighting long-running regulatory battles that &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggests encourages it to sweep problems under the rug, offering payouts for users’ silence. (Airbnb denied that suggestion in a comment to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.) “The only thing that really motivates them is the threat or potential threat of bad PR or a nightmare in the press,” complains the lawyer of one person whose son was killed in a shooting at an Airbnb rental. Once an initial crisis is over, “they don’t care anymore, because the news cycle has moved on.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is remastering the first two Advance Wars games for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E6OX9pbiQ_h1zw7RWRcA6UkVg2c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69456010/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_9.47.45_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G2klMm"&gt;Nintendo announced that it’s remastering the first two games in the &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; series for Nintendo Switch in one package under the banner &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp&lt;/em&gt;. The game is scheduled to launch on December 3rd, and you can preorder it beginning Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjE3lo"&gt;The games are “fully rebuilt from the ground up,” and in the trailer shown during the presentation, you can see the game’s great new 3D graphics. But it also looks like the classic grid-based strategy gameplay is intact almost exactly as you might remember. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tToU8B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ADVANCE WARS. IS. BACK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising campaigns return in one package, fully rebuilt from the ground up for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitch&lt;/a&gt;! Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp launches 12/3. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R7b01QzYGe"&gt;https://t.co/R7b01QzYGe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gcBeVExa8x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gcBeVExa8x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1404840256776683530?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="toYtfb"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; game came out in 2001 on the Game Boy Advance, and the second hit in 2003. I played hours and hours of both games as a kid — they were some of the first strategy games I ever enjoyed — so I’m looking forward to getting my hands on these remasters when they’re released for the Switch in December. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Breath of the Wild 2 heads to the skies in stunning E3 trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/58sm5uKKT6KOPeGI_OOl7u_ekAM=/0x0:821x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455952/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BfCWI3"&gt;After years of anticipation, Nintendo has revealed a new trailer for the still-untitled upcoming sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; at E3 2021, along with a 2022 release date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1YUPY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; was a launch title for the Switch, and it reinvented the now-35-year-old franchise with an open-world model that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/17/14957460/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-future-games"&gt;broke new ground in the genre&lt;/a&gt; and is wildly considered one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review"&gt;most acclaimed games of all time&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0CSoSdQon4l0EOVSEXbSpUBKG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660293/Screen_Shot_2021_06_15_at_12.38.03_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b8k8v6"&gt;That’s a long way of saying that there’s a lot riding on the sequel, which Nintendo announced over two years ago at E3 2019 with a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fr1Z07AV00"&gt;surprise teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;. It featured the return of Link and Zelda from &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild,&lt;/em&gt; along with what appeared to be longtime series villain Ganondorf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cVUP1P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo is working on a full sequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="teuA1w"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; sequel isn’t Nintendo’s only major Zelda project in the works: the company is also working on an HD rerelease of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which was originally released for the Nintendo Wii, planned for release on July 16th. The &lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt; port offers improved graphics and a new control scheme to allow players to play the Wii Remote-focused title with a traditional controller.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first three Super Monkey Ball games are getting remastered</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ccZsVf3gYugQGYBjjEuK9Yjkm28=/26x0:871x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455848/SMBBM_Key_Art___Landscape.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A collage of images from &lt;/em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania. | Image: Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zpRaz"&gt;Sega on Tuesday announced &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania, &lt;/em&gt;a “modern HD remaster” of &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;that will be releasing on October 5th for Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S, and PC. The announcement arrives ahead of the 20th anniversary of the first game’s original release on June 23rd, 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MpWOd"&gt;The meat of the &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Monkey Ball &lt;/em&gt;series consists of navigating increasingly challenging mazes as adorable monkeys rolling around in transparent balls. But these three games also had some ridiculous multiplayer mini-games that I spent hours on as a kid, such as bowling, billiards, and even golf. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AGOR2tChWloLlyBOK0ywCpyOivw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22653931/Mini_Game___Soccer.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sega&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soccer is one of the mini-games you can play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8ejEPP"&gt;Sega says &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; will include more than 300 recreated levels and refined versions of the 12 multiplayer mini-games from the original games. Those 12 multiplayer games won’t be playable online, though — they’re four-player local multiplayer only, Sega tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The remaster does have online leaderboards and an online time attack mode, however.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech antitrust pioneer Lina Khan confirmed as FTC commissioner</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Considers Nominees For NASA Administrator And Federal Trade Commissioner" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TFsorOolkU6Mfx6sPkv29HlR6g=/0x0:5305x3537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455831/1232440387.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lbqfEh"&gt;The Senate confirmed Lina Khan as commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission Tuesday, by a vote of 69-28. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/22/president-biden-announces-his-intent-to-nominate-lina-khan-for-commissioner-of-the-federal-trade-commission/"&gt;First nominated in March&lt;/a&gt;, Khan will give Democrats a majority on the commission, filling a vacancy left by Republican appointee Joseph Simons who resigned in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6CDH3"&gt;Khan’s appointment signals an increased focus on antitrust regulation against major tech companies, which has been a focus of her legal scholarship. Khan rose to prominence after a 2017 paper, &lt;a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox"&gt;titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox,”&lt;/a&gt; arguing that new antitrust statutes were necessary to prevent anti-competitive behavior from online platforms like Amazon. More recently, Khan played a significant staff role in assembling &lt;a href="https://judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/competition_in_digital_markets.pdf"&gt;the House Antitrust report on competition in digital markets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBSJNV"&gt;Khan’s confirmation comes at a time when Congress is preparing to take drastic action to curb the power big tech companies have on digital markets. Just last week, the House antitrust subcommittee &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529857/democrats-antitrust-big-tech-facebook-amazon-google-apple-competition-package-bills"&gt;released a slew of bipartisan bills&lt;/a&gt; addressing a variety of concerns unveiled in last year’s report — one that Khan played a significant role in investigating. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/06/15/klobuchar-starts-work-on-companion-antitrust-bills-795951?cid=su_tw_mt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) is working to put out companion bills in the Senate similar to those produced by the House last week. One of those bills would give antitrust enforcers more money and authority to go after tech monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpvpsF"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission has struggled to rein in tech giants — most notably with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;Facebook’s $5 billion Cambridge Analytica fine&lt;/a&gt;, which many saw as insufficient to the scale of the misconduct. Congress has put forward a number of measures to try to expand the FTC’s powers, in the hopes that the commission will become a more aggressive regulator against anti-competitive behavior. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/2/senator-klobuchar-introduces-sweeping-bill-to-promote-competition-and-improve-antitrust-enforcement"&gt;the Competition and Antitrust Law Enforcement Reform Act&lt;/a&gt; put forward by Klobuchar proposed funding for a new branch of the commission devoted entirely to retroactive merger review and studies of current market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEKwZi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QGP8m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid Dread is real, and it’s coming to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8TpAK07qxcPVatzAgBzhl567wkI=/169x0:1969x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69455827/metroid_dread.6.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jp4V3d"&gt;At its E3 2021 Nintendo Direct presentation, Nintendo revealed a new entry in the Metroid series: &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;. It’s set to release on October 8th of this year &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-dread-switch/"&gt;for $59.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="us7jka"&gt;In a short but action-packed trailer, protagonist Samus Aran faced off against a giant and terrifying white robot that chased her throughout the level. The game looked to play similarly to the 3DS game &lt;em&gt;Metroid: Samus Returns — &lt;/em&gt;but it’s actually a direct sequel to the  Game Boy Advance title &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion &lt;/em&gt;from 2002, where Samus similarly had to avoid the terrifying SA-X.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dy4yRTAJTiKdhBwDc2hy9KNCC6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22660339/phantom_cloak_metroid_dread.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cgfFVs"&gt;Here, Samus will have some intriguing abilities to help her get around. Right from the get-go, she’ll be able to slide through small passages. She can turn on a cloaking device named the Phantom Cloak to help her evade detection, and there’s a new tool called a Spider Magnet that allows her to climb up certain walls and ceilings. Producer Sakamoto Yoshio shows off some of the new features in the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zp7yXu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/afUI8nIrGgI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8olHat"&gt;While it’s a 2D platformer game, it appears to have a lot of 3D sequences as well — you can watch Nintendo’s Treehouse team play through a portion of the game at the end of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQz_ECTGGyA"&gt;Nintendo Direct video&lt;/a&gt;, the company is offering more details in “Dread Reports,” the first of which &lt;a href="https://metroid.nintendo.com/news/#!/metroid-dread-report-vol--1--a-closer-look-at-the-reveal-trailer"&gt;you can read here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TpjkW"&gt;Nintendo also shared that the company is still at work on &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 4&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which was first revealed for Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017"&gt;in a brief video in June 2017&lt;/a&gt; — yes, four years ago. That game  is likely still a ways out from release, as it was rebooted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"&gt;January 2019&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that announcement, Nintendo said that it had put Retro Studios, the developers of the original &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, back at the helm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="egDBOH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo reboots Metroid Prime 4 development with new studio","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197164/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-delay-release-date"},{"title":"Metroid Prime 4 is coming to Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782806/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-announced-e3-2017"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AT04Kp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 1:11PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more details from Nintendo.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
