    <title>Apple is working on Apple Pay Later to help you buy things without paying for them yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0xgJX3lgPdkm7BYKRsOH2akz8oA=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69577207/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqoVTD"&gt;Even if you haven’t signed up for the Apple Card, you may soon be able to put your purchases on Apple’s tab. Apple is teaming up with Goldman Sachs yet again to turn every Apple Pay transaction into a potential “buy now, pay later” opportunity, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/apple-goldman-plan-buy-now-pay-later-service-to-rival-paypal"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — no Apple Card needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RIe9Z"&gt;You know how many online checkout counters across the web tempt you to pay &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/23/16516792/affirm-mobile-app-lending-money-launch-virtual-credit-card"&gt;with Affirm&lt;/a&gt; or Klarna or PayPal’s Pay In 4 instead of coughing up the full purchase price at the start,  then they charge you in installments instead? It sounds like this Apple service will be a direct competitor — with the important distinction that this will be baked into hundreds of millions of Apple devices that many people are already using to tap to pay at gobs of physical stores, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tLQjC"&gt;You’ll pay in four interest-free installments over two weeks if you pick “Apple Pay in 4” or pay interest over several months if you pick “Apple Pay Monthly Installments,” writes &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg. &lt;/em&gt;It adds&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no credit check required, and some plans won’t have late fees. The publication doesn’t say when Apple might launch the service or how much interest it might charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9PgBgW"&gt;Apple putting people in debt feels like the ultimate form of lock-in, and it might rub some the wrong way, but the company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282946/apple-card-credit-post-iphone-strategy-services-business-digital-wallet-payments"&gt;a knack for sprucing up boring products in the pursuit of services revenue&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s true of Apple Pay Later the way it was true of the Apple Card, there’ll likely be plenty of people who will take Apple’s slightly friendlier terms over the financial industry’s status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6fhbue"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6mbwG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram launches Security Checkup for people whose accounts have been hacked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three phone screens showing Instagram tabs titled “Security Checkup” that include prompts to review contact info, connected accounts, and profile information. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sh3llJMsrshF-hVRhcNutAMXZdw=/26x0:1556x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576865/206777573_332496735079286_5739390584905507635_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instagram’s Security Checkup&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/keeping-instagram-safe-and-secure?ref=shareable" target="_blank"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DyCz8a"&gt;Instagram introduced a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/keeping-instagram-safe-and-secure?ref=shareable"&gt;new security check&lt;/a&gt; today for any people whose accounts have been hacked before. People with previously compromised accounts will see a prompt when they log in asking if they want to start a security checkup. The feature walks users through security steps, including confirming other accounts that share login information, reviewing login activity, and keeping recovery contact information updated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93qCDz"&gt;Instagram is also planning to add support for two-factor authentication through WhatsApp, in addition to its current options of phone numbers and authenticator apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTyNWh"&gt;Instagram says there’s been an uptick in accounts claiming to be Instagram in direct messages to get people to share their passwords. Instagram only sends emails, and you can check to see if an email’s authentic by looking at the “Emails from Instagram” tab in settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jfvcSC"&gt;The streamlined security feature is rolling out in the middle of &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/25/dont-let-these-easy-to-get-back-on-instagram-emails-freak-you-out-your-account-hasnt-been-hacked/"&gt;a recent wave&lt;/a&gt; of password reset emails that have been cluttering some people’s inboxes. The emails are legitimately from Instagram and are likely from bots trying to access a bunch of accounts at once. They’re annoying if you get several of them at a time, but they don’t mean your account has been hacked. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches its Workspace tier for individuals in five countries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHlLRwU0WKURBAB4BRMWMZSt4i8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576815/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfFASK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://workspace.google.com/individual/"&gt;Google Workspace Individual&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s Workspace plan designed to give one-person businesses access to some premium features in the software suite, is now available in five countries (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/12/google-workspace-individual-launch/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbHi5m"&gt;With Workspace Individual, you’ll be able to host group meetings in Google Meet for longer than 60 minutes on a computer as well as record Meet calls and use noise cancellation. Workspace Individual also makes it easy to let others schedule time on your Google Calendar, thanks to shareable booking pages. And professional and customizable email layouts in Gmail are “coming soon” to the Workspace tier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c9nXXO"&gt;Workspace Individual is available if you live in Brazil, Canada, Japan, Mexico, and the US, according to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-workspace-individual/answer/10758004?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=10713204"&gt;Google support doc&lt;/a&gt;, and you can try it out now at no cost with a 14-day free trial. When it comes time to pay, the plan typically costs $9.99 per month, but through January 2022, Google is knocking $2 off the monthly price, meaning you’ll pay $7.99 per month instead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can’t make fun of Gogo’s airline internet anymore — because it changed the name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zftWfZHDW7hZo-cDgVeSY6WGcY=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576791/gogo-internet-logo-stock1_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dX9IuI"&gt;If you’ve ever purchased inflight Wi-Fi in the United States, there’s a good chance you’ve cursed Gogo’s name. But now, you’ll have to direct your anger at Intelsat instead: &lt;a href="https://www.intelsat.com/newsroom/gogo-commercial-aviation-is-now-intelsat/"&gt;it’s the new name of the consumer chunk of the inflight internet company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGcK4y"&gt;Technically, Intelsat is also the name of that chunk’s owner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21410368/gogo-sells-inflight-internet-business-intelsat-bankrupt"&gt;a bankrupt satellite operator that purchased the inflight internet’s consumer brand in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, at a time when both companies were struggling with the realities of travel at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gogo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21230133/gogo-furloughs-60-percent-workforce-passenger-air-travel-collapse"&gt;furloughed 60 percent of its workforce&lt;/a&gt; in April 2020 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350251/gogo-layoffs-furloughs-airlines-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;laid off 14 percent of its workers&lt;/a&gt; that July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKZwiF"&gt;The Gogo brand will likely still live on &lt;a href="https://ir.gogoair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gogo-offer-business-aviations-first-unlimited-streaming-and-data"&gt;for “business aviation,”&lt;/a&gt; however, as Gogo Business Aviation, LLC is now a separate company with its “Gogo Biz” offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btJC0b"&gt;If you’ve had a crappy consumer Gogo experience, it may have been due to airlines not keeping the service up and running — I certainly remember a few flights where they never turned it on as planned — but it may have also been the limitations of Gogo’s aging technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C1dBJG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not all Gogo was equal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1qxfq"&gt;The company relies on both a network of ground-to-air cellular towers and satellite connections to work, both of which can be spotty and slow: the cellular towers, in particular, only deliver a 3G cellular connection that has to be shared across the entire plane, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/11/12/3636842/gogo-atg-4-in-flight-internet"&gt;topped out at 9.8Mbps per aircraft&lt;/a&gt;. While Gogo Biz was serving &lt;a href="https://www.ainonline.com/sponsored-content/business-aviation/2020-06-10/power-five-gogo-avance-hits-five-key-aspects-inflight-connectivity"&gt;some 900 private aircraft&lt;/a&gt; with 4G by June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;its 5G plans have been delayed till 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5AgzN"&gt;For consumers, the service’s 2Ku satellite connections have been far faster at up to 100Mbps per plane, but it still depends on how many passengers are using it: in 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/gogo-2ku-airplane-wifi-pictures/7/"&gt;I managed to hit 15Mbps and use the internet on four simultaneous devices&lt;/a&gt; aboard a Gogo test flight, but that was with only a handful of journalists aboard the plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoUkZI"&gt;Intelsat will compete with other established satellite providers and possibly with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink&lt;/a&gt;, too. Last month, Starlink’s VP &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526601/elon-musk-spacex-starlink-internet-talks-commercial-airlines-in-flight-wifi"&gt;publicly revealed SpaceX is in talks with several airlines&lt;/a&gt; and is designing its own airborne antennas.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google slashes Stadia’s revenue share to try to attract developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9TmPR7HBxHP07UkssT35ddEot3M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576554/akrales_191113_3779_0284.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PLMLVP"&gt;Google is revising how much of a cut it takes from Stadia games in a bid to try to attract more developers. Starting on October 1st, Google will take 15 percent of sales up to $3 million through the end of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oJa4Vi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I0oNK-XHp0I?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=319&amp;amp;start=319" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e6iQcy"&gt;With the change, Google seems to be trying to make its cloud gaming platform a more enticing option for developers — a proposition that has likely become much harder since the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its own in-house studios&lt;/a&gt;. Google has also tried offering exclusive games to try to bring developers on board (which it presumably paid hefty sums to acquire), but many of those games &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/16/stadia-exclusive-games-available-xbox-playstation-nintendo/"&gt;have since been released on other platforms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0pfrs"&gt;The news comes as revenue shares between developers and platform holders have come under intense scrutiny as of late. Google’s change with Stadia isn’t the first it’s made recently for its stores: the company reduced its Play Store cut to 15 percent for a developer’s first $1 million in annual revenue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt;. That move followed a similar one from Apple in November, which announced that developers who earn less than $1 million per year on the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;would qualify for a program&lt;/a&gt; where Apple would take a 15 percent cut of their revenues instead of the standard 30 percent fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63jMJF"&gt;Tuesday’s news was announced at the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0oNK-XHp0I&amp;amp;list=PLOU2XLYxmsIIb7hcy-YBGDlCxq8LyRdVA&amp;amp;index=1"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the event, on Monday, Google announced that Android 12 will let you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573033/google-android-12-games-download-dashboard-developer-summit"&gt;play games as you’re downloading them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple just launched an official $99 MagSafe battery pack for the iPhone 12 lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEfRxBW8iTYh7R0OOqdpnq9_tFI=/0x30:2052x1398/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576513/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_9.56.00_AM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4KJcDV"&gt;Apple has launched the MagSafe Battery Pack for its iPhone 12 lineup. One of the magnetic batteries costs $99, and you can order one &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMJWY3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-battery-pack%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now from Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. For me, the website is showing delivery between July 22nd and July 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPH0mk"&gt;Apple has released battery cases for iPhones in the past, but the new pack attaches to the iPhone 12 phones thanks to embedded magnets. And it will work with all four of the phones in the iPhone 12 family — the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARo_k-GReC54LvtfihaLu6EYvzg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22715091/MJWY3_AV1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One side of the MagSafe Battery Pack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AepQM"&gt;While the iPhone 11 battery cases had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974475/apple-iphone-11-pro-max-camera-smart-battery-case-shortcut-button"&gt;physical camera shortcut button&lt;/a&gt;, since this accessory is just an attachable pack, that means it doesn’t come with any other features for your phone besides giving you some extra juice. But if it works like the MagSafe wireless charger, you might also be able to use the pack to top up your AirPods or other devices that support Qi wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHGFx6"&gt;Apple says the pack charges with up to 5W of power, so it won’t be the fastest way to charge your phone. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212174"&gt;In a support page&lt;/a&gt;, Apple also says the battery requires iOS 14.7 — a software update that’s not out yet. Since Apple’s website is showing delivery times for the battery pack for as early as July 22nd, it seems like that update will be out soon to support it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u31Zpm"&gt;Apple also offers a &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMK0E3ZM%2FA%2Fiphone-leather-wallet-with-magsafe-arizona%3Fafid%3Dp239%257C10078%26cid%3Daos-us-aff-ir&amp;amp;sharedid=AppleMagSafeBatteryVerge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wallet that can stick magnetically onto the back of your phone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwn2Mg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 13th, 1:14PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added details of charging speed and that the pack requires iOS 14.7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Republicans call for Amazon to testify on Pentagon relationship</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OifnVL"&gt;Republicans are questioning Amazon’s relationship with the Pentagon after newly released emails show that defense officials praised tech executives vying for a $10 billion contract during the Trump administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92PnzZ"&gt;On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/us/politics/amazon-jedi-contract.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on previously unreleased emails that show Pentagon officials applauding Amazon executives while the company sought out a lucrative defense contract between 2017 and 2018. The Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure project, or JEDI, set out to find a tech company that would move the Defense Department’s computer networks over to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1FiF6"&gt;In one instance, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/us/politics/amazon-jedi-contract.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that former Trump Defense Secretary Jim Mattis traveled to Silicon Valley to meet with executives from companies like Apple, Amazon, and Google in 2017. During this trip, Mattis was made “uncomfortable” while Amazon representatives aggressively pitched their cloud-computing products to him. A former Mattis adviser, Sally Donnelly, also referred to Bezos as “the genius of our age.” Donnelly, who later sent Mattis a list of reasons he should meet with Bezos, had previously worked at a consulting firm where her clients included Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZPGmy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is exactly what we were concerned about”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSQDiB"&gt;“This is exactly what we were concerned about, and it contradicts Amazon’s insistence that there is nothing to see here,” Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) said in a joint statement Tuesday. “It’s become more and more clear that Amazon used its market power and paid-for connections to circumvent ethical boundaries and avoid competition in an attempt to win this contract.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdyau8"&gt;Microsoft won the multibillion-dollar contract in 2019 after a closely watched bidding fight between Amazon. In the months leading up to the contract’s winner announcement, former President Donald Trump dialed up his criticism of Amazon founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, accusing the Bezos-owned &lt;em&gt;Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;of unfair media coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VK5FWo"&gt;But earlier this month, the Defense Department announced that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/06/technology/JEDI-contract-cancelled.html"&gt;it would cancel its contract&lt;/a&gt; amid an ongoing legal battle alleging that Trump wrongfully interfered in the bidding process. In canceling the prior contract, Amazon is given a second chance to win the $10 billion deal. But Republicans in Washington are calling for the company to testify regarding its Pentagon relationships in light of the newly released emails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woSvPm"&gt;“Now, more than ever, we need to ask Amazon, under oath, whether it tried to improperly influence the largest federal contract in history,” the lawmakers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C81bVy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgzBxT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11 is full of delightful detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdhOQzt4TyF-I_LZIWvUiJwOmys=/0x100:600x500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576125/windows11animations.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SaVnKH"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;Windows 11 preview&lt;/a&gt; has been available for a couple of weeks now, but I’m still discovering new animations and details in this new OS that put a smile on my face. While the new Start menu and centered taskbar are the obvious changes in Windows 11 that you’ll notice straight away, it’s the small animations throughout the OS that really make it feel a lot more fresh and alive than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrYuFo"&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;started detailing&lt;/a&gt; some of the design approaches it has used for Windows 11 and its &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRHkSraHhTA/"&gt;attention to detail for daily micro-interactions&lt;/a&gt;. That includes things like a checkbox that has an animated tick to subtly let you know when you interact with it, or a settings cog that spins when you hover over it. Plenty of buttons in Windows 11 pop with faint signs of life or bounce as you move around the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s82-gwVEIYem2h081qCsKU98LuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714875/windows11button.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Windows 11 button pops into life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/52fLGKG9SrDzD87iCsgj5xww4bE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714879/windows11pop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These tiny animations can be found throughout Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C5VXVr"&gt;It’s this attention to detail that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"&gt;makes Windows 11 feel fresh and new&lt;/a&gt; but still familiar to use on a daily basis. The animations are often playful but in equal parts useful to provide an important visual cue for what you’re interacting with. Thankfully, they’re not in your face, slow, or annoying, mostly because Microsoft designed them to be calming. “Calmness is much needed in today’s world... Windows 11 facilitates this through foundational experiences that feel familiar, soften formerly intimidating UI, and increase emotional connection,” &lt;a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/windows-11-designing-the-next-generation-of-windows-490c02fb6373"&gt;says Microsoft’s design team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7YRvyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Windows 11 is a new and refreshing approach to an old and familiar home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22557060/microsoft-windows-11-hands-on-preview"},{"title":"Microsoft releases Windows 11 preview, available to download now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22553639/microsoft-windows-11-download-available-preview-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5gVYmW"&gt;While the subtle animations might be calming, the choice to center the taskbar and change the Start menu is the more striking change in Windows 11. “After listening to people express a need for more efficiency and less noise when using Start, we designed a cleaner and simpler experience that puts people at the center by prioritizing the apps they love and the documents they need,” says Microsoft’s design team. “It also adapts to modern device form factors and enables easier access for all screen sizes, from a Surface Go to an ultrawide monitor.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SQwMy_37u1vf8OR4648a6ThS55A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714884/windows11startmenucompare.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft Design&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Windows 11 Start menu versus Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2xCqEK"&gt;Windows 11 also improves the out-of-box experience (OOBE) of when you set up a machine for the first time. The settings you configure are a lot more useful than in Windows 10, including naming your PC and setting up a PC for how you intend to use it. Sometimes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22338205"&gt;it’s the little things that count&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HO5LTJ"&gt;Microsoft has also added rounded corners to most parts of Windows 11, new iconography, and an updated Segoe UI Variable font. Like most of Windows 11, these are subtle changes that you only really start to notice after using the OS for a few days. Microsoft even worked with design studio &lt;a href="https://sixnfive.com/"&gt;Six N Five&lt;/a&gt; to create most of the wallpapers you’ll see in Windows 11. They’re mostly centered to match the Start menu. “We want your journey into Windows 11 to be literally centered from the start,” says Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOjaCl"&gt;The Windows 11 design certainly isn’t perfect, though. It’s a work in progress, but there’s still a lot of inconsistency in this preview that needs to be ironed out. At times, it still feels like Microsoft is mashing together Windows from a decade ago with this modern and simple UI. There’s a lot that goes into overhauling something as big and sprawling as Windows, so hopefully the final product smooths up some of the early and rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why small design decisions can matter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/17G7ICTe46Jq7FmIdSSxdFV23Io=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576081/vpavic_4547_20210421_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tci1Is"&gt;While we usually look for major features in a device — speed or sound quality or picture sharpness — sometimes it’s the little things that can make or break your experience with that device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOmJGb"&gt;I realized this recently when I bought myself a pair of Jabra Elite 75t earbuds for day-to-day use. I really liked my new earbuds. But while my previous headset came with a detachable loop that you could use to attach it to a bag or a keyring or whatever, the Jabra case has no way of attaching to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IkyroV"&gt;Now, I wasn’t about to return the earbuds because of this, but it did cause me to growl a little. In order to get that same convenient functionality I had enjoyed with my previous earbuds, I had to buy a cheap silicone cover for the case — one that came with a carabiner that I could hook onto my bag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2klN3s"&gt;It also started me thinking about other easily overlooked design features that we may not even think about when we buy a device but become issues once we start using the device on a day-to-day basis. For example, about five seconds after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22570161/apple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; hit the market, it was followed by a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394331/apple-airtag-release-launch-accessory-roundup-nomad-belkin"&gt;veritable onslaught of accessories&lt;/a&gt; (a number of them made by Apple itself) with one purpose and one purpose only: to fix the fact that the AirTag doesn’t come with a hole so that you can attach it to anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A rugged AirTag case from Spigen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8DcdqCayePsBxP8zc6ye9XhXgWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457915/detail_airtags_rugged_armor_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Spigen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rugged AirTag case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2njEARZjRJCslErK-S4v0w2nUg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22714856/Screen_Shot_2021_07_13_at_11.21.53_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Aotao&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case with carabiner for the Jabra Elite 75t.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx8ONJ"&gt;Of course, you can look at the positive viewpoint: that, as with my Jabra Elite 75t, the lack of a convenient attachment provides a lot of companies with an additional source of income. And after all, what’s another few dollars added to the cost of something as nifty as the AirTag? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpNgAD"&gt;That is until you consider there are design decisions out there that are just as unnecessary but convenient and are included with the device. In fact, some of these are features you may not even know were needed until you realize how useful they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9wOKbf"&gt;Here’s an example: I’m one of those people who tends to have a tangle of plugged-in white and black cables in several corners of my home — tangles that I have to search every time I want to, say, use a USB-C cable for my phone or the power cable for my MacBook. Most of the time, I have to pick up one of the cables and follow it to the end to make sure it’s the one I need. However, I can find the cable for my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; laptop in a couple of seconds because the end of the cable has a small LED that is always lit when the other end is plugged into power, making it really easy to find. Dell didn’t have to put that LED in there — but I’m incredibly glad it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BA9jmE"&gt;There are loads of other small design pluses that are out there making life just a little bit easier for many of us, like ridges on the bottom of laptops to make it a little easier to carry the thing without dropping it (and simultaneously making it more comfortable to type on) or low-tech shutters that can block off the camera on the Echo Show 8 to provide that extra bit of privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbBgSV"&gt;Perhaps the conclusion to be drawn from this is even the smaller design decisions that are made when creating a new tech device can affect our feeling about that product — maybe even enough so that we as consumers might take those decisions into consideration when the next model comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xgx5p6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx2Z27"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram tests a ‘reshare’ sticker, which actually makes it harder to share posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jz_o5RkCCtK1IYXNf3ACVetbEqE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69576046/reshare.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9eRaUr"&gt;Instagram doesn’t want you to spam your friends with all of the posts you come across and like. So today, it’s starting a test to make sharing to Stories slightly trickier. The company is testing a “reshare” sticker that can be placed in Stories. When selected, a “recently viewed” tab will surface and let users choose from posts they’ve seen in the last hour, saved, or posted, which they can then share in their story. They can insert IGTV, reels, and feed video content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW17xu"&gt;You can get an idea of what the test looks like in the image above. Previously, if you wanted to share a feed post to your story, you had to so manually from the post itself. This test will replace that functionality, effectively requiring you to navigate away from the post itself and into the create mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9cIur"&gt;An Instagram spokesperson says the test is designed to make people more “intentional” and “deliberate” about what they post. Presumably, this means they don’t want people to just tap a share button from a post and instead are introducing slightly more friction to do so. At the same time, Instagram likely wants people to engage more with content on the app, and this might raise the bar of what people see and, therefore, get them to tap through on various photos and videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Zp4Yj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
