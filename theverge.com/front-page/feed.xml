    <title>Tesla hit with another lawsuit alleging sexual harassment, and retaliation by management</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzUm8L"&gt;A second Tesla employee within one month has filed a lawsuit alleging sexual harassment at the workplace, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sued-by-second-female-worker-over-sexual-harassment-retaliation-2021-12-10/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-second-female-worker-fremont-factory-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Erica Cloud, an assembly line worker at Tesla, filed a lawsuit in California’s Alameda County Superior Court, claiming that she experienced “continuous and pervasive” sexual harassment in the factory where she worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1JLYAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6on69t"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Cloud’s lawsuit alleges that her manager hugged and massaged her, and claims that she was also subject to her manager’s vulgar and sexual remarks. It also accuses Tesla of not doing enough to address possible sexual harassment in the workplace. Cloud’s managers are allegedly retaliating against her after she brought up the issue to human resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yqI14"&gt;This comes just after Jessica Barraza, a production associate at Tesla, filed a lawsuit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791321/worker-sues-tesla-rampant-sexual-harassment-fremont-elon-musk"&gt;accusing the company of “rampant sexual harassment”&lt;/a&gt; at its Fremont, CA factory. Barraza’s lawsuit claims that she was inappropriately touched, catcalled, and subject to sexual comments at the workplace. She also alleges that her managers knew about the harassment, and partook in the same type of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bi4sf"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;Tesla was ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; in connection to another incident at its Fremont factory. Owen Diaz, a Black former elevator operator at the company said he experienced racial harassment and discrimination. Tesla employees later &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/14/tesla-class-action-lawsuit-alleges-racism-unsafe-factory-conditions.html"&gt;proposed a class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; alleging racism at the Fremont factory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to stop Alexa from ruining holiday surprises  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Np0Pk4DDbpvj8MyeIH1aPTcUbWY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261475/jtuohy_20211211_4924_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echo smart displays — like this Echo Show 15 — can show you when your Amazon packages are arriving. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LMh1CW"&gt;Echo smart speakers and smart displays have a handy feature that can show and tell you when there’s a package sitting on your doorstep and even what’s in it. While this can be helpful most of the time, around the holidays it could seriously ruin some surprises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jFanYE"&gt;Avoid making any Grinch-like moves this holiday and manage your Amazon shopping notifications in the Alexa app to help keep the magic alive. Alongside options for tailoring package announcements, the notifications section of the app also has a number of settings you can toggle on or off to help make the voice assistant a little more helpful when it comes to purchases you make on Amazon. Below are a few of the most useful that you might want to tweak this holiday season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngcWqw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to turn off package notifications on Alexa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZZRnVV"&gt;Open the Alexa app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hiDvS7"&gt;Tap on More in the bottom right hand corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J12seb"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Notifications &amp;gt; Amazon Shopping.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BOfjaT"&gt;Under “Say or Show Item Titles” toggle off “including items in your shopping cart marked as gifts, or those that might be gifts during major holidays.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fhRDDkyJbnHjBxhJN9UdJWG2jHM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23079984/alexa_notifications_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshots by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One you are in the Amazon Shopping Notifications page of the Alexa app (far right) you can toggle on and off the different notifications you want to receive on your Echo speakers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJVuZ"&gt;Once this is done, you will still get announcements on Echo speakers and on-screen notifications on Echo smart displays for your packages, but those you tagged as gifts in your shopping cart (or that Alexa suspects may be) won’t include a description of what they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOoDCU"&gt;This is handy if you actually do want the household to know there’s toilet paper on your doorstep, but not that the Nintendo Switch arrived. To ensure this works correctly, check “send as a gift” when the item is in your Amazon cart.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpiGNQ"&gt;To be on the safe side, you can toggle off all the items under “Say or Show Item Titles.” Then you will just get word when a package is out for delivery or delivered but never what it is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p55shU"&gt;If you don’t want any package notifications from Alexa — anywhere, any way — and want to be surprised when you open the door toggle off all items on this screen. (Note — these settings only affect announcements on Echo speakers, you will still get any push, email or other notifications you’ve signed up for.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F0tuB8"&gt;How to stop Alexa asking you to rate purchases&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmEETRXVZETmcqhLjI3hpFwR6DU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23080013/IMG_AB2E3A792741_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Further down that same Amazon Shopping page are more options for asking the voice assistant to stay quiet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5XCip6"&gt;While you’re here, if you’ve been getting annoyed by Alexa’s pestering you to rate that cheese grater you bought two months ago (this happened to me at 9:30PM when I asked Alexa to read my Audible book), there is a quick fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Wf3Xa"&gt;Scroll a bit further down on the same Shopping Notifications page and toggle off “Request to rate products you’ve purchased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQYMUc"&gt;You can also stop Alexa from announcing the latest deal on the laundry detergent you usually purchase by toggling off “Recommendations and Deals.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtX3qq"&gt;There are other options in here you might want to check out if you often find your Alexa speaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22747275/amazon-echo-speaker-alexa-flashing-green-red-orange-yellow"&gt;flashing yellow&lt;/a&gt; — like it’s trying to get your attention (which it is). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7Z26i"&gt;If you use Amazon’s Subscribe &amp;amp; Save program Alexa can audibly notify you if an item in your upcoming delivery is out of stock, among other things. You can toggle this option on or off under Order Updates, this will affect announcements about any order updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjb4Bs"&gt;You can use this screen to stop Alexa from randomly offering up “personalized recommendations and deals” on your speakers, as well as turn off voice-assistant updates about your Audible account (such as if you have a new credit).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsVprC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqcAVz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Install the Microsoft Teams update for Android now to fix 911 calling bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Microsoft Teams logo is seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MWoMDtAzeeZMCo_5WGKcJTvffnA=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261417/1208744069.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hnKDTL"&gt;Microsoft Teams has rolled out a fix for the dangerous bug that could prevent Android users from calling 911 — and you’ll want to install it ASAP (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/microsoft-teams-android-911-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828234/microsoft-teams-android-bug-blocked-911-call-go-read-this"&gt;his analysis of the issue&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mmrahman123/how-a-bug-in-android-and-microsoft-teams-could-have-caused-this-users-911-call-to-fail-6525f9ba5e63"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medium&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mishaal Rahman, the senior technical editor at &lt;em&gt;Esper&lt;/em&gt;, explains that Microsoft has corrected the issue in an update for the Teams app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yjShAN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you didn’t end up uninstalling Teams, make sure to update it as soon as you can&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbJrrm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;A user on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; initially discovered the bug when trying to call 911 from their Pixel 3, prompting an explanation from Google. The company said that the issue is triggered by an “unintended interaction” between the Android operating system and the Teams app. It only affects users with devices running Android 10 or later, and who have the Teams app installed but aren’t signed in. However, Google still advised all users with Android 10 or above to uninstall Teams anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="La9lS6"&gt;But if you didn’t end up uninstalling Teams, make sure to update it as soon as you can. Rahman notes that version 1416/1.0.0.2021194504 resolves the issue, which he found was building duplicate instances of the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/telecom/PhoneAccount"&gt;PhoneAccount class&lt;/a&gt; in the Android operating system, a function that lets apps place and receive phone calls. That said, many Android apps that have a calling feature will create a PhoneAccount instance, but in the case of Teams, it was creating too many when the user accessed the app while not signed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztraYA"&gt;Rahman notes that the updated version doesn’t create duplicate PhoneAccount instances, and will also clear any previously-built PhoneAccount instances when launched. Google also plans on issuing an update to Android on January 4th, so hopefully, that will help fix anything that went wrong on its own end. You can install the updated version of Microsoft Teams from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.teams"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DraftKings signs up real NFL players to use in ‘gamified NFT collections’ next season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New England Patriots Practice" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3SFudhIhnVVVpBBAMt0RYrHVho=/0x0:2269x1513/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70261310/1229235990.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New England Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore (24) stretches during the New England Patriots practice session in Foxborough, MA on Oct. 22, 2020.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ue9BF9"&gt;You only have to look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822410/ubisoft-nfts-quartz-digits-ghost-recon-breakpoint"&gt;at the negative response to Ubisoft’s NFT gaming announcement&lt;/a&gt; and the number of people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;chortling along with Keanu Reeves&lt;/a&gt; to confirm that reactions to non-fungible tokens range from disbelief to outright dislike. However, that hasn’t stopped DraftKings and the NFL Player’s Association from signing a new deal for a “gamified NFT collaboration.” The sports betting company plans to launch its collections during the 2022 - 2023 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOiLO2"&gt;As far as how the operation will work, the details are scarce. The press release describes a combination that sounds similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt; / NFL All Day model with buying and trading, plus the ability for registered owners of NFTs to use their collectibles like many trading card-based games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k7Csc4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Valve bans blockchain games and NFTs on Steam, Epic will try to make it work","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728425/valve-steam-blockchain-nft-crypto-ban-games-age-of-rust"},{"title":"Keanu Reeves can’t stop laughing at the idea of NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LbyXHn"&gt;Initial anticipated features of DraftKings’ gamified NFL player NFTs include the ability for customers to use these collectibles within games against others on the platform as well as separate buying and selling functionality. It is expected there will be a variety of NFT editions and tiers that incorporate different aspects of utility and digital scarcity, all powered by Polygon. DraftKings previously announced a strategic agreement with Polygon to provide a scalable, eco-friendly blockchain solution that enables added throughput, lower transaction fees and expanded capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wDqkee"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQJcC4"&gt;One advantage this has over most of the NFT collaborations is that it will operate in a world where money is already the focus, so it seems unlikely that DraftKings gamblers will find the mere suggestion distasteful. Gauging the risks of wild speculation or gambling on seemingly meaningless items is what people are already there for anyway. There’s a strange parallel to the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/3/9090191/mtgox-mark-karpeles-bitcoin-arrested-cryptocurrency"&gt; rise (and eventual fall) of the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox&lt;/a&gt;, which started as a website for trading &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering Online&lt;/em&gt; cards like stocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3SlbS"&gt;NFL teams are already trying to find a future in NFTs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789265/nft-nfl-football-commerative-ticketmaster"&gt;attaching them to tickets for select games&lt;/a&gt; and through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22801332/nfl-all-day-nft-sports-top-shot-collectible-dapper-labs"&gt;Dapper Labs-built NFL All Day marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. NFL All Day launched its closed beta on Thursday and has already had to warn members about scammers and bots trying to fleece them for its “Moments” highlights, even though features like minting, buying, and trading, aren’t supported yet. As for the union representing players, this deal for name, image, and likeness rights is just another way to get in the mix of “the emerging landscape of digital entertainment that creates excitement among players and fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v3hGs"&gt;All three DraftKings founders appear to be sporting Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars (I assume, I have not verified their ownership on the blockchain) on Twitter, so clearly, there is a focus on this as a potential market. Co-founder Jason Robins &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonDRobins/status/1466189374350053376"&gt;tweeted on December 1st&lt;/a&gt; that “The money we are making in crypto is peanuts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sEDWnn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The only reason &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattkalish?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mattkalish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaulLiberman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@PaulLiberman&lt;/a&gt;, and me spend any time on this is to learn.  The money we are making in crypto is peanuts (though the return percentages are incredible).  The founders learning blockchain deeply is all in service of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DKNG&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$DKNG&lt;/a&gt; shareholders (including us!)&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Robins (@JasonDRobins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JasonDRobins/status/1466189374350053376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ph9UUR"&gt;In a press release announcing this deal, the senior vice president of product operations for DraftKings Marketplace, Beth Beiriger, said, “few organizations beyond DraftKings are as equipped to capitalize on the increasing intersection between sports and NFTs that will be cornerstones of engagement and entertainment within Web3.” In a statement given to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marieschulte-bockum/2021/12/08/draftkings-signs-deal-with-nfl-players-association-as-old-guard-gaming-companies-jump-aboard-nft-hype-train/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Bieriger continued, saying, “We’re a tech company. This partnership with the NFLPA will allow us to bring incredible IP into this new emerging technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oF3pRq"&gt;The company also has a strong incentive to seek out new markets or new ways to capitalize on its current base. Despite surviving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12373786/draftkings-fanduel-legal-new-york-state"&gt;some attempts to ban its daily fantasy operations&lt;/a&gt; a few years ago, some speculators doubt its business model and long-term prospects. One short-seller &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2021%2F12%2F03%2Fwhy-draftkings-stock-plunged-today%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F12%2F22829795%2Fnft-game-gambling-draftkings-nflpa-polygon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;called it “massively overvalued” last week&lt;/a&gt; due to spending big on marketing to fuel its growth. DraftKings’ stock currently trades at around $30, which is less than half of the $74 peak it reached in March as the three founders pledged to take a base salary of $1 for 2021 (&lt;a href="https://draftkings.gcs-web.com/static-files/75297a17-de31-4e0f-ab0c-d3c469d9b844"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5gOb8"&gt;There’s no word yet on when we can expect details on the actual game, although the collections will live on DraftKings’ marketplace. Some NFT gaming projects exist, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22725083/axie-infinity-sky-mavis-blockchain-economy-game-pokemon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; however, a significant proportion of its player base consists of previously unbanked people in the Philippines. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22822590/sports-betting-streaming-wars-disney-dazn-fubo-tv-sling"&gt;when even Disney-owned ESPN is looking for a way into sports betting&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not surprising that online bookmakers are taking a chance on NFTs in an attempt to be the first in a new area.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite is getting four new playlists on December 14th — including Slayer</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wud1bO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;is getting Slayer, Free-For-All (FFA), Tactical Slayer (SWAT), and Fiesta playlists, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/re5kdv/playlist_update/"&gt;Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from u/ske7ch343, otherwise known as 343 Industries’ community director Brian Jarrard (via &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/halo-infinite-getting-new-playlists-dec-14"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Jarrard confirmed that the four playlists are coming to the game via an update on December 14th.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Halo Infinite MP is getting four new playlists on December 14th: Slayer, Fiesta, FFA, and Tactical Slayer (SWAT)   &lt;a href="https://t.co/DeTJQEz5zy"&gt;https://t.co/DeTJQEz5zy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/hzTLFGA2De"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hzTLFGA2De&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1469748946906099715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKfwjO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816491/halo-infinite-multiplayer-deathmatch-slayer-dedicated-playlist"&gt;343 Industries previously&lt;/a&gt; said that Fiesta, SWAT, and FFA playlists would be coming to the game by the end of the year, while a Social Slayer playlist wouldn’t arrive until sometime in 2022. In his post, Jarrard acknowledges that developers promised a Social Slayer playlist with “a variety of new variants.” But since this wouldn’t get done before the holidays, 343 has decided to launch a basic Slayer playlist first, and will “look to bolster and expand with more variants” in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8nkmo"&gt;Currently, you can’t choose your game mode. You’re forced to rotate between Capture The Flag (CTF), Slayer, Strongholds, and Oddball, which is obviously a pain if you prefer playing one game type. It’s also an annoyance if you’re tasked with completing a challenge that corresponds to a specific mode, however, 343 is addressing that complaint as well — Jarrard says that the December 14th update will remove “particularly frustrating” mode-specific challenges as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dFoFpn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The update will remove “particularly frustrating” mode-specific challenges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pc04Sr"&gt;The update will also lessen some requirements for challenges, make the weekly ultimate challenge “less intensive,” and will add challenges specifically for the upcoming playlists. 343 is also slowly trying to implement performance-based XP — something that the game currently doesn’t offer — by adding a challenge category that’s “based on accumulating player score.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrsKaT"&gt;Right now, you’re only rewarded with XP for completing challenges, not for each game you play, which has been a major complaint among players who want to level up. Last month, 343 attempted to address battle pass progression issues by adding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788990/halo-infinite-battle-pass-progression-xp-changes"&gt;a “Play 1 Game” challenge&lt;/a&gt;, increasing the duration of XP boosts, and rewarding players with more XP for the first six matches they play in a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNZlh5"&gt;In addition to these changes, Jarrard also noted that developers are working on fixing the “intermittent hiccups” that seem to affect Big Team Battle (BTB), and is also taking a look at ranked matchmaking after hearing reports of “potential anomalies.” Although &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was officially released on December 8th, players are still waiting for the co-op story mode that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791487/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-season-2-may-2022-forge"&gt;set to become available in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a way to replay individual levels in the campaign, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22821522/halo-infinite-campaign-levels-replay-mission-select-343-industries-microsoft"&gt;which 343 says it will add&lt;/a&gt; but doesn’t have a set timeline for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former Apple employee says she won’t withdraw her labor board complaint</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhlsXd"&gt;Former Apple employee Cher Scarlett says the company didn’t adequately live up to its half of a settlement, so she won’t withdraw her complaint to the National Labor Relations Board as agreed, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__8jy2n3rr1sb"&gt;Scarlett says that her settlement with Apple required it to post “a company-wide memo clarifying employee rights including discussing pay &amp;amp; working conditions,” “in a prominent and visible location on the People site.” She says that the company did post a notice to its site, but that it was only up during the week that Apple employees were given off for Thanksgiving. “I’d argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible,” Scarlett &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032"&gt;tweeted on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iyTsr3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite the fact that there was no requirement for a time period, the agreement clearly stated "in a prominent and visible location on the People site".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'd argue all day that 7 days while no one is online for a holiday is absolutely not prominent and visible.&lt;/p&gt;— Cher Scarlett (@cherthedev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cherthedev/status/1469027299353772032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f6ksV6"&gt;The&lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/facilitate-settlements"&gt;NLRB says&lt;/a&gt;it can reject a withdrawal request made because of a private settlement if it “violates the National Labor Relations Act or Board policy.” Scarlett told&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the board initially rejected her request, and sent a list of 22 changes that the board would need Apple to make before it would approve the withdrawal. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/angelauyeung/2021/12/09/ex-apple-engineer-cher-scarlett-reinstates-us-labor-agency-complaint-against-apple/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the requested changes removed wording that would’ve prevented Scarlett from encouraging someone “to file any charge or complaint with any administrative agency or Court against Apple” for a year. According to Scarlett, Apple refused to make those changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7x6pQ"&gt;“I technically could ask for a unilateral withdrawal at this point,” Scarlett said in a message to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that she had been “interested in doing that to avoid witnesses having to give testimony, because realistically the memo is the best outcome we would have gotten from the board.” According to Scarlett, the group of potential witnesses decided it was worth it to continue with the complaint, potentially risking retaliation for testifying, given how Apple handled posting the memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2pYYC"&gt;Scarlett &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22788245/cher-scarlett-apple-nlrb-settlement-leaves-company-appletoo-pay-equity"&gt;left the company in November&lt;/a&gt;, after filing the complaint that accused the company of engaging “in coercive and suppressive activity that has enabled abuse and harassment of organizers of protected concerted activity.” While at the company, she worked to let employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22609687/apple-pay-equity-employee-surveys-protected-activity"&gt;discuss and gather data about pay equity&lt;/a&gt; and was part of #AppleToo, a campaign about the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;failure to deal with harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Web Services says overwhelmed network devices triggered outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uqgUjc1kUcmcoTmhO-r-Eq2lEGU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70259492/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MBDHrO"&gt;Amazon Web Services (AWS) has provided an explanation as to what caused the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;outage that downed parts of its own services&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the third-party websites and online platforms that utilize AWS. In a post on the &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/message/12721/"&gt;AWS website&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that an automated process caused the outage, which began around 10:30AM ET in the Northern Virginia (US-EAST-1) region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WUFUsi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The spike in congestion prevented the company’s operations team from using its real-time monitoring system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YJFiWb"&gt;“An automated activity to scale capacity of one of the AWS services hosted in the main AWS network triggered an unexpected behavior from a large number of clients inside the internal network,” Amazon’s report says. “This resulted in a large surge of connection activity that overwhelmed the networking devices between the internal network and the main AWS network, resulting in delays for communication between these networks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VgMnuY"&gt;According to the report, this issue even impacted Amazon’s ability to see what exactly was going wrong with the system. It prevented the company’s operations team from using the real-time monitoring system and internal controls that they typically rely on, explaining why the outage took so long to fix. Amazon notes that service started didn’t start improving until 4:34PM ET, and the issue was fully resolved at 5:22PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqxxFB"&gt;Since Amazon’s Support Contact Center also runs on the AWS network, customers weren’t able to create support cases for seven hours during the outage. &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;Amazon’s Service Health&lt;/a&gt; dashboard, which the platform uses to provide status updates, was also impacted, resulting in Amazon’s delayed acknowledgment of the issue. The company says that it’s working on a way to improve its response to outages, and plans on releasing a revamped version of the Service Health Dashboard that should help customers across receive timely updates if an outage occurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDCpHa"&gt;In addition to knocking out popular services, like Venmo, Tinder, Disney Plus, and even Roomba, the December 7th outage also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822736/amazon-delivery-van-atoz-app-warehouse-outage-aws"&gt;put some Amazon deliveries on hold&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon experienced its last major outage around this time last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;causing a number of sites and apps to go down&lt;/a&gt; for hours.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter could bring universal casting that actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSjLQu7b-61QZ8vRbvaiJ56pc5g=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249408/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This Amazon-led casting standard for TVs could challenge Apple AirPlay and Google Cast &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eU6aaf"&gt;The new smart home standard Matter is making a lot of grand promises, chief among them are fixing the interoperability mess the smart home is currently in and making Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon talk to each other. Big jobs. But it’s also tackling one of the other pain points in the connected home: TV control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm1PBy"&gt;One part of the new connectivity protocol is a specification for televisions and streaming video players. This means that Matter could become yet another way to control content in our homes. But, with its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter’s TV spec has the potential to replace proprietary casting systems, like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Cast, and finally free our TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2niZc"&gt;Matter TV, as we’ll call it for wont of an official name, will allow control of a television’s core functions — volume up / down, changing the channel, controlling inputs and outputs, and switching between HDMI ports. “But importantly, you can also do casting,” Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oENWS1"&gt;“This is an area with at least five proprietary protocols today,” he says. “The result is a complete opportunity loss for everyone.” Not to mention major headaches for users as they grapple with which voice assistant can get this content and which remote will control that streaming stick. Amazon is leading the effort to define the specification for Matter — unsurprising, as it is currently the only large player without a proprietary way to cast content from a smartphone to a TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sv-CBjF74efHYHqQaY3CTpNuA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13262367/jbareham_180726_2773_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controlling our smart TVs can feel anything but smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1AsPEc"&gt;“Control of media is one of the most popular use cases for Alexa,” says DeCenzo, who told me Amazon is working with the different industry leaders in the fields of smart TVs, streaming video players, and content providers to help them adopt Matter. The goal is so that “customers can have a consistent way to use voice control and to launch their favorite content on those screens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0NyUx"&gt;While the Matter TV specification doesn’t explicitly call out voice control, the idea here is standardization. One protocol for all device communication, everything will talk to everything else using the same language, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made it. Ultimately, this means you will be able to use your control interface of choice (a voice assistant, remote control, or smartphone / tablet app) with all your streaming content devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7HxJWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter could finally free our TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rguZA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;When Matter arrives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the Matter TV specification will use app-to-app communication, at least until the TVs and streaming video players become Matter enabled. The spec supports casting from a Matter client (e.g., a remote, a smart speaker, or a phone app) to an app running on a Matter-enabled TV or video player device, explains DeCenzo. It also supports URL-based casting, which means a Matter client can cast to a TV even when there’s no app for that client, if the TV supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH, an international standard for streaming) or HLS DRM streams (HLS is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple and widely supported across Android devices and browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tus8PG"&gt;The capability could go beyond just entertainment and be used to enable smart home notifications, says Chris LaPré of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that oversees the new standard. For example, it could cast a message from your connected doorbell to your smart TV, notifying you that someone is at the door. It could potentially show you the video feed, too, something of a workaround for including video feeds in Matter, since cameras are not part of the first device rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ietivWcwo5KkGDZsTA4bL1fY9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074285/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA / Matter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter-enabled devices will have the Matter logo on them to indicate they’re compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="to2vl9"&gt;Intriguingly, LaPré posited that the specification could allow for the use of context when delivering these messages, such as notifying you from the smart speaker in the room you are in that your laundry is done. “It can be about casting anything, smart home notifications, local video — all it needs is a URL to pull content from,” says LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hntmBy"&gt;The technology here is not system-level specific, as with Apple’s AirPlay. It appears to be more akin to Google’s Cast, where apps will need to build support for it, at least initially. But like AirPlay, and as with all Matter communications, it’s entirely local. Communication from device to device uses Matter as the channel. At launch, Matter will use ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread as its communication protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s30Vfu"&gt;The requirement for the app makers — such as Hulu and Netflix, who aren’t currently members of the CSA — to build Matter support could make this something of a non-starter initially. Beyond Amazon and its Prime Video and Google with YouTube, few of the major streaming content providers are part of the CSA, and the app developer will initially need to add Matter support to both the app in the phone or casting device (for example, a smart speaker, laptop, or smartphone) and the app in the receiving device (TV, streaming stick, smart display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCw2XM"&gt;“You can have communication directly from the Prime Video app on my phone to the Prime Video app that’s on the TV,” explains DeCenzo. Going forward, according to LaPré, the streaming video players and TVs will have Matter built into the devices themselves, and at this point the apps in the receiving device won’t need to be Matter-enabled. It seems likely Amazon will enable Matter on its Fire TV devices, and the company has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;committed to upgrading all its smart speakers to support Matter&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung, TCL, Panasonic, Toshiba, and LG are all involved with Matter, as are Apple and Google. Also, streaming video player maker Roku is part of the Matter TV working group. However, according to the list of companies on the &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;Matter website&lt;/a&gt;, Vizio and Sony are two notable hardware players that are not yet signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JleYxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a consistent way to use voice control to launch content on any screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcAKqp"&gt;The main goal, however, is part of Matter’s overarching promise: avoiding manufacturer lock-in. People should be able to buy whichever device they choose and it should be able to talk to all the other connected devices in their home, regardless of who made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqOY9"&gt;For example, if both were Matter-enabled you should be able to control an LG TV from a Samsung smartphone, and that LG TV should be able to receive a message from a Miele smart washer that the laundry is done. But, and this is a big but, nothing in the overall Matter spec is a requirement. A company that is on board with Matter as a whole is under no obligation to adopt a certain device specification that they don’t need or want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEcMbI"&gt;This means that Apple and Google do not have to adopt the Matter TV specification if they don’t want to (but if they do, they have to adopt it all, including casting). LaPré says both companies have “blessed this” as part of the spec (Matter is governed by members of the CSA who vote on the specifications). Whether they will adopt it remains to be seen. But if Amazon does, which seems like a good bet, it should mean you can use Matter to cast from your Amazon Prime app on your iPhone to your Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1CPHb"&gt;I reached out to both Google and Apple about this specification and how it would impact their current offerings. Both companies have committed to supporting Matter in their respective smart home ecosystems and both are members of the CSA. Kevin Po of Google said in an email that “Google Assistant will support Matter (eg. on/off, play/pause, app launch etc.) at parity with our current Works With Assistant offering.” Apple did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5nr5N9"&gt;Po went on to reiterate that Google Cast remains Google’s preferred method for sending media via apps and voice to Chromecasts, speakers, and displays. As, we can only assume at this stage, will Airplay be Apple’s “preferred method.” But what your preferred method will be could very soon involve a lot more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKv5qW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Thursday, December 9th, 1:20PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that if a company chooses to adopt the Matter TV spec, it will need to adopt all of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34SCdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Saturday, December 11th, 2:45PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;A previous version of this article stated that according to the list of companies on the Matter website, Roku and Toshiba were not part of Matter. The CSA reached out to say its website is out of date and Toshiba and Roku are now members. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s app tracking transparency feature isn’t an instant privacy button</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ByQJj0"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/69396795-f6e1-4624-95d8-121e4e5d7839"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; acts as a reminder of what Apple’s App Tracking Transparency settings do and do not do to protect your privacy (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/apple-reaches-quiet-truce-over-iphone-privacy-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While asking apps to not track you does keep them from collecting and selling data tied to your personal advertising identity, it doesn’t keep developers from collecting any information about you at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AAawK0"&gt;The feature, introduced in iOS 14.5, is meant to prevent app-makers from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;tracking what you do and selling that information to advertisers&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22415824/facebook-instagram-notice-ios-apps-free-privacy-tracking"&gt;cried foul when it was introduced&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it would hurt their ability to show targeted, personalized ads, and therefore hurt businesses that relied on those ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k1GJHu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Apple’s new privacy feature is such a big deal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9G2ObX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Companies have turned to aggregated and anonymized data, which still comes from individuals&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WDIM97"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, though, developers have taken Apple’s rules to mean that they’re allowed to target ads at cohorts, or groups that people are put into without needing to have unique IDs assigned. The report says that developers like Snap, Inc. have continued collecting some data, including from those who have asked them not to track them, with the justification that anything that could be tied to an individual user would be anonymized and grouped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfnW4L"&gt;It’s a similar concept to FLoC, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google’s plan for a post-third-party cookie internet&lt;/a&gt;, where individuals are assigned labels describing what kind of things they might buy instead of being tracked individually. Ads can still be targeted, without advertisers having to keep track of everything everyone does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6RCvaE"&gt;Some developers &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/10/more-details-emerge-on-how-snap-facebook-and-others-are-skirting-app-tracking-transparency/"&gt;have admitted&lt;/a&gt;, though, that they also try to make predictions about what users do after seeing ads based on info they receive from ad companies. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times &lt;/em&gt;also says that some personalized data, like IP address, location, and screen size, still makes its way to advertisers, to help ensure that ads fit properly and show up in the right language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFJlqH"&gt;According to the report, Facebook and many other companies are planning on selling ads using aggregated or anonymized data. While Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;partially blamed Apple’s policies&lt;/a&gt; for it missing its earnings goals last quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;it’s estimated&lt;/a&gt; that the ads affected by the rules only made up 5 percent of its annual ad revenue. In other words, Apple’s ad tracking permissions were never going to destroy Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77cmgb"&gt;None of this is to say that there are no privacy benefits to hitting the “Ask app not to track” button — a previous &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; investigation found that Snap, Inc, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;lost $10 billion combined after the feature was implemented&lt;/a&gt;, so there was obviously a market for ads driven by that data. But it’s good to remember that even Apple, a company that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;prides itself on “standing up” for its users&lt;/a&gt;, can’t stop companies from collecting your data with a single switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Multiple deaths confirmed after tornado hits Amazon warehouse</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GjXXNX"&gt;An Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois collapsed following a bout of severe weather and tornados that ripped across the Midwest and South on Friday night. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/injuries-reported-after-roof-collapse-amazon-warehouse-illinois-ap-2021-12-11/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, at least two deaths have been confirmed, and a number of workers are still unaccounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lV7Daf"&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.com/collinsvilleEMA/posts/269327955226516"&gt;A post&lt;/a&gt; on Illinois’ Collinsville Emergency Management Agency’s Facebook page called the collapse a “mass casualty” incident. It &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=269627795196532&amp;amp;set=a.222212819938030"&gt;later posted&lt;/a&gt; an update with a photo of the event’s aftermath, showing a large portion of the warehouse completely torn away by the storm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W83334"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Workers killed in Amazon warehouse collapse following severe weather in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/edwardsville?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#edwardsville&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/stlwx?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#stlwx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/tornado?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#tornado&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q9HTdgEJFa"&gt;https://t.co/q9HTdgEJFa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FOX2now (@FOX2now) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FOX2now/status/1469634191616884739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wNxM"&gt;During a press conference this morning, police chief Mike Fillback told reporters that authorities have had trouble finding out “how many people we actually had at that facility at the time because it’s not a set staff.” Amazon management was at the scene to help create a list of staff members who are accounted for, however, Fillback notes that it’s still difficult to determine how many people remain trapped inside the collapsed building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ0gxx"&gt;Around 30 people reportedly made it out of the facility safely. While some were transported by bus to a safe area and reunited with family, others were able to leave the scene on their own (via &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/least-one-person-dead-severe-weather-event-illinois-amazon-warehouse-rcna8464"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). It remains unclear how many people were originally in the building, but Fillback estimates it might’ve been around 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcgDJ3"&gt;“The safety and well-being of our employees and partners is our top priority right now,” Amazon spokesperson Richard Rocha said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re assessing the situation and will share additional information when it’s available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qo8WF"&gt;Illinois wasn’t the only state affected by the severe storms. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 70 fatalities are expected in Kentucky, while one was killed after a possible tornado hit a nursing home in Arkansas. President Joe Biden sent out a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1469683523447664642"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; this morning, stating that the administration is “working with Governors to ensure they have what they need as the search for survivors and damage assessments continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
