    <title>Apple will replace these MacBook Pro batteries for free if they don’t charge past one percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYJ6M8zb7G-HS7NcdAjrOQH9BF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795963/vpavic_161031_1256_0264.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Gf2uC"&gt;Apple has launched &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212163"&gt;a new, free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros that won’t charge past one percent. The issue affects “a very small number of customers,” according to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubATdu"&gt;If your battery is affected, you’ll see a “Service Recommended” message when checking the battery health status. “If the status indicates that your battery is Normal, your battery is not affected by this issue,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYZEOP"&gt;To get the battery replacement started, &lt;a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=kbase&amp;amp;PFC=PFC1002&amp;amp;category_id=SC0999&amp;amp;symptom_id=21085"&gt;contact Apple support&lt;/a&gt;. The company will examine your Mac prior to servicing it to “verify that it is eligible for the free battery replacement,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FwcV1"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, Apple released &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;macOS Big Sur 11.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, which is also intended to help fix charging issues with some 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros. Apple recommends updating your computer to that or the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 supplemental update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66I8GP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s new tiny double-sided wireless charger can top up your Apple Watch or AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3I9VG6bzyFFftIUQ3vvIaABic8I=/0x807:2500x2474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795913/2021_02_09_IMG3_rev1009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tFqHHt"&gt;Satechi has launched a double-sided charger that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch or AirPods — but not both at once — while hopefully saving you from the added clutter of extra cables. The Satechi USB-C Watch AirPods Charger features a Qi charging pad shaped like an AirPods Pro charging case on one side, and a charging “puck” for an Apple Watch on the other. The charger is available now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHP862ZM%2FA%2Fsatechi-usb-c-watch-airpods-charger%3Ffnode%3D6f80832709d8a1d4e23e62afc26e6bd967efaf3d026095ef053ef6420d01ba33e0519f86e06da9aae95ef04cdf8b699eb8cff6341b085f4e575fb9594093b692592d28f0091b18020b14c4e610d9eff984ab0c7d7d461aa297c93d0f5530363c70c9b854cdecbca8c4c8def9a47e39bf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F2%2F9%2F22275296%2Fsatechi-double-sided-wireless-charger-apple-watch-airpods#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusively from Apple for $49.95&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYvOCn"&gt;Satechi’s new charger has an aluminum build, white finish, and a small charging indicator light that fits right in with Apple’s minimalist product design. Because of the reversible nature of USB-C, switching between Apple Watch and AirPods charging only requires pulling the charger out, flipping it over, and plugging it back in. It can’t charge both your Watch and AirPods at the same time like some other charging stands or pads, but hopefully the compact size is worth the cost of that added convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqgCCW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-McZg5c9xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVPC2W"&gt;Having a charger jutting out of your laptop or tablet of course has its own risks — I’d definitely worry about situations where it might snap off. Then again, Apple’s guilty of designing its own ridiculous charging set-ups, like it did with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9295901/apple-ipad-stylus-pen-announced-price-specs-date"&gt;the original Apple Pencil&lt;/a&gt;. Satechi’s not that extreme, and it definitely seems convenient.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Jack Dorsey wants to build an app store for social media algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiJ9cdau4lD_sBRsmte2Pz0DaH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795784/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vVEbFg"&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey imagines a future where you get to choose what you see on social media by picking out your favorite recommendation algorithm, rather than relying on a single controlling company to get it exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xjsns"&gt;On a call with investors today, Dorsey expanded on his vision of how a decentralized social network might work — and why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;Twitter would want to create a network&lt;/a&gt; that’s beyond the control of itself or any other company. Dorsey said Twitter would benefit by having access to “a much larger corpus of conversation” from which it can surface relevant content to users. “That’s where we will be competitive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3UjSCr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is something that not only we can host but we can participate in.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9iBmv"&gt;Dorsey said Twitter is “excited to build” features that will give people more choice over what they see. “You can imagine an app-store-like view of ranking algorithms that give people ultimate flexibility in terms of” what posts are put in front of them, Dorsey said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRHlN4"&gt;Twitter could both create its own ranking algorithms for people to choose from and offer a “marketplace” where people select different options. “That is something that not only we can host but we can participate in,” he said. Giving people more choice would “not only help out business, but drive more people into participating in social media in the first place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THHaYr"&gt;Dorsey also sees decentralization as a way to “address some of the problems” around Section 230, the law that gives platforms protection from user-created content. The law has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;recently been a popular target&lt;/a&gt; for some legislators, and a decentralized network might offer Twitter a way to avoid issues if stricter rules were to be put in place, whether those rules require more moderation or for Twitter to apply a more neutral approach to what content is surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vdjWRW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Section 230 is 25 years old, and it’s never been more important","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0S5cdQ"&gt;Twitter has slowly been working on developing a decentralized social network for more than a year. Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt;, named Bluesky, in December 2019, but the company is just now trying to hire a project manager — so things are clearly a ways off. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;published a deep dive&lt;/a&gt; last month on where the project is headed, and it described Bluesky as “firmly in the research phase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v3rU0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"&gt;Decentralized social networks exist already&lt;/a&gt;, though none have had great success (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15177856/mastodon-social-network-twitter-clone"&gt;remember Mastodon?&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter said the Bluesky team may choose to work with an existing decentralized system, or they may end up building a new one if the team thinks that’s the best approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will let Super Healthy Kids have a pear (shaped logo) after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1BEjI290elSYonW22XoKK2-vuCw=/159x0:1841x1121/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795553/prepear_apple.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Prepear logo, compared to Apple’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OovfCc"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360683/apple-super-healthy-kids-prepear-pear-logo"&gt;the routine story of a trademark opposition&lt;/a&gt; captured the world’s imagination, when Apple declared that Super Healthy Kids (yes, that’s the real name of a company) shouldn’t be allowed to trademark its pear logo because it might “cause dilution of the distinctiveness” of Apple’s own famous fruit-shaped intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95IjAz"&gt;Six months later, the case is now settled, and it seems Apple didn’t actually have a pear-shaped problem after all — because Super Healthy Kids has agreed to change the shape of the &lt;em&gt;leaf &lt;/em&gt;atop that pear, and Apple has agreed that’s good enough to let the trademark go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Prepear’s new logo has a half-moon shaped leaf, instead of the pointed oval." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnS6ctgpIW5BGPdlEgIC1hh0KDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293470/prepear_logo_change.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;USPTO&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prepear’s new logo has a half-moon shaped leaf, instead of the pointed oval.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kJpCoe"&gt;Apple has already consented to the settlement, according to documents &lt;a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91254886&amp;amp;pty=OPP"&gt;filed at the USPTO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53JGbX"&gt;“Prepear is pleased to announce that it has amicably resolved its trademark issue with Apple,” company co-founder Russ Monson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that it plans to change its app logo in the coming weeks. The app’s website already features the new leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PI6Xzqy7RB_zS-LqaRgOUY4J-wo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293434/Prepear_Logo_Old_vs_New_2021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="seeBFq"&gt;Monson’s &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/apple-save-the-pear-from-apple-end-apple-s-aggressive-opposition-of-small-businesses-with-fruit-logos/sign#:~:text=End%20Apple's%20Aggressive%20Opposition%20of%20Businesses%20with%20Fruit%20Logos&amp;amp;text=Apple%20has%20been%20opposing%20small,business%20as%20Apple%20at%20all."&gt;“Save the Pear from Apple!” petition at Change.org&lt;/a&gt; wound up getting 269,650 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nza0XE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai is getting serious about building a ‘walking car’ with four legs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UdV3NkgLQkC2FjiQ4GOXyMSUxYk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795491/006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hyundai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYZV8A"&gt;Who needs an Apple car when you’ve got one with four legs? Hyundai, which recently acquired a controlling stake in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;robot maker Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, rolled out a new version of its four-legged “walking car” concept that it first unveiled in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyRwk6"&gt;Hyundai is calling it TIGER, which stands for “Transforming Intelligent Ground Excursion Robot.” It’s the second vehicle to come out of the automaker’s Ultimate Mobility Vehicles studio in Silicon Valley, and the first designed to be fully autonomous, with no space for drivers or passengers. It’s like a real-life Transformer, but without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w6jLPX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s like a real-life Transformer, just without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FYDGQ1"&gt;In fact, Hyundai actually thinks its four-legged vehicles have the potential to make the world a better place. The vehicles are designed specifically to access remote locations for missions related to scientific exploration, or to deliver food or medical supplies during a natural disaster or other emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l6cjtJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10332575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="siSTZZ"&gt;But how does it work? TIGER has four “legs,” each with a series of joints, enabling the vehicle to mimic both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits. According to Hyundai:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAoCxN"&gt;Based on a modular platform architecture, its features include a sophisticated leg and wheel locomotion system, 360-degree directional control, and a range of sensors for remote observation. It is also intended to connect to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can fully charge and deliver TIGER to inaccessible locations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDnx8x"&gt;With its legs retracted, TIGER drives like an all-wheel drive vehicle and is in its most efficient mode because it moves by rolling traction. But when the vehicle gets stuck or needs to travel over terrain that is difficult or impassable for wheels alone, it uses its walking ability to get unstuck or more easily travel over that terrain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y5Qen"&gt;If you’re getting a strong Mars Rover vibe off this thing, that’s on purpose: Hyundai thinks the technology underpinning this vehicle could make it ripe for an interplanetary mission. The walking car can traverse uneven terrain, climb a wall, step over a gap, and spread its legs to a 15-foot-wide track width — all while keeping its main cabin (and cargo) level. When not in the field, the vehicle’s legs are stowed underneath and can be driven like a normal off-roading vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWo6f0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TIGER is just a proof of concept&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UyyVcJ"&gt;But TIGER is just a proof of concept, and there’s no guarantee that Hyundai will put it into production. That said, the South Korean automaker expects “this new class of vehicles to grow rapidly over the coming years,” and is also working on other UMV concept cars for other use cases, a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHu3JC"&gt;The first four-legged concept, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173742/hyundai-walking-car-concept-elevate-ces-2019"&gt;called Elevate&lt;/a&gt;, was designed to carry passengers, while TIGER is meant to be completely uncrewed — no driver and no passengers. And while they may share some characteristics with Boston Dynamics’ robot dog, Spot, neither concept was designed with any input from the robotics firm that Hyundai recently acquired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5f0fY"&gt;Hyundai was in consideration as a manufacturing partner for Apple, which is planning on launching its own electric and autonomous vehicle. However, those talks broke down recently and Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia have sought to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;downplay rumors&lt;/a&gt; it was working with the tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsciAp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtHi0H"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s $1.5 billion bitcoin purchase clashes with its environmental aspirations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Buys USD 1.5 Billion In Bitcoin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQo7DmAvNf-45rRD8eOjvT_umE0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795435/1231048263.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla, led by Elon Musk, confirmed that it purchased about $ 1.5 billion in bitcoin in January and expects to start accepting it as a payment in the future.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdHlrz"&gt;Tesla just gave bitcoin a big boost that’s likely to result in more greenhouse gas emissions from the energy-hungry cryptocurrency. After Tesla purchased $1.5 billion in bitcoin and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will accept bitcoin as payment in the future, the price of bitcoin reached an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5mjMPz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The price of bitcoin reached an all-time high&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="feKgk6"&gt;“It’s hard to imagine, frankly a more credible endorsement than one coming from folks like Elon [Musk] who are inventing the future,” says Garrick Hileman, head of research at crypto asset company blockchain.com and visiting fellow at the London School of Economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dq8TAn"&gt;When prices are high, bitcoin “mining” — creating new coins by verifying transactions — ramps up. But even though that mining happens virtually, it results in greenhouse gas emissions that fuel a climate crisis in the real world. That’s at odds with Tesla’s mission to “accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” With its embrace of bitcoin, it’s accelerating the rise of a cryptocurrency that gobbles up energy pretty unsustainably, or at least inefficiently, &lt;em&gt;by design. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OM7zhL"&gt;Bitcoin was created to eliminate the need for a third party, like a bank, to oversee financial transactions. But without a bank’s security systems, bitcoin records are kept safe and accurate by requiring miners to solve ultra-complex numeric problems. Miners need energy-hungry machines to solve those problems, which is what drives the climate pollution associated with bitcoin. It’s a system called “proof of work” that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/7/17091766/blockchain-bitcoin-ethereum-cryptocurrency-meaning"&gt;deliberately difficult&lt;/a&gt; in order to dissuade people from trying to take over or corrupt the records. It also gets expensive to mine bitcoin because of the cost of the machines and all of the energy they guzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="grUPAw"&gt;“It should be more profitable to play by the rules than to cheat, that’s really the entire idea behind all of this,” says Michel Rauchs, a research affiliate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. “And the only way you can do that in a trustful way online is by burning electricity through those computing puzzles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="PblkVc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If bitcoin were a country, its annual electricity consumption would rank 30th in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu0ULn"&gt;If bitcoin were a country, its annual electricity consumption would rank 30th in the world. It would use just under the amount of energy Norway consumes and slightly more than Argentina, according to the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, which keeps an updated &lt;a href="https://cbeci.org/"&gt;estimate of bitcoin’s energy consumption&lt;/a&gt;. Bitcoin’s energy consumption has risen steadily since October as the &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/532811-what-is-behind-the-recent-surge-in-the-price-of-bitcoin#:~:text=Prematurely%20calling%20the%20top%20is,investors%20some%20cause%20for%20concern."&gt;price of bitcoin spiked&lt;/a&gt;. That bubble could burst, but Tesla’s bid on bitcoin has given the price of bitcoin — and its carbon dioxide emissions — an added lift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJt5RE"&gt;“I think it is concerning considering that there doesn’t seem to be an instrument to reduce the impact, other than the price,” says Susanne Köhler, a PhD fellow at Denmark’s Aalborg University who published a &lt;a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b05687"&gt;2019 paper&lt;/a&gt; on bitcoin’s environmental impact. The machines that mine bitcoin have become more efficient over time, but that hasn’t solved bitcoin’s energy problem. Because bitcoin was built on the premise of inefficiency, its puzzles are getting harder as devices get better at solving them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1BnoZ"&gt;“This is something that as long as that ‘proof of work’ mechanism isn’t changed, that situation won’t also change in the future,” says Rauchs. “The higher the bitcoin price becomes, the more profitable it is to mine. So, the more miners will want to participate in that competition and the more electricity, as total, will be burned — no matter how energy efficient the underlying equipment is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8bylN"&gt;Other cryptocurrencies have begun to move away from using “proof of work” as a sort of security system, Köhler points out. Emerging alternatives don’t drain as much energy. A model called “proof of stake,” for example, doesn’t require so many complex puzzles to validate transactions. Climate-conscious consumers might want to keep those kinds of differences in mind, whether they’re interested in cryptocurrencies or electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJnsUX"&gt;Shoppers worried about climate change might want to consider electric vehicles from other automakers, says John Quiggin, an economics professor at the University of Queensland who called Tesla’s decision “environmental vandalism” in an email. “If you’re concerned about the energy transition maybe you should be looking at General Motors, who might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;late to the party&lt;/a&gt;, but at least you can’t imagine that they’re going to go off into bitcoin,” Quiggin said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KOT7vK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s bitcoin purchase would technically inflate its carbon footprint&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o0xHsN"&gt;Tesla’s $1.5 billion purchase of bitcoin would technically inflate Tesla’s carbon footprint as a company. If considered an investment, it would be part of the company’s “&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/climateleadership/scope-3-inventory-guidance#:~:text=Scope%203%20emissions%20are%20the,impacts%20in%20its%20value%20chain.&amp;amp;text=Scope%203%20emissions%2C%20also%20referred,an%20organization's%20total%20GHG%20emissions."&gt;indirect&lt;/a&gt;” emissions. Indirect emissions also include pollution along the supply chain and from the use of its products. These indirect emissions already make up a majority of Tesla’s carbon footprint, as it does for many companies,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;according to its &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/tesla-impact-report-2019.pdf"&gt;2018 sustainability report&lt;/a&gt;. It did not release figures for its indirect emissions as a company, however, in its &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/ns_videos/2019-tesla-impact-report.pdf"&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJGIby"&gt;Figuring out the entire carbon footprint of bitcoin is even trickier. Miners are often on the move, chasing cheap electricity wherever they can get it. The source of that electricity can be hard to trace. Most bitcoin is mined in China, where it might be fueled by either dirty coal or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806772/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-energy-consumption-renewables-climate-change"&gt;renewable hydropower&lt;/a&gt; that’s abundant during the country’s wet season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmLrH2"&gt;Bitcoin’s future carbon footprint is similarly hard to parse. New rules and policies — like setting deadlines to ramp up clean energy or placing a carbon tax on bitcoin mining — could eventually minimize bitcoin’s toll on the climate. But without a coordinated global effort to tackle climate change, miners could move around to evade regulations on bitcoin and its energy use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHuedd"&gt;Thankfully, the most dire predictions of a bitcoin-driven energy apocalypse haven’t come to fruition. A 2017 study &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/bitcoin-mining-track-consume-worlds-energy-2020-744036"&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that bitcoin mining would eat up all of the world’s energy by 2020. While 2020 had a lot of problems, that wasn’t one of them. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Salesforce declares the 9-to-5 workday dead, will let some employees work remotely from now on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Re-opening Continues Across Densely Populated New York And New Jersey Areas" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T05M4SowHGmNhgEsvrjYCEsVmYw=/0x0:5027x3351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795433/1275529322.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VjPz8u"&gt;Cloud computing company Salesforce is joining other Silicon Valley tech giants in announcing a substantial shift in how it allows its employees to work. In a &lt;a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/creating-a-best-workplace-from-anywhere/"&gt;blog post published Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the company says the “9-to-5 workday is dead” and that it will allow employees to choose one of three categories that dictate how often, if ever, they return to the office once it’s safe to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQnjhb"&gt;Salesforce will also give employees more freedom to choose what their daily schedules look like. The company joins other tech firms like &lt;a href="http://horus.voxmedia.com/?page=1&amp;amp;order=date&amp;amp;community_id=372&amp;amp;q="&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; that have announced permanent work-from-home policies in response to the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHFPAC"&gt;“As we enter a new year, we must continue to go forward with agility, creativity and a beginner’s mind — and that includes how we cultivate our culture. An immersive workspace is no longer limited to a desk in our Towers; the 9-to-5 workday is dead; and the employee experience is about more than ping-pong tables and snacks,” writes Brent Hyder, Salesforce’s chief people officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4JqMeE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It no longer makes sense to expect employees to work an eight-hour shift and do their jobs successfully.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qraput"&gt;“In our always-on, always-connected world, it no longer makes sense to expect employees to work an eight-hour shift and do their jobs successfully,” Hyder adds. “Whether you have a global team to manage across time zones, a project-based role that is busier or slower depending on the season, or simply have to balance personal and professional obligations throughout the day, workers need flexibility to be successful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxhG88"&gt;Hyder cites picking up young kids from school or caring for sick family members as reasons why an employee should not be expected to report to work on a strict eight-hour shift every day. He also points to how the removal of strict in-office requirements will allow Salesforce to expand its recruitment of new employees beyond expensive urban centers like San Francisco and New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9buH53"&gt;In the blog post, Hyder defines the three different categories of work as flex, fully remote, and office-based. Flex would mean coming into the office one to three days per week and typically only for “team collaboration, customer meetings, and presentations,” and Salesforce expects most of its employees to fall into this category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2FoVmQ"&gt;Fully remote is what it sounds like — never coming into the office except perhaps in very rare situations or for work-related events. Office-based employees will be “the smallest population of our workforce,” Hyder says, and constitute employees whose roles require them be in the office four to five days per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwRlIz"&gt;“Our employees are the architects of this strategy, and flexibility will be key going forward,” Hyder writes. “It’s our responsibility as employers to empower our people to get the job done during the schedule that works best for them and their teams, and provide flexible options to help make them even more productive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykbCHz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcaSVz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CBS All Access will stop working on older Apple TVs when Paramount Plus launches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdgT-Fvws49JgbBeXlbcwOX4UJA=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795425/paramount_plus.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zmci8p"&gt;CBS All Access is set to transform into Paramount Plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238502/paramount-plus-launch-date-cbs-all-access-streaming-event-shows-movies"&gt;on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;, but you won’t be able to watch it if you own a second- or third-generation Apple TV. The company announced that it won’t update its app for those devices when the streaming service relaunches next month, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cXFVpeUIiBjRGsh-uCYsIRKxg6s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293308/apple_tv_3_cbs_all_access_discontinued.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/cbs-all-access-discontinued-apple-tv-3-march/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Cgub6Z"&gt;The announcement makes CBS All Access / Paramount Plus the latest service to end support for the set-top box. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265965/apple-tv-3rd-gen-youtube-native-onboard-support-airplay"&gt;YouTube announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will drop support starting next month, while HBO dropped the aging streaming boxes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216451/hbo-go-max-apple-tv-third-gen-support-extended-april"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. The second-gen Apple TV is over a decade old (it launched in 2010), while the third-generation version was released in 2012, so it’s understandable that we’re starting to see a wave of deprecated apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rhg6z"&gt;Users will still be able to stream Paramount Plus to older Apple TVs using an iPad or iPhone, however, so they won’t be completely locked out of their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQAxuR"&gt;Unlike the more recent Apple TV models (starting from 2015 and onward), which feature modern software and an App Store that makes it simple for developers to continue to update their apps, the older Apple TV models generally only saw updates to individual streaming applications when Apple updated the entire operating system — &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202157"&gt;an increasingly rare occurrence&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWq7q9"&gt;The sunsetting of the CBS app on older TVs isn’t the only change the Paramount Plus transition is causing: &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/09/cbs-showtime-bundle-apple-tv-app-paramount/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+9To5Mac-MacAllDay+%289+to+5+Mac+-+Apple+Intelligence%29"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; also notes&lt;/a&gt; that the company no longer offers its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21372128/apple-tv-plus-cbs-all-access-showtime-subscription-deal"&gt;discounted CBS All Access and Showtime bundle&lt;/a&gt; for Apple TV Plus subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine has been confusing from the start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cares Worker Receives The Covid-19 Vaccine" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LhrAeAfhQIwbIgRqR16WqR6rdtk=/78x0:3479x2267/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795399/1301049483.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Karwai Tang/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6sYJxg"&gt;South Africa announced this week that it’s stopping the use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine after a small study found that it wasn’t effective against mild and moderate disease. Other vaccines are also less effective in South Africa, where a variant of the virus with mutations that can dodge antibodies is circulating widely. The AstraZeneca-Oxford product appears to be the worst of all, and it fell down to less than 50 percent effective (the benchmark health agencies set for COVID-19 vaccines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kh90fF"&gt;It’s another hit for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/business/covid-vaccine-oxford-astrazeneca.html"&gt;dogged by shaky relationships with regulators&lt;/a&gt; and limited transparency for months. But it’s also a confusing result: the small trial wasn’t able to figure out if the vaccine could protect against severe disease and death, just that it didn’t perform well against mild and moderate cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3QVMH"&gt;The rollout of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has been messy from the start. The team behind it was one of the most &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-15/oxford-s-covid-19-vaccine-is-the-coronavirus-front-runner"&gt;vocally optimistic&lt;/a&gt; groups about the potential of its product, and the company said last spring that it could start delivering doses &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/astrazeneca-advances-response-to-global-covid-19-challenge-as-it-receives-first-commitments-for-oxfords-potential-new-vaccine.html"&gt;by September 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Former President Donald Trump’s Department of Health and Human Services jumped on those projections, saying vaccines would arrive in the United States &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/05/21/trump-administration-accelerates-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-to-be-available-beginning-in-october.html"&gt;in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1d1yV"&gt;Those projections would prove unrealistic. Clinical trials of the vaccine were paused over &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/business/covid-vaccine-oxford-astrazeneca.html"&gt;safety concerns&lt;/a&gt; in September, slowing its progress, and initial data wasn’t released until late November. At that time, the company announced that the vaccine was up to 90 percent effective, a huge accomplishment. Later, it turned out that the high efficacy was only in a small number of people who were incorrectly given weaker doses of the vaccine. Weirdly, the company’s two full-strength doses seemed less effective. The data was &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/coronavirus-vaccine-astrazeneca-oxford.html"&gt;hard to interpret&lt;/a&gt; and seemed counterintuitive to researchers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hxq2Jv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Astrazeneca/Oxford get a poor grade for transparency and rigor when it comes to the vaccine trial results they have reported. This is not like Pfizer or Moderna where we had the protocols in advance and a pre-specified primary analysis was reported. 1/5&lt;/p&gt;— Natalie E. Dean, PhD (@nataliexdean) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nataliexdean/status/1331355221549670400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 24, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKE0AS"&gt;Still, the United Kingdom &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=astrazeneca+uk+authorized&amp;amp;rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS895US895&amp;amp;oq=astrazeneca+uk+authorized&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0j0i22i30j69i60.3852j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;authorized&lt;/a&gt; the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine in December. In one bit of good news, a study last week indicated that it could protect people against the more contagious variant &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3779160"&gt;spreading widely&lt;/a&gt; there. But that variant is still changing. In &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/concerning-coronavirus-mutation-now-found-in-uk-variant-heres-what-you-need-to-know-153248"&gt;a few cases in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, it has developed one of the mutations that helps the variant most prevalent in South Africa avoid antibodies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRrVFV"&gt;The halting rollout and confusion around the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine shows how much of a lucky break both the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines were. They are both overwhelmingly effective. The companies first released data in press releases, &lt;a href="https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/27/covid-19-vaccines-where-are-the-data/"&gt;frustrating&lt;/a&gt; some scientists, but they still ended up presenting &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/florian_krammer/status/1336362836688297992"&gt;clear&lt;/a&gt; and consistent data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEEUyE"&gt;It may turn out that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine still helps protect against hospitalization and death from the coronavirus variant in South Africa. Although the rollout of the shots to the public is on pause, the country plans to give the vaccine to a subset of healthcare workers and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-55999678"&gt;check if that lowers hospitalization rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFHnS3"&gt;If that’s the case, it could still be a useful tool against COVID-19. “The retention of meaningful impact against severe disease is a very plausible scenario,” Katherine O’Brien, head of the World Health Organization’s Department of Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals, said in a press conference this week. But figuring out where and when this vaccine works best will mean untangling data streams, and it will take more time. That process is another wrinkle for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine and a cautionary tale as coronavirus variants spread: immunizations are crucial tools, but they’re not a straight shot out of the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="olnn28"&gt;Twitter doesn’t need Donald Trump to keep growing. The company said today that it ended 2020 with 192 million daily users, and the figure continued to grow in January — the month when Trump was banned from the platform. Twitter didn’t offer a specific daily usage figure for January, but it said daily user growth was “above the historical average from the last four years.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3sqXj"&gt;“We are a platform that is obviously much larger than any one topic or account,” Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey said — without specifying which one account he might have in mind — on a call with investors today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YpDub"&gt;The usage details were given in &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/826641620/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FINAL-Q4'20-TWTR-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;Twitter’s Q4 2020 earnings release&lt;/a&gt;, which covers October through the end of December 2020. That means the release wouldn’t normally touch on information from January, but Twitter said it was offering the details “given the unusual circumstances this quarter.” It’s not clear how much Trump’s presence boosted usage of Twitter over the years, but the expectation has been that having the president of the United States as a regular user was probably to Twitter’s benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cn9cdA"&gt;Though the Trump ban may not have had an immediate impact, Twitter does warn that its growth is going to slow. The company says that after “our tremendous growth in 2020,” the figures for 2021 are going to look a little worse. For the first three months of 2021, Twitter expects to grow daily users by 20 percent year over year, down from 24 percent in 2020. Twitter expects growth in the “low double digits” for the remainder of the year, with Q2 being the low point. Twitter says the slowdown is due to “the significant pandemic-related surge” in usage last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fx0CBV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 9th, 6:47PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with a comment from Twitter’s investor call.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
