    <title>These wireless gaming earbuds deliver less lag but not much more</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Almost a great gaming gadget&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="3jd5gG"&gt;The $199 GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds from audio company EPOS are, to my knowledge, the first truly wireless earbuds made for gaming — but the buds themselves aren’t the biggest selling point. The USB-C Bluetooth receiver that comes with the earbuds gets that distinction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPafR5"&gt;It’s much more compact than the standard flash drive-sized USB dongles included with many headsets. It’s more capable, too, operating with the aptX low latency (aptX LL) codec that delivers good-sounding audio with no perceivable lag. Using the receiver, the GTW 270 Hybrid can be especially great for fast-paced games where sound cues count for success; but really, it’s nice to have for any title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5srGRy"&gt;However, there is one problem: the microphones don’t work when you’re listening to audio via the USB-C receiver. (The earbuds’ built-in microphones do work, however, when they’re paired to a device via Bluetooth.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORFC4K6Lezv5xKvsviZb60aZ_6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247792/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the star of the show.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbrj5B"&gt;This falls more on the technical limitations of aptX than EPOS’s decision-making. In an effort to prioritize bandwidth for sound quality and responsiveness, only the playback channel is active when you’re listening using the USB-C dongle. That’s a potential deal-breaker for some gamers who might want to be able to jump into a voice chat with friends on their consoles. But to EPOS’s credit, the latency between the dongle and the earphones &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;does seem&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;nonexistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzjl72"&gt;These gunmetal-colored buds have a simple, understated design so that they don’t poke out too much from your ear. They aren’t too heavy, and the fit is comfortable, thanks to swappable silicone ear tips that help to get a good seal in your ear. As for controls, they have just a single multifunction button that handles pausing and resuming music, changing tracks, as well as picking up phone calls. In other words, without the USB-C dongle, these aren’t that special. (EPOS does make a $169 version sans dongle.) For general use — such as phone calls or music — you can get more by spending less if you check out some of the options in my colleague Chris Welch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;affordable wireless earbud buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pcSqcm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10294264"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7EfIqn"&gt;Outside of gaming, these earbuds can be used like any other wireless set to connect to your phone, tablet, or laptop via Bluetooth. They support Bluetooth 5.1 (with the SBC or aptX codec, depending on the device you connect to) for music, videos, games, and phone calls, and EPOS says you can pair them with up to eight devices. Pairing is done by holding down the button on the charging case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-2LUh-JKNl-S0bF430gIO1vIbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247789/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid’s only button is on the left earbud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c3R2Rt"&gt;Speaking of the charging case: it has an all-metal design that’s unfortunately very easy to scratch. It charges via USB-C; with a full charge, EPOS says it can deliver up to 15 hours of extra battery life to the earphones. During the review period, the GTW 270 Hybrid earbuds made it to the five-hour mark for battery life, which matches the company’s claim. And if you’re someone who goes on the occasional sweaty jog or just doesn’t want to get caught in the rain, these are IPX5 water resistant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYhNVH"&gt;I’ve spent the past few weeks using the earbuds to play games alternately on my PS5, my Switch, and my work laptop several times each day. (In case you’re curious, there’s an adapter included that lets you plug the dongle into a device that has USB Type-A ports.) The GTW 270 Hybrid works like any wireless gaming headset, but the truly wireless form factor has some obvious advantages. I like that they let me move around uninhibited by wires, and using them doesn’t isolate me (or mess up my hair) as much as bulky over-ear cans. The receiver is pre-paired to the buds, and they connect almost instantly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__j7V3C7h9-P_C1JzfzGzEAB-b4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247791/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each earbud charges via contact points, and the LEDs indicate remaining battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nRmKDf"&gt;I also love the convenience of being able to use just the right earbud (the right one controls the Bluetooth transmission, so listening through the left earbud alone doesn’t work), so I can keep an ear available to listen for packages being dropped off. This, of course, is nothing new for people who already use truly wireless earbuds. It just feels new to experience this freedom with a gaming headset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R2bp8q"&gt;I sampled the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake, 2018’s &lt;em&gt;God of War, Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;, along with a few other games, during the review period. While they don’t have the widest soundstage or the clearest frequency separation I’ve heard for listening to music, they shine with game audio — in particular, with surround sound effects and bass delivery. The overall sound quality isn’t explosively robust, and there’s a limit to how immersive the surround sound effects can be, given the earbuds’ small drivers. But the sound isn’t too compromised. Unless you’re a hardcore gamer who needs to hear every detail in crystal-clear presentation, these will likely suit you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="EPOS GTW 270 Hybrid" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8f0cSVrV14pGvIeyGcmkhA82cYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22247793/cfaulkner_210114_4373_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These work gloriously with the PS5 as well as the Switch. A USB-C to USB Type-A adapter is included to expand compatibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PXUK2C"&gt;The GTW 270 Hybrid would be very close to ideal if the microphones worked while connected using the USB-C dongle. Alas, they don’t, so using the dongle will be next to useless for those who frequently play multiplayer games with friends. (It’s a slightly different story if you play lots of single-player games and don’t mind not having a microphone for gaming.) Since the earbuds are not all that useful for gaming without the dongle, that means you’re making a big compromise, and it’s one that none of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy#:~:text=Best%20wired%20gaming%20headset%3A%20Bose%20QC%2035%20II%20gaming%20headset&amp;amp;text=Despite%20costing%20more%20than%20an,and%20wired%203.5mm%20connectivity."&gt;best gaming headsets I’ve tested&lt;/a&gt; (most of which are cheaper than this) ask you to make. It’s your choice.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pebble founder promises iMessage on Android and Windows with universal chat app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1wZFTB046HpKA-ZWB_QfputIBo=/0x0:1715x1143/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698998/msedge_cx5MYIw6nR.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s website promises “a single app to chat on iMessage, WhatsApp, and 13 other networks.”&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: BeeperHQ.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vJaaDX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.beeperhq.com/"&gt;Beeper&lt;/a&gt; is a new universal chat app that’s an attempt to unify 15 different chat platforms into a single interface. The app is the work of a team that includes Eric Migicovsky, the CEO and founder of former smartwatch manufacturer Pebble, who announced its launch on Twitter. Beeper’s site notes that the project was previously known as NovaChat, and requires a $10 per month subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3OMhW"&gt;Although Beeper integrates with world’s most popular messaging services like WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram, Slack, Twitter, Discord, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, it’s the support for Apple’s iMessage that’s perhaps most interesting. iMessage is only officially available on Apple devices, and it’s often cited by users as something that prevents them switching to Android. Migicovsky says Beeper should allow iMessage to work on Android, Windows, and Linux, but admits that it’s “using some trickery” in doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e7mXgX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;And yes, iMessage works even on Android, Windows and Linux using some trickery :)&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351932357201154048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="glUzzv"&gt;An FAQ on Beeper’s website gives a more in-depth explanation of exactly what this trickery involves. If you’ve got an always-online Mac, then you can install the Beeper Mac app to act as a bridge, similar to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/02/imessages-on-android/"&gt;the approach AirMessage uses&lt;/a&gt;. But things get really wild if you don’t have access to a Mac, at which point Beeper says it’ll literally send each of its users a “Jailbroken iPhone with the Beeper app installed” in order to act as a bridge. At this point we should probably mention that using Beeper involves paying a $10 a month subscription, which may or may not include the cost of the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5nS9e"&gt;Just in case you thought Beeper was joking, in a followup tweet, Migicovsky said that he currently has 50 old iPhone 4S’s at his desk, ready to be upcycled for use with Beeper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZqpVf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/fQ960gU7Xm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fQ960gU7Xm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Migicovsky (@ericmigi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericmigi/status/1351936829017083906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6zcLez"&gt;If the workaround works as Beeper claims, then the result should be a universal chat app that works across MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android, offering a unified inbox, and the ability to search across messages from each of the 15 services. It’s built on the open source Matrix messaging protocol (Migicovsky &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#315f:~:text=The%20only%20downside%20to%20Matrix%20is,the%20waiting%20list%20to%20use%20it."&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; NovaChat’s relationship to Matrix as akin to Gmail’s relationship with email), and although the client app itself isn’t open source, the bridges connecting it to other chat services are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbZT0G"&gt;Oh, and there’s a dark mode coming in Beeper’s next update, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3taZS3X_tQWFDqp5nn7mbulfSZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249728/6006a93e8082353374b0cd22_beeperSearch.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beeper&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beeper’s interface can include chats from multiple different services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="W4JSXX"&gt;While the short-term aim is to make it easier to chat to people across different chat apps, eventually Migicovsky has talked about the prospect of &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@ericmigi/the-universal-communication-bus-42dfb9a141ad#e362:~:text=These%20bridges%20are%20actually%20just%20an,need%20for%20bridges%20gradually%20over%20time."&gt;everyone using Matrix itself&lt;/a&gt; to chat with friends and colleagues, rather than simply using it as a bridge between services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOpjih"&gt;Although Migicovsky says he’s been using Beeper as his default chat client for the past two years, it doesn’t appear to be widely available just yet. Instead, Beeper asks prospective users to fill out a form on its website for an invitation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpXTUd"&gt;Here’s the full list of chat services that Beeper currently supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WXWYqb"&gt;Whatsapp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Qxrw5I"&gt;Facebook Messenger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vQZ1eg"&gt;iMessage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Phn8Xh"&gt;Android Messages (SMS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wa0ikm"&gt;Telegram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5dL2i7"&gt;Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZnJXG"&gt;Slack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XyQ9da"&gt;Hangouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QvDOmp"&gt;Instagram&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aDk10y"&gt;Skype&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NX1KQr"&gt;IRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4GZTjq"&gt;Matrix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kKCCjk"&gt;Discord&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vIljWB"&gt;Signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSr2xk"&gt;Beeper network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wgn4qg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ7mF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s first VR headset reportedly includes a fabric design, a fan, and expensive price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/--mchtKKykT_pIeLMrTf_7Q5150=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698961/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IZTva7"&gt;Apple is reportedly working on a VR headset that will include a fabric design, a fan, and an expensive price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-21/apple-s-first-vr-headset-to-be-niche-precursor-to-eventual-ar-glasses"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s first VR headset may launch as soon as 2022 as a standalone device that operates through batteries, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on “some of its most advanced and powerful chips” for this unannounced VR headset, with some chips reportedly beating its own M1 Mac processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjaoPC"&gt;Apple has reportedly faced challenges in the development of this headset, with some prototypes ending up too big and heavy. Apple is reportedly using a fabric exterior to reduce the headset weight, but the company is also using a fan — an unusual move for Apple given its emphasis on fan-less design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tii31X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the size of Apple’s VR headset, which is codenamed N301, is similar to the Oculus Quest, and some prototypes being tested include external cameras to enable some AR features. Apple is also reportedly testing the ability to use these cameras to track hand movements, and include software features like a virtual keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tT2Mk"&gt;It’s not clear exactly when Apple’s VR headset will launch, but it could be as soon as 2022. It will reportedly be an expensive and niche device, with some at Apple rumored to be anticipating that the company may sell only one headset per day at each of its retail stores, or less than 200,000 units per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frWB0X"&gt;Apple has been working on VR and AR headsets for years, according to various reports. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt; also published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;detailed look at Apple’s VR and AR ambitions&lt;/a&gt; last year, noting that the company has around 1,000 people working on AR and VR.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Linux has been ported to run on Apple’s M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: MacBook Pro 13 (late 2020)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-IpwDW3GHZj5o-3J6zhfJoB6t0o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698905/vpavic_4291_20201113_0326.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8tKNyW"&gt;A new Linux port allows Apple’s M1 Macs to run Ubuntu for the first time. Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing, has successfully ported Ubuntu over to M1 Macs and released a tutorial for others to follow. The modified version of Ubuntu boots into the regular user interface and includes USB support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yav1NU"&gt;The team at Corellium have &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;detailed exactly how&lt;/a&gt; they managed to get Ubuntu running, and it’s a good in-depth read if you’re interested in the details. While a number of M1 components are shared with Apple’s mobile chips, the non-standard chips made it challenging to create Linux drivers to get Ubuntu running properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtsFHk"&gt;Apple hasn’t designed its M1 Macs with dual-boot or Boot Camp in mind. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp"&gt;has previously ruled out official support&lt;/a&gt; for natively booting alternate operating systems like Windows or Linux. Virtualization seems to be Apple’s preferred method, but that hasn’t stopped people from making their own ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eFKgh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Linux is now completely usable on the Mac mini M1. Booting from USB a full Ubuntu desktop (rpi). Network works via a USB c dongle. Update includes support for USB, I2C, DART. We will push changes to our GitHub and a tutorial later today. Thanks to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CorelliumHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CorelliumHQ&lt;/a&gt; team ❤️  &lt;a href="https://t.co/uBDbDmvJUG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uBDbDmvJUG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chris Wade (@cmwdotme) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="v56Gaz"&gt;Hector Martin, a developer who regularly gets Linux running on a variety of hardware, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcan42/status/1333459867323957251?s=21"&gt;also porting Linux to M1 Macs&lt;/a&gt;. Developers seem to be enticed by the performance benefits offered by Apple’s M1 chips, and the ability to run Linux on a silent ARM-based machine. “I’ve been waiting for an ARM laptop that can run Linux for a &lt;em&gt;long &lt;/em&gt;time,” said Linux creator Linus Torvalds &lt;a href="https://www.realworldtech.com/forum/?threadid=196533&amp;amp;curpostid=196570"&gt;back in November&lt;/a&gt;. “The new Air would be almost perfect, except for the OS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz7P96"&gt;Corellium CTO Chris Wade describes this new port as “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cmwdotme/status/1351838924621099008"&gt;completely usable&lt;/a&gt;” on a Mac Mini M1, and it works by booting the full Ubuntu desktop from USB. You will need a USB-C dongle to get networking working, though, and the process to get the port running will require some familiarity with Linux and custom kernels. Corellium has posted a &lt;a href="https://corellium.com/blog/linux-m1"&gt;tutorial on the process&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested in trying this beta project out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmANmX"&gt;Corellium has some experience in working around Apple’s operating system protections. Corellium offers security researchers a virtual iPhone to help with vulnerability exploration. It’s a process that has angered Apple enough to file lawsuits against Corellium. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22205130/apple-corellium-dismissed-copyright-dmca-fair-use"&gt;Apple lost an early challenge&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium late last year, after initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;filing a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against the company on copyright grounds back in August 2019. Apple later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;alleged DMCA violations&lt;/a&gt; in January 2020, and a judge dismissed the copyright infringement claims in December. A ruling on the separate DMCA allegations has been deferred.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter locks out China’s US embassy after ‘baby-making machines’ tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UyByA7wbJWkCFf5PN-MTBqnQmWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698794/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uTzSVD"&gt;Twitter has locked the official account for China’s US embassy, over a tweet it said violated its policy against dehumanization, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-20/twitter-locks-out-chinese-embassy-in-u-s-over-post-on-uighurs?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The tweet, which was originally shared on January 7th, referred to Uighur women as “baby-making machines” prior to government intervention. Twitter removed the tweet and replaced it with a notice saying it’s no longer available. However, Twitter requires account owners to manually delete tweets that violate its rules before unlocking accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7NcFA"&gt;Twitter confirmed the account’s locking in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “We have taken action on this Tweet for violating our policy against dehumanization,” and said the platform prohibits dehumanization of a group of people based on their “religion, caste, age, disability, serious disease, national origin, race, or ethnicity.” As of this writing, the last tweet from the Chinese Embassy in US account was from almost two weeks ago on January 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z6XUc3AXOSIUlZJaFi8Tx7IFrXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22249693/msedge_mbKakxD6xa.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Twitter.com&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jan 7th tweet is no longer visible on the account, but must be manually deleted for the account to be unlocked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4xqyQJ"&gt;China has faced fierce criticism of its treatment of minority Uighur Muslims living in the Xinjiang province, with critics alleging that it is forcibly sterilizing Uighur women. The United Nations estimates that as many as 1 million Uighurs may be held in camps in the region, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. On Tuesday, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China’s treatment of the Uighurs amounts to “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/19/mike-pompeo-china-uighur-genocide-sanctions-xinjiang"&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwvTss"&gt;At a briefing in Beijing, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that the embassy was “puzzled” by the account lock, and said the embassy was attempting to correct “fake reports and information related to Xinjiang.” In tweets that are still visible on its US page, the Chinese Embassy has shared reports and infographics relating to population growth and its policies in Xinjiang. The embassy joined Twitter in 2019, as part of a broader effort by China to counter criticism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4HrlK"&gt;Twitter has previously been criticized by former President Donald Trump and his allies who claimed the social network was unfairly targeting Republicans while allowing foreign governments to violate its policies. In May 2020, in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271207/twitter-donald-trump-fact-check-mail-in-voting-coronavirus-pandemic-california"&gt;warning labels being placed on his tweets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679#main-heading:~:text=Twitter%20is%20doing%20nothing%20about%20all%20of%20the%20lies%20%26%20propaganda%20being%20put%20out%20by%20China%20or%20the%20Radical%20Left%20Democrat%20Party.,Until%20then%2C%20it%20will%20be%20regulated!"&gt;Trump claimed&lt;/a&gt; the social network was “doing nothing about all of the lies &amp;amp; propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXUO4l"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52846679"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC News &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter had previously removed a tweet by Iranian Leader Supreme Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and suspended accounts associated with Cuban President Raul Castro and members of his government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uplxpd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Display is mass-producing 90Hz OLED screens for laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csL2IYbtyWjz_9k55HsnJzN7_38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68698695/mchin_200402_3957_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung’s 2020 Galaxy Chromebook. | Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZSazv"&gt;Samsung Display has announced plans to mass-produce the world’s first 90Hz OLED screens designed for laptops and says that “several global IT companies” are expected to release models with the new panels this year. Manufacturing will begin in March in “very large quantities,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210120005673/en/Samsung-Display-to-Introduce-First-90Hz-OLED-Laptop-Display/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; attributed to CEO Choi Joo-sun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwwynE"&gt;The panels are 14-inch in size, though Samsung Display hasn’t given details on specs like aspect ratio or resolution; it’s possible that there will be multiple versions available. Samsung does cite the faster response time of its OLED panels, claiming “practically” the same amount of blurring as a 120Hz LCD when displaying fast-moving content. No potential laptop OEM partners were named in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9WOr5"&gt;OLED displays aren’t unheard of in laptops, but they’re not at all commonplace. While quite a few gaming laptops offer them as an option, the tradeoff there is that you’ve had to give up on high refresh rates. And despite Samsung itself launching an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;OLED-equipped Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; last year, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;2021 followup&lt;/a&gt; uses a cheaper QLED-branded LCD display instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il4SQ9"&gt;Samsung is the world’s biggest vendor of OLED display panels, so the announcement today suggests that OLED laptops are likely to become much more of a common sight this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden cancels Keystone XL permit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activists In Chicago Protest Against Dakota Pipeline" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DmBBgpvC0627lo4VP-jMEO8Zys=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697834/633837604.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Demonstrators rally near Trump Tower while protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline on February 4, 2017 in Chicago, Illinois. President Donald Trump had recently signed executive actions to advance approval of Dakota Access and the Keystone XL pipelines, undermining efforts by the administration of President Barack Obama to block their construction. | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ii95so"&gt;In one of his first actions in office, President Joe Biden issued an executive order on a broad range of environmental protections that included stopping construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This is the second time a president has pumped the brakes on the embattled pipeline. Barack Obama denied a permit for the project in 2015. Then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/24/15047936/trump-keystone-xl-pipeline-decision-climate-environment"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, Donald Trump reversed that decision and issued a permit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AzaMvE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Back on the right footing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2bnTd"&gt;The order directed federal agencies to review environmental rollbacks made under the Trump Administration, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-cancel-keystone-xl-pipeline-permit_n_60076208c5b6df63a91abf63"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/biden-executive-action.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;That includes revisiting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;fuel efficiency standards&lt;/a&gt;, and the boundaries for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/4/16735910/trump-national-monuments-utah-bears-ears-grand-staircase-escalante-cuts"&gt;Bears Ears and Grand Staircase Escalante&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;national monuments.  It also temporarily halts oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofcRFr"&gt;Gina McCarthy, national climate advisor, said Biden’s moves “begin to put the U.S. back on the right footing, a footing we need to restore American leadership, helping to position our nation to be the global leader in clean energy and jobs,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20210120-on-day-one-biden-to-sign-orders-reversing-trump-policies-on-climate-virus-immigration"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Agence France-Presse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmnkNa"&gt;830,000 barrels of crude oil were expected to flow through the $8 billion Keystone XL pipeline every day. In an apparent last-minute attempt to get the project in Biden’s good graces, on January 17th, the company said it would spend $1.7 billion to purchase enough renewable energy to match the pipeline’s power consumption by 2030. Keystone XL developer TC Energy suspended work on the pipeline today and said in a &lt;a href="https://www.tcenergy.com/announcements/2021-01-20-tc-energy-disappointed-with-expected-executive-action-revoking-keystone-xl-presidential-permit/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that it is “disappointed” with Biden’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W9fOQ"&gt;For more than a decade, Native American tribes, activists, and environmentalists have fought to stop the 1,210-mile-long pipeline from being built. Obama backed away from the pipeline just before the adoption of the Paris climate agreement, &lt;a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2015/11/06/statement-president-keystone-xl-pipeline"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt; that approving the project would do little for the US economy and would instead undercut US leadership on climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZAUC9"&gt;The pipeline continued to face opposition and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18078490/keystone-xl-judge-blocks-construction-2018-montana-judge"&gt;legal challenges&lt;/a&gt; after Trump gave it the green light in 2017. The Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes of the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation &lt;a href="https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/"&gt;filed lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against the administration. They say that the administration failed to consult with the tribes and that the pipeline poses a danger to their lands and water sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oZv5O2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Activists are pushing Biden to stop the construction of other pipelines&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YdfR9A"&gt;This is just one piece of Biden’s plan to transition the US away from fossil fuels driving the climate crisis. The climate change plan he developed while on the campaign trail includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;goals&lt;/a&gt; to get the US to “100 percent clean energy” by 2050. Biden also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239441/us-paris-agreement-rejoin-climate-change-joe-biden"&gt;recommitted the US to the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt; today, a global pact to avoid that tipping point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MpicB9"&gt;Activists are pushing Biden to stop the construction of other pipelines, &lt;a href="https://indiancountrytoday.com/news/keystone-xl-is-out-dakota-access-next-2oGuwLyth0K5eVjG2Uy8-g?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=107179902&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_PwARR-m4TSrWXeUUAb1t1GoL749iT55M57TVGJHEMVRzw7JaRX4VmbxmrZMc4KuW7LWTT4HMlPqQ9nfkl4QJ-xysQufbAtb5kC4PdCzGFS1iB4z4&amp;amp;utm_content=107179902&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;including the Dakota Access pipeline&lt;/a&gt; — which Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/24/14373858/trump-executive-order-dakota-access-keystone-xl-pipelines-dapl-nodapl"&gt;similarly expedited&lt;/a&gt;, despite high-profile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/4/13836744/dakota-access-pipeline-halt-standing-rock-army-corps-engineers"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; in defense of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s water supply and land. There are also calls to stop the Enbridge Line 3 project, a plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356423/oil-gas-pipelines-abandoned-enbridge-line-3"&gt;abandon an aging pipeline&lt;/a&gt; that runs between Alberta and the Midwestern US and replace it with a new one that can transport more oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dkqKN"&gt;“Suspending one big oil expansion project through Native territory and approving another is the opposite of climate leadership and respect for Indigenous sovereignty,” Tara Houska, a citizen of Couchiching First Nation Anishinaabe and &lt;a href="https://grist.org/briefly/meet-the-fixer-this-lawyer-stands-with-indigenous-activists/"&gt;prominent attorney&lt;/a&gt;, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.wecaninternational.org/PressReleases/Indigenous-Women-Call-Upon-Biden-to-Stop-Pipelines-and-Uphold-Indigenous-Rights-in-the-Wake-of-Escalating-Climate-Chaos-and-Covid-19-Crises"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; penned by Indigenous women leaders on January 14th. “The Biden administration can uphold their climate justice claims by acting to Stop Line 3, Stop Keystone XL, and Stop Dakota Access Pipeline, now.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="0bSjHr"&gt;The computer is described as the very first Mac Pro produced at the Flex Factory in Austin, Texas.

    <title>Among Us developers explain why new features are taking a while</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vOvYEy1zOhxwra3u0GFn1K4QW6c=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697640/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Innersloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zZmieB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was one of the smash hits of 2020 — it reportedly had nearly half a billion players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;in November&lt;/a&gt; — and there are some exciting updates announced for the game, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;new airship map&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2020/11/03/among-us-will-soon-get-player-accounts-and-a-massive-new-map/"&gt;account system&lt;/a&gt;. In a blog &lt;a href="https://innersloth.itch.io/among-us/devlog/202874/the-upcoming-airship-map-consoles-and-whats-next-"&gt;posted yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, developer Innersloth discussed how it has adapted in response to the game’s enormous popularity and why new features are taking a while to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt7Hp3"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; gained incredible traction pretty late into 2020 that we weren’t expecting, and that meant A LOT of change for us,” the developers said. Innersloth, which is comprised of just four employees, had to spend two months restructuring, figuring out processes, and working with new external partners, according to the blog. “It’s all behind-the-scenes work, and while it meant time away from the game, it’ll make it easier for current and future us to develop the game better,” Innersloth said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFiiBf"&gt;The studio has also juggled bringing the game to new platforms — it hit Nintendo Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt; and is coming to Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/10/among-us-coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc/"&gt;in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iubiOk"&gt;There’s a lot to look forward to, though. The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ixfokUG711U"&gt;airship map&lt;/a&gt;, which is scheduled to come out in early 2021, has new tasks to complete as well as ladders and floating platforms for traversal. Innersloth aims to launch the account system “ASAP” with a focus on moderation. And the studio plans to share a public feature roadmap at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Metroid looks amazing in Lego — and could become real if you vote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTMu5Wz4rCFEUDpcjv9y4p-2mFQ=/0x3:1163x778/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68697636/native_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: L-DI-EGO on Lego Ideas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kMPUww"&gt;If you want a &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; Lego set, you have the power to bring the idea closer to reality. User L-DI-EGO &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/0ca0ae99-d79e-4fb2-91c1-332aee51220d"&gt;has submitted a design&lt;/a&gt; on Lego’s Ideas website that brings the block treatment to Samus and her gunship, but the site requires votes to get this concept in front of Lego itself (&lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/01/this_metroid_set_could_be_officially_reviewed_by_lego_with_your_votes"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR9PAD"&gt;Lego Ideas is an official site for users to submit their concepts and designs for the Lego company to consider, and where Lego fans can vote for their favorites. If a submission gets 10,000 votes, the Lego Group may turn it into a real product. Right now the &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; concept has around 5,700 votes, so it’s just over halfway. If you like the concept, you can go to the website to put your thumb on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63kSqaTeYBtCrSJP0hyUoZEwNvs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248778/native_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: L-DI-EGO on Lego Ideas&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMkL3TIhsGDOH4aG8GlFTgsHyUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248781/49801176832_f3080d5d5e_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: L-DI-EGO on Lego Ideas&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EZyCKZ"&gt;It’s worth noting, however, that many of the submissions that do get 10,000 votes don’t actually end up hitting store shelves. The program has been running since 2008, and only 33 sets have made it to production so far. Lego only guarantees that it’ll look at the idea, but usually fans will end up waiting to hear back from the company only to get a rejection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKJyBv"&gt;That isn’t to say it’s impossible. Lego &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fthemes%2Fideas&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241339%2Fmetroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has a page listing some of the Ideas&lt;/a&gt; that you can buy today. The list includes the truly awesome &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Flego-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-92176&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241339%2Fmetroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1969-piece Saturn V rocket&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve written about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-gb%2Fproduct%2Fdoctor-who-21304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F20%2F22241339%2Fmetroid-lego-set-voting-process-ideas-nintendo#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Doctor Who set&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/1513c917-920f-4d72-b437-f5b0bb7d684d"&gt;started out as an Idea&lt;/a&gt;. Space ideas really seem to speak to Lego, as nearly a quarter of the sets produced (if you count WALL-E and Doctor Who) have been space-themed. This includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491956/lego-women-of-nasa-nancy-grace-roman-margaret-hamilton-sally-ride-mae-jemison"&gt;a Women of NASA kit&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075211/lego-international-space-station-iss-build-set-solar-panels-price"&gt;recreation of the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. Maybe that’s a good sign, since &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; is set in space?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a proposed Metroid Lego set" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/377gK6oaW-R6bXg1LpRFTqAsOJU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248628/native.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: L-DI-EGO on Lego Ideas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You wouldn’t see anything like this on Earth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_CKyfT5fuc4rD9o9pkIqcptAqQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248846/native_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: L-DI-EGO on Lego Ideas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would the official version of this look like? Still cool, I bet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2lHpVZ"&gt;Despite the space examples, the program doesn’t operate at warp speed. It can often take over a year from an idea getting reviewed to it being something you can buy: that Doctor Who kit got to 10,000 votes on April 7, 2014, and hit store shelves in December of 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tsQqn6"&gt;And even if the &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; idea does end up being produced by Lego, there are no promises it’ll look the same as it does now. Lego will often make changes to the Ideas designs. You can see this by comparing the &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/6f1d4d6e-f47a-467a-8b10-d918d04e6d5c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; set from 2011&lt;/a&gt;. On the top is the Ideas version, and on the bottom is the retail packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOkBL1OYiOnnDWTPC7DnvIiSHDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248831/native_2.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lKdr2lwy4XZjHE4aK8YlkVPn5TA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248834/slack_imgs.com_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lego&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hoverboard and Doc’s fit are clear downgrades.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPHh6"&gt;While Lego deciding to make this &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; set may be unlikely, it already has a relationship with Nintendo from the work the companies have done on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292132/lego-super-mario-sets-hands-on-nintendo-interview-play-toys"&gt;couple of Super Mario sets&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21322481/lego-nintendo-nes-super-mario-interactive-set-replica"&gt;a version of the NES&lt;/a&gt; that’s just as endearingly blocky as the system’s graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwgfDa"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Metroid&lt;/em&gt; isn't your preferred Nintendo franchise, there’s an &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/1805191a-e125-42e8-b7e6-178bc8794b3e"&gt;Animal Crossing set&lt;/a&gt; that’s &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; under the 10,000 vote line. It’s got over 9,000 votes, so it just needs a small push to make it to Lego’s desk. And, if you want to spend an evening dreaming about Lego sets that aren’t likely to ever come out, I suggest you &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/search/global_search/ideas?idea_phase=idea_in_review&amp;amp;query=&amp;amp;sort=top"&gt;take a look at the Ideas sets that are currently pending review&lt;/a&gt; — there’s some great ones in there, &lt;a href="https://ideas.lego.com/projects/7268ebc2-160d-4480-8b47-6fa68fa5564a"&gt;including Tom Nook’s infamous shop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of an Animal Crossing lego set, including a house, beach, workbench, and river." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9E7OJrAdxVG9aADXfcVb6A8nXFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248663/native.jpeg"&gt;
