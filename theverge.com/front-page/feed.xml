    <title>Google’s Sonos lawsuit dodge might let other phone makers do what Pixel cannot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WFtwxZ"&gt;You might think a Google phone would be the best choice to control your Google-branded speakers, but that’s not &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; true: Google’s actions have potentially opened the door for other manufacturers to do what the Pixel legally cannot, &lt;a href="https://blog.esper.io/android-12-cast-volume-changes-explained"&gt;writes Android sleuth Mishaal Rahman at Esper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIuYbl"&gt;Last week, we wrote how “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871304/google-home-speaker-group-volume-control-changes-sonos-patent-decision"&gt;Your Google home speakers are about to get slightly worse because Sonos sued and won&lt;/a&gt;.” If you’re using a Google Pixel, that’s true — among other things, you won’t be able to control the volume of a multi-zone Google Cast speaker group. That’s because the US International Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22871121/sonos-google-patent-itc-ruling-decision-import-ban"&gt;ruled that Google copied Sonos’ technology and threatened to block imports&lt;/a&gt; unless Google implemented five specific software tweaks. One of the Sonos patents specifically dealt with controlling volume of a multi-zone speaker group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnRml7"&gt;But when Rahman dug into the Android 12 code, he found that the &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; Google disabled remote speaker group volume control is incredibly basic: Google simply set a single value from “true” to “false” on its own Pixel phones. Rahman writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ns5C8p"&gt;the second patch seems tailored to allow Google to ship Pixel phones without the ability to control the volume of remote speaker group sessions. But it also leaves an easy way for OEMs to ship their own devices with the feature enabled. All an OEM would have to do is build AOSP with GMS and leave the default value (‘true’) for the config_volumeAdjustmentForRemoteGroupSessions flag in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rOt9Xi"&gt;It sounds like if Samsung or Xiaomi (currently the world’s top two Android manufacturers) want their phones to control the volume of an entire speaker group (something a Google Pixel can no longer do as of the latest update), they don’t have to lift any additional fingers. They just have to avoid intentionally turning it off. And Rahman says that — at least in beta — the upcoming Android 12L works this way as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ziko65"&gt;(For the uninitiated, “build AOSP with GMS” simply means to take &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;the basic version of Android&lt;/a&gt; that Google offers free to manufacturers, with the Google services &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194803/android-google-play-services-huawei-china"&gt;that the company generally licenses with it&lt;/a&gt;, which is what most Android phone makers do anyhow before they skin Android with additions of their own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcfDuW"&gt;None of this means that any phone maker will necessarily take Google up on this possibility. For all I know — I am not a lawyer — Sonos could just turn around and sue them, too, using its victory against Google as precedent. But it’s all very intriguing to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar Pichai were involved in ad collusion plot, claims court filing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eidkBoifkb2n3GlyrtR921n_UyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70390288/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hkPnkv"&gt;On Friday, a coalition of state attorneys general led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released a new antitrust complaint (&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21179902-3rd-complaint-for-texas-google-antitrust-case"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) against Google, giving more details into the company’s alleged collusion with Facebook in programmatic ad markets. The filing was &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/14/facebook-google-ad-market-lawsuit-527108"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXiiGx"&gt;First filed in November, the initial complaint (&lt;a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/global/images/TAC%20-%20Redacted%20Version%20(public).pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) alleged broad collusion between the two companies, particularly in a collaborative project codenamed “Jedi Blue” that saw the companies joining together to limit header bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z62agv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is a big deal strategically”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UxdnJU"&gt;Drawing on internal emails, Friday’s complaint shows that the Jedi Blue deal was reviewed at the highest levels of both companies, with personal involvement from Sundar Pichai, Sheryl Sandberg, and Mark Zuckerberg. In one email to Zuckerberg, Sandberg told the CEO “[t]his is a big deal strategically.” Notably, the filing refers to Zuckerberg and Sandberg by their job titles but redacts their name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJqIva"&gt;The legal implications of the allegations are still contested, and the distinction between normal business practices and anti-competitive behavior will be hotly debated in court. Still, the state attorneys general succeed in digging up a number of moments where the two ad giants seem to be settling into a collaborative duopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoulbT"&gt;In one particularly uncomfortable passage, the complaint quotes a 2015 email in which “Google employees expressed fear that Google’s exchange might ‘actually have to compete’ with other exchanges at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDvvgN"&gt;Much of the case rests on the concessions Google allegedly made to Facebook in the wake of the Jedi Blue arrangement, including lower fees and longer timeout limits in exchange bidding. One newly unredacted portion of the complaint claims that the concessions gave Facebook a clear advantage in winning auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="oVO8KI"&gt;One Facebook study in 2019 found that Facebook’s bids for in-app impressions won more frequently in Google-run auctions than they did on any other platform. At the same time, the average price Facebook paid per in-app impression was lower in Google-run auctions than it was on any other platform. This would be a puzzling result, to say the least, if Facebook faced the same competition for inventory across auction houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8hmxJ"&gt;The case comes amid a range of antitrust actions against Google, including parallel antitrust cases focusing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;search manipulation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567532/google-play-store-antitrust-lawsuit-state-ag-app-fees"&gt;its management of the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. But the complaint led by Texas is arguably the most important for the company, focusing on the programmatic ad networks that have long provided the bulk of the company’s revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukrunR"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment but described the complaint as “full of inaccuracies and lacks legal merit” in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bethesda will follow up Fallout 4’s real-life Pip-Boy with this Starfield smartwatch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3ZK6m271U7-6Ja1pGr-pwDGhiw=/168x0:1461x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70389610/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_17.57.35.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="egqIB3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;, Bethesda’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;upcoming space-themed game&lt;/a&gt;, may feature an in-game smartwatch that you’ll be able to get and wear in real life, based on an early copy of a manual &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/s2qbap/new_images_of_the_watch_i_found_along_with_draft/"&gt;found by Reddit user SquiddyVonn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://manuals.plus/the-wand-company/lpv6-chronomark-smartwatch-manual"&gt;The manual&lt;/a&gt; details the real-life watch’s functions, which include showing the weather and step tracking, and it even includes pictures that give us a good look at the interface. It also shows us that the watch is being made by a well-known replica company that’s &lt;a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/collections/wand-company"&gt;worked with Bethesda in the past&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VtHk"&gt;According to “The Wand Company LPV6 Chronomark Smartwatch User Manual,” the watch will be able to receive forecast information from a phone, display notifications, and show various sets of information on a series of watch faces. It also shows the watch’s “About” menu, which contains the line “©2022 Bethesda Softworks, a ZeniMax Media company.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuVuPLw6po_NPRlQmGHz37mZ5h0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167912/THE_WAND_COMPANY_LPV6_Chronomark_Smartwatch_FIg_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image via Manuals plus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The watch’s “Sunrise, sunset and moon phase” screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KCh3AQ"&gt;If the name “The Wand Company” rings a bell, it may be because of its work on other replicas — taking something that exists in a game, movie, or TV show and making a real-life version of it is kind of its thing. The company has made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/11/8933329/star-trek-tos-bluetooth-communicator-hands-on-sdcc-2015"&gt;Star Trek communicator replicas&lt;/a&gt; that you can use to make calls (though they use a Bluetooth connection to your phone, rather than far-future tech) and poké ball models that light up when you get your hand near them (but that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw"&gt;you &lt;em&gt;cannot&lt;/em&gt; throw&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e3LYE4alehDPDLnS7553G2byBbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167858/Screen_Shot_2022_01_13_at_17.44.25.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot of the watch from Bethesda’s video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4TFIj"&gt;While the manual gives us a good look at the watch, it’s not the first time we’ve seen it. &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-manual-and-images-of-a-starfield-collectors-edition-watch-have-been-spotted/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it also made a brief appearance in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Wun9up_M87E?t=91"&gt;a behind-the-scenes video from Bethesda&lt;/a&gt;, which was posted in June 2021 (it’s featured right around the 1:33 mark). The video version looks pretty much identical to the one seen in the manual, and the box it comes in appears to be a replica of a box found in the game’s teaser trailer — that could be another hint that the watch will have some sort of role in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4hv6Zl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10977258"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="beGfDj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt; is currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;slated to launch on November 11th&lt;/a&gt; for the PC and Xbox Series consoles. If the watch is set to be part of a collector’s edition, we’ll probably hear more about it before then.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peacemaker actually knows how to exist in a cinematic universe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeHMHh4rk-GegRF9UED-AIph5nQ=/106x72:1918x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70389602/john_cena_3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Warner Bros,&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UWZYap"&gt;Warner Bros. went out of its way to make sure that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352484/the-suicide-squad-trailer-james-gunn-hbo-max"&gt;James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t exactly looked at as a direct sequel to David Ayer’s &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; even though that’s what it was. In the case of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452994/peacemaker-hbo-max-spinoff-series-suicide-squad"&gt;HBO Max’s new &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;spinoff series, though, the studio’s taking a much different approach to addressing the connections between its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202992/dc-films-multiverse-batman-wonder-woman-aquaman-hbo-max-dceu-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;rather messy cinematic universe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XplUy0"&gt;It’s become commonplace for spinoff superhero series informed by the events of big superhero movies — Marvel’s latest batch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777033/marvel-disney-plus-agatha-spider-man"&gt;Disney Plus series&lt;/a&gt; all come to mind — to dance around the specific details of how they fit into the larger picture until about halfway through the season. Though you can usually infer that these sorts of shows are set after the events of the features that preceded them, they tend to feel as if you’re only meant to think about those details to a point and in the abstract until they can conveniently be pulled into the foreground mid-season for emotional impact. The obvious reason for this is that studios want their tie-in shows to feel like stories that can stand on their own and don’t want audiences to be scared off if they haven’t seen every single project within a franchise. But this approach to worldbuilding often comes at the cost of shows seeming as if they’re slightly out of place and time or as if they don’t know how to acknowledge significant events that their characters should be talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDugvr"&gt;While Warner Bros. likely had these concerns about &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;as well, the show’s first episode immediately establishes its connections to &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;with a level of straightforwardness that’s refreshing and something that more of these shows might want to consider. Before &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;properly gets going, it actually opens up with a full-on recap of &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;that clocks in at just over a minute and does an astonishingly solid job of getting you up to speed on a handful of key characters and moments from the film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOtqkg"&gt;It’s not immediately obvious from the recap alone which of &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;’s narrative threads &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;intends to pick up. But what’s very clear is how Peacemaker’s time working for Amanda Waller has impacted the arc of his near future. It’s interesting to consider whether Warner Bros. would have been comfortable giving &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;the “previously on” treatment if the movie hadn’t ended up premiering on HBO Max last summer due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;also had a theatrical release, it — along with the rest of Warner Bros.’ 2021 release slate — dropping day and date on a streaming service raised eyebrows and concerns last year as directors and cinema nerds bemoaned what that strategy might portend for the future of the industry. Mixed in with concerns about how streaming might hurt theaters was the common implication that any movie to premiere on a streaming platform was being made less than just by existing alongside content originally created to live on those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbCCw1"&gt;While studios obviously have a financial motivation to put their features up on pedestals that way, it can work against their interests when their interconnected franchises grow to be as big as the ones that Warner Bros. and Marvel have built out. Though Marvel still seems like it isn’t always sure how to talk about &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame &lt;/em&gt;in a way that feels organic and interesting, Warner’s in a somewhat different position simply because it hasn’t yet had that sort of massive event, and &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;is its first live-action superhero spinoff series to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrmtwH"&gt;Whether the handshake between &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker &lt;/em&gt;will end up factoring into the show’s first season being a success isn’t yet clear, but it’s the kind of move the studio might want to consider more in the future as it continues to release features both theatrically and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/bad-boys-for-life-filmmakers-to-direct-batgirl-movie-for-warner-bros-exclusive-1234950696/"&gt;on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZA1lB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; is now streaming on HBO Max with new episodes dropping every Thursday.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s long-in-the-works VR / AR headset may not launch until 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0FiP4hL1n8YKsPjdsWKSjVKPCns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70389013/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P1QRr9"&gt;Rumors have swirled for years about Apple releasing some kind of virtual reality / augmented reality headset. While reports had pegged a possible 2022 release for the company’s first mixed reality headset, the device is hitting some development snags and may not release until 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/apple-s-hotly-anticipated-headset-risks-being-delayed-until-2023?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHJRsu"&gt;Apple planned to reveal the headset at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, but “development challenges related to overheating, cameras and software have made it harder to stay on track,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. The issues mean the reveal may happen at the end of the year — or even later — with the headset going on sale in 2023. And Apple had apparently, at one point, planned to reveal the device even earlier; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports the company wanted to announce it in 2021 and ship it in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vb9Lo"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRU5Pg"&gt;This first headset is expected to be high end, with Apple considering prices above $2,000. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says it will have two processors, and at least one will be “on par” with the new M1 Pro chip that’s available with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;refreshed MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/26/22802981/apple-ar-headset-m1-processor-release-date-specs"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; that the device will have two chips with one being M1-adjacent. Previous reports have also said that the headset will have two 4K OLED microdisplays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22825675/apple-ar-headset-hand-tracking-controllers-kuo-report"&gt;3D sensors for hand tracking&lt;/a&gt;, among other advanced components, all of which could be contributing to the rumored high price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tpb5hc"&gt;Apple is also still working on a set of AR glasses, though they might be a long ways off. The company plans to introduce them “later this decade,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russia’s FSB says it has taken down REvil hacker group at US request</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nQYPPO"&gt;Russia’s domestic security service, the FSB, has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-arrests-dismantles-revil-hacking-group-us-request-report-2022-01-14/"&gt;arrested numerous members of the REvil hacking group&lt;/a&gt; at the request of the US government, the FSB said on Friday. The move, which marks an unusual degree of cooperation between Russian and US agencies, comes amid increasingly aggressive Russian military activity on the Ukrainian border and tense diplomacy as the United States attempts to prevent armed conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1jXZn"&gt;Reporting by the Russian &lt;em&gt;Interfax&lt;/em&gt; news agency claimed that the FSB &lt;a href="https://www.interfax.ru/russia/815466"&gt;seized 426 million rubles&lt;/a&gt; ($5.6 million) in a raid against 14 members of the group, along with more than $600,000 worth of cryptocurrency and 20 luxury cars. The FSB told &lt;em&gt;Interfax&lt;/em&gt; that it was acting at the request of US authorities and had informed them of the results of the operation. The operation effectively dismantled REvil as an entity, the FSB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MzfNS"&gt;The Biden administration has long &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/13/politics/white-house-ransomware-meeting/index.html"&gt;called on Russia to do more&lt;/a&gt; to crack down on ransomware gangs operating within the country, though with limited success until now. Analysts have tied Russian groups to extensive ransomware operations in Europe and the US, often without interference from local law enforcement. With no extradition treaty in place, the Russian government has been &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/11/russia-and-nearby-states-are-origin-of-most-ransomware-says-uk-cyber-chief"&gt;accused of sheltering cybercriminals&lt;/a&gt; provided they do not attack domestic targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulrtqD"&gt;US agencies have intensified their pursuit of REvil after the FBI linked it to the hack that shut down the Colonial Pipeline in May 2021. REvil was also behind a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;cyberattack against meat supplier JBS&lt;/a&gt;, also in May 2021, which shut down the company’s meat processing plants across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ealgdI"&gt;One alleged member of REvil was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770701/revil-ransomware-arrest-kaseya-crypto-europol-cybersecurity"&gt;arrested by Polish authorities&lt;/a&gt; in November 2021 after being indicted by the US. According to reporting in &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, a source close to the case said that the FSB would not hand over REvil group members with Russian citizenship to the United States after the latest arrests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTAFiC"&gt;The US Department of Justice had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKHSPX"&gt;The news of the operation against REvil comes on the same day that the government of Ukraine suffered a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883400/ukraine-government-websites-cyber-attack-russia"&gt;major cyber attack&lt;/a&gt;. Many government websites were disabled Friday morning, with spokespeople for both the Ukrainian government and the EU pointing the finger toward Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlW5IK"&gt;As the US continues to negotiate with Russia over its military activities on the Ukraine border, the FSB’s actions could be an offering linked to the talks, said Nina Jankowicz, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and specialist in Russian affairs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aveygx"&gt;“The FSB’s takedown of REvil might be Russia trying to throw the US a bone after negotiations on the mounting tensions on Ukraine’s border this week,” Jankowicz said. “But it doesn’t mean much when the rubber hits the road — Russia still has over 100,000 troops on the border and this morning, Ukraine’s government experienced a massive cyberattack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odd2MH"&gt;Though the Ukraine cyberattack has not yet been attributed to Russia, Jankowicz said, the mode of operation was similar to attacks carried out in advance of conflict in Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clean energy tech needs to be designed for recycling, experts say  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Wind energy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBOu-No5hJvUkNqUS303y_j3qZU=/0x124:5020x3471/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70388572/1237396065.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JeXA0B"&gt;Companies like Apple and Samsung aren’t the only ones making high-tech devices that are hard to take apart and recycle. So are the manufacturers of critical clean energy technologies like solar panels, wind turbines, and electric vehicle (EV) batteries — and unlike the consumer tech industry, which is &lt;a href="https://grist.org/technology/apple-finally-admits-its-products-are-difficult-to-repair/"&gt;slowly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;starting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787336/apple-right-to-repair-self-service-diy-reason-microsoft"&gt;to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22832895/dell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment"&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; some of its unsustainable design practices, there isn’t much being done about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ecafo"&gt;Batteries, solar panels, and wind turbines are all essential tools for combating climate change. However, these technologies take considerable energy and resources to make, and the best way to ensure we can keep making more of them sustainably is to recycle those resources at end of life. But today, clean energy recycling is limited by design choices that hinder disassembly, including the widespread use of ultra-strong adhesives. That could change, experts say, if the companies manufacturing supersized batteries for EVs and rare earth magnets for wind turbines shifted toward new adhesives that can be “de-bonded” using light, heat, magnetic fields, and more, or toward glue-free designs.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSfdHp"&gt;“Design for recycling hasn’t really come to that market yet,” says &lt;a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/chemistry/people/academic-staff/andrew_p_abbott"&gt;Andy Abbott&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of chemistry at the University of Leicester who recently co-authored a &lt;a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2021/gc/d1gc03306a"&gt;review paper&lt;/a&gt; on de-bondable adhesives and their potential use in clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvil54"&gt;Instead, Abbott says, manufacturers tend to “overengineer” their products for safety and durability. Take EV batteries, which are composed of anywhere from dozens to thousands of individual, hermetically-sealed cells glued together inside modules and packs. While the heavy use of adhesives helps ensure the batteries don’t fall apart on the road, it can make them incredibly difficult to take apart in order to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/a-recycling-renegade-is-out-of-prison-and-ready-to-tack-1840417556"&gt;repurpose individual cells&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fenvironment%2Farticle%2Felectric-vehicles-take-off-recycling-ev-batteries&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22882287%2Fclean-energy-tech-design-recycling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recycle critical metals&lt;/a&gt; like lithium, cobalt, and nickel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icRKiM"&gt;“At the moment, because everything is bonded together, lots of batteries end up getting shredded,” study co-author &lt;a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/physics/harper-gavin.aspx"&gt;Gavin Harper&lt;/a&gt;, an EV battery recycling expert at the University of Birmingham in the UK, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The material is mixed together, which makes subsequent steps in the recycling process more complicated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbyeAM"&gt;Solar panels and wind turbines are also designed for durability in ways that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/29/22857157/solar-recycling-new-better-method"&gt;make recycling challenging&lt;/a&gt;. Most solar panels are composed of silicon cells coated in layers of polymer sealants that bind the cells to weatherproof glass and plastic covers. While this electronic sandwich design means the panels can spend decades on a rooftop exposed to the elements, the adhesives and sealants used throughout the panel make it hard to separate the components cleanly at end of life. The rare earth magnets inside wind turbine generators, meanwhile, are coated in resins and glues that can create significant contamination for anyone looking to reclaim and reuse the material. A single wind turbine can contain &lt;a href="https://ewi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2-Major-Industrial-Uses-S.pdf"&gt;hundreds of pounds&lt;/a&gt; of rare earth elements, and demand for these metals is &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-019-0252-z"&gt;set to skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; as the world builds more EVs and more turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LljPPz"&gt;Abbott says manufacturers are just starting to wake up to the fact that recovering the critical materials inside clean energy technologies is important for shoring up long-term supplies — and that new design approaches are needed to facilitate that. “Really only in the last 18 months or so, that conversation has started to raise its head,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5dF3f"&gt;Abbott and Harper’s new paper lays out a number of potential paths toward a more recyclable clean tech sector. While solar manufactures are unlikely to eliminate adhesives any time soon, the authors suggest manufacturers could move toward adhesives and sealant materials that can be unstuck using chemicals, magnetic fields, or even a high-frequency sonic pulse. For wind turbine magnets, an adhesive that loses its stickiness in the presence of a strong magnetic field won’t work, but one that could be melted away using heat, or de-bonded when exposed to ultraviolet light, might be viable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwlWsR"&gt;Designs that use fewer adhesives could help improve EV battery recycling immensely. If batteries were easier to take apart down to the individual cells, Harper says it could make it easier to recover critical materials inside the cathode, including lithium, which is rarely recycled today. And at least one company is already commercializing an adhesive-free battery design: In 2020, Chinese battery manufacturer BYD announced a new “&lt;a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/byd-blade-battery-set-to-revolutionise-ev-market/"&gt;Blade Battery&lt;/a&gt;,” which features long, skinny cells that &lt;a href="https://www.dcbel.energy/2021/08/23/next-gen-batteries-leading-the-green-energy-charge/"&gt;clip into the main battery pack&lt;/a&gt; without the use of glue. “In terms of disassembly, it’s trivial,” Abbott says. “The cells just clip out.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnUuOS"&gt;For EV battery makers who don’t want to ditch glue-based designs, there are “a huge number of methods out there” that could lead to a more de-bondable adhesive, says Jenny Baker, a battery storage expert at Swansea University in the UK. The challenge, in her view, will be developing adhesives that can be unstuck quickly, in a process that can be done on an industrial scale.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ibEWJ5"&gt;“The thing is now to take some of the science and try and move it into the engineering side so that we can get it ready for really large-scale recycling because we know there’s going to be a lot of these batteries coming through,” Baker says. Based on &lt;a href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/24d5dfbb-a77a-4647-abcc-667867207f74/TheRoleofCriticalMineralsinCleanEnergyTransitions.pdf"&gt;projected growth&lt;/a&gt; in EV and energy storage markets, Harper &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fenvironment%2Farticle%2Felectric-vehicles-take-off-recycling-ev-batteries&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22882287%2Fclean-energy-tech-design-recycling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has estimated&lt;/a&gt; that by 2040, there could be about 8 million metric tons of battery waste in need of recycling around the world. A &lt;a href="https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2016/IRENA_IEAPVPS_End-of-Life_Solar_PV_Panels_2016.pdf"&gt;similar amount of solar e-waste&lt;/a&gt; could flood recycling plants by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylCPjd"&gt;To convince manufacturers (and consumers) to adopt more recycling-friendly adhesives and adhesive-free designs, Baker says they will need assurances that the alternatives don’t compromise product durability or lifespan, which in the clean tech sector is often measured in decades. She suspects that many new designs will have to be “road tested” in products with a shorter lifespan where premature failure is “less of a risk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MKF04"&gt;That could include consumer technology markets, where sustainability-oriented companies like Framework and Fairphone are already rolling out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22587205/framework-laptop-review"&gt;modular&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fairphone.com%2Fen%2F2020%2F01%2F17%2Fgoing-against-the-grain-to-design-a-sustainable-phone%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22882287%2Fclean-energy-tech-design-recycling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adhesive-free&lt;/a&gt; laptops and phones intended to be taken apart easily. Even industry titans like Apple and Dell have recently announced &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/behind-the-hype-of-apples-plan-to-end-mining-1833045476"&gt;ambitious goals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22832895/dell-luna-sustainable-laptop-concept-repairability-recyclable-environment"&gt;product concepts&lt;/a&gt; focused on recyclability. Abbott has already had preliminary talks with a phone manufacturer about glues that can de-bond a screen much more easily, although he says the company hasn’t yet embraced the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnC72m"&gt;Ultimately, manufacturers may be forced to overcome their reluctance to tweak product designs for recycling if policymakers start to mandate it or if the world faces shortages of the metals and minerals needed to build these technologies. As the clean energy transition causes &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-role-of-critical-minerals-in-clean-energy-transitions/mineral-requirements-for-clean-energy-transitions"&gt;demand for high-tech metals to spike&lt;/a&gt;, Baker says that companies are going to have to start getting more creative about where they source from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Dn6Cm"&gt;“If you can get [a resource] but it’s a really high price, that’s bad, but you can pass the price onto the consumer,” Baker says. “If you can’t get it at all, you have no business.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Wordle’s App Store clones, FTC’s Meta lawsuit moves forward, and PC’s big year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of a Wordle puzzle with “clone” in the answer field." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/425Wj8t0zT1jvV6S6-SUF_obVB0=/0x105:1125x855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70388487/IMG_3651.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C3th0l"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UC37hI"&gt;This week on&lt;em&gt; The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay Patel, Alex Cranz, and Russell Brandom start the show with news of federal judge James Boasberg allowing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878808/ftc-meta-facebook-lawsuit-ruling-revised-complaint-discovery"&gt;FTC to proceed with an antitrust lawsuit against Meta&lt;/a&gt;. The crew explains why the case can go forward after a dismissal last year and what can happen next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPlsY9"&gt;The next topic of discussion focuses on the viral success of the web-based puzzle game &lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;the race to clone it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; walks you through the drama, resulting in a bunch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle&lt;/em&gt; clones being removed from Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="la4Ys4"&gt;Later in the show,&lt;em&gt; Verge&lt;/em&gt; deputy editor Dan Seifert stops by for this week’s gadget talk.

    <title>These are the video game studios leading the charge for a four-day workweek</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qxIOECSVVEYMDiUqf7Tn7NP0EOU=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70388343/gute_fabrik_office.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration of Die Gute Fabrik’s studio space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some game companies are spearheading the idea that employees should work less rather than more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="gqJrQW"&gt;In January 2020, &lt;a href="http://stanleyparable.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the follow-up to 2011’s critically acclaimed first-person explorer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/17/4848072/free-will-is-overrated-the-stanley-parable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stanley Parable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, had already been delayed. In this situation, most bosses in the video game industry would consider crunch, industry parlance for predatory, often unpaid overtime. But William Pugh and his team at Berlin-based studio Crows Crows Crows implemented a solution that goes against conventional industry wisdom. Producer Alicia Contestabile raised the idea of a four-day week in 2019, and then, a few months later, office manager Filo Franke and artist and co-founder Dominik Johann revived it. “At this point, the question was really, ‘How do we keep going?’” Pugh recalls over a Discord call. “And we were basically Iike, ‘Okay, let’s just go to a four-day week.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fYZH5W"&gt;Prior to switching to a four-day week, &lt;a href="https://crowscrowscrows.com/"&gt;Crows Crows Crows&lt;/a&gt; was a regular nine-to-five, Monday-to-Friday organization; before that, it had been fully remote and operated a flexible working structure, paying employees for a certain number of hours per month because many of them were juggling multiple projects and clients. Pugh, a twenty-something with a background in theater who was only 19 when &lt;em&gt;The Stanley Parable&lt;/em&gt; became an indie smash hit, admits this initial transition to in-office work was tough. “I found going in five days a week straight up stressful,” he recalls. “I didn’t have a good work-life balance.” Pugh had &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/nov/04/microsoft-japan-four-day-work-week-productivity"&gt;read&lt;/a&gt; about Microsoft Japan’s trialing of a four-day week, which suggested that workers were not only happier but more productive. So he and the rest of the team at Crows Crows Crows, which has six full-time employees, made the leap because, as he puts it, “there was no real reason not to.” Contracts were rewritten — the same pay for four days’ work instead of five. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SArdSK"&gt;For years, stories about labor and workplace culture have made headlines in the video game industry for all the wrong reasons. &lt;a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/-ea-spouse-weblog-raises-issues-on-game-development-quality-of-life"&gt;Erin Hoffman&lt;/a&gt; lifted the lid on EA’s grim working hours in the early noughties, and since then, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494499/cyberpunk-2077-development-crunch-time-cd-projekt-red"&gt;crunch&lt;/a&gt; has remained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/20/17130056/telltale-games-developer-layoffs-toxic-video-game-industry"&gt;endemic within the industry&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412021002208#_blank"&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; of overwork’s harmful impacts on health and work quality. According to the latest &lt;a href="https://igda-website.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/18113901/IGDA-DSS-2021_SummaryReport_2021.pdf"&gt;IGDA developer satisfaction survey&lt;/a&gt;, crunch has only intensified since the pandemic began. Crows Crows Crows, alongside a growing number of independent studios — &lt;a href="https://gutefabrik.com/die-gute-fabriks-4-day-week/"&gt;Die Gute Fabrik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-09-09-young-horses-implements-four-day-weeks"&gt;Young Horses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/culture/q-a-kitfox-games-co-founder-tanya-x-short-breaks-down-the-four-day-week"&gt;Kitfox Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-03-armor-games-shares-four-day-workweek-findings"&gt;Armor Games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.ko-opmode.com/"&gt;Ko_Op Mode&lt;/a&gt; — plus, most eye-catchingly, &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714604/eidos-montreal-sherbrooke-four-day-week-game-development"&gt;Eidos-Montreal&lt;/a&gt; and its subsidiary Eidos-Sherbrooke are pushing back against such ingrained approaches to work. For all intents and purposes, these studios are putting people before product and profit. It is, says Pugh, about ensuring colleagues have space for their lives beyond the office — to “treat themselves with compassion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XMarlx91obEQVxsC3FMSAAZYqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167223/The_Stanley_Parable___Screenshot_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stanley Parable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v78q4h"&gt;By Pugh’s own admission, Crows Crows Crows, maker of decidedly experimental titles, is a “loose, chaotic kind of institution.” With such a focus on boundary-pushing work, he acknowledges it’s fallen into the trap of “valuing the product more than people.” The four-day week is a means of counteracting this, not least for Pugh’s own wellbeing as much as his colleagues. He mentions a mental health crisis that forced him to take time off and describes the four-day week as “literally life-saving.” With Fridays free, it allows Pugh to schedule therapy more easily, not having to tack it onto the start or end of a workday, which can leave him even more exhausted. While Pugh doesn’t have hard data on productivity, he feels work is more consistent across a four-day week. More than that, he says, “it just makes people happier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKVojb"&gt;Pugh’s anecdotal experience reflects scientific research. In Iceland, a trial run by Reykjavik City Council, which included over 2,500 workers (1 percent of Iceland’s working population), &lt;a href="https://en.alda.is/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/ICELAND_4DW.pdf"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that workers felt “less stressed and at risk of burnout” while their “work-life balance improved” after adopting a shorter working week. Importantly, workers also reported having “more time to spend with their families, do hobbies, and complete household chores.” According to researchers, productivity remained the same or improved, despite the reduction in hours from 40 to 35 or 36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LKii5xHsDJeHoH6WfKQsRzT_at4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23168582/1.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The team at Crows Crows Crows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Op5NyX"&gt;Where Pugh confesses that his management style at Crows Crows Crows is hands-off (“I’m not gonna put the thumbscrews in if I notice somebody clocking in on the Friday,” he says), Hannah Nicklin, lead of Copenhagen-based studio Die Gute Fabrik (German for “The Good Factory”), has devised a more &lt;a href="https://gutefabrik.com/die-gute-fabriks-4-day-week/"&gt;rigorous approach&lt;/a&gt; to the four-day week. She’s taken steps to make her 15-person team’s use of time more efficient, including working with other studios that might have already solved technical or design problems. (Nicklin, for example, prefers to pay to an external source for two hours’ worth of consultation rather than an employee for a week of research on precisely the same issue.) The company’s creative producer Ben Wilson has devised meeting templates for various aspects of production, taking care to ensure everyone is fully prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dB8rxm"&gt;“A lot of it is actually about project management,” explains Nicklin over Zoom, “so that’s it’s never like, ‘Oh, what’s this meeting for?’ We’re not just here to shout over one another for two hours while the quiet people in our team just sit there. It’s about working out what the best solutions are for us and our workforce.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dyJxu8"&gt;Nicklin, even more than Pugh, has an unconventional CV for a game studio boss — she also has a background in theater, has done stints in community arts, and is a longstanding labor activist. The phrase she repeats is “dignity of work,” a nod to both the political philosopher &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/09/contributive-justice-and-dignity-work/615919/"&gt;Michael J. Sandel&lt;/a&gt; and the late anthropologist &lt;a href="https://www.atlasofplaces.com/essays/on-the-phenomenon-of-bullshit-jobs/"&gt;David Graeber&lt;/a&gt;. In Nicklin’s view, respecting people’s time at their place of work is one part of this, and so is the four-day week itself. The other big initiative she’s introduced is a flat pay structure, which means she’s paid exactly the same as someone with a less senior role who’s been at the studio a similar amount of time. Where women, people of color, and other marginalized groups might undervalue themselves or indeed lack experience (or the bandwidth) for negotiation, this is an attempt to ensure fairer pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbmhCw"&gt;Nicklin acknowledges such changes would have been impossible without the support of her directors, who have bought into her workplace vision. “[Dignity of work] means empowering people and actively making space in the recruitment process and practice for a diverse workforce,” she continues. “There are people not thinking about that, who just think about the video game itself and don’t really care about who they burn through to get that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LiCx7sLzBaCQl2SKKm_ysKFlobE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23167231/ss_2639e2a47c9e80542afffda93555358a7d9aad6b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugsnax.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9LmCoz"&gt;Burning through staff is a major criticism frequently leveled at blockbuster game development. According to &lt;a href="https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/engaging-your-workforce/see-the-industries-with-the-highest-turnover%E2%80%94and-why-it-s-so-hi"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, the turnover rate in the games is around 15.5 percent, higher than any other tech sector, while burnout, exhaustion, and declining mental health are widely accepted as part and parcel of working for major game companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch"&gt;Bungie&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466"&gt;Rockstar&lt;/a&gt;. For Pugh, this is what happens when you have a passionate workforce who has had formative experiences with the games such capitalist organizations produce. “If your dream is to make games, then why wouldn’t you want to sacrifice to do that?” he says. “But so often, it’s just people sacrificing to make nicer rock textures or optimizing particle effects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuggJS"&gt;For AAA developers, dignity of work is even harder to come by. Over the past decade, roles have been atomized in organizations whose scale now resembles gigantic factories. Eidos-Montreal and Eidos-Sherbrooke moving to a four-day week is arguably the first step in reimagining worker wellbeing in the corporate mainstream of an industry that has too long treated it with contempt. (Both Quebec-based studios are under the corporate umbrella of Square Enix, which publishes everything from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;.) During the pandemic, both studios operated a policy of up to four hours “rest-time” on a Friday, which, according to one employee who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; anonymously over Zoom, was a means of “compensation” for the pandemic and the mental health toll it took. Then, on a company-wide Zoom meeting in fall 2021, Eidos-Montreal head David Anfossi announced the winding down of the “rest-time” program, replaced by the full four-day workweek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WscsE3"&gt;“It was kind of a rollercoaster,” reveals the Eidos employee. “We knew there was some talk of it because there were people looking at the research behind the whole thing, so it wasn’t a total surprise. But going from, ‘We’re looking into this,’ to, ‘We’re actively starting this,’ happened way faster than I thought it would.” Like Nicklin’s initiatives at Die Gute Fabrik, the Eidos studios are implementing smarter work structures, including certain hours of the week where meetings can’t be hosted and “focus time” designed to foster more productive working. These are ultimately measures intended to facilitate less “context switching” during the workday. “The changes make a lot of sense,” they say, “and should have just been done anyway.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Boyfriend Dungeon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikA7yNduoJk03nyriXXYPbHhOJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19585855/ss_9b01ee46580e814aa6ef43d431746b3ed85300c8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NJWV7X"&gt;Despite the Eidos studios making the transition, it’s with independent companies that the four-day week is gaining the greatest traction. However, even those who have made the switch remain cautious about its long-term feasibility. Kitfox Games made the change in June 2021 during the lead-up to the launch of its dating simulation dungeon-crawler &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22633028/boyfriend-dungeon-review-kitfox-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boyfriend Dungeon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea had been tossed around a few years earlier. At that stage, however, in the depths of development, co-founder Tanya Short felt it was simply “too risky” to add an “unknown percentage of inefficiency” to the studio’s work. “We’re probably not losing 20 percent. Lots of people aren’t super productive on Friday,” says Short. “But maybe they’re somewhat productive for the beginning of the day. Perhaps we’re losing 10 percent productivity or even 5 percent.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9YaiB"&gt;As co-founder of Kitfox Games, Short’s acutely aware of the pressures on independent video game studios and describes moving to the four-day week in terms of another “constraint” on their output. “On the one hand, it’s not that unusual a feeling to think, ‘Okay, this is just a new difficulty I have to operate under and a new consideration when I greenlight a product,” Short explains. “On the other hand, some part of me does wonder if I’m being irresponsible — if I’ll have to do layoffs or if I’m making these games too expensive to be maintainable. I guess we’ll find out in a few years whether this constraint was the straw that broke the camel’s back or if it was just another way for us to make games in a way that lets us also lead a good life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jKjoP"&gt;What hasn’t happened is any kind of pushback from the funders of these studios. Short describes Kitfox’s situation as enviable in the sense that the company only accepts funding from sources that trust it knows how best to make its games. “We don’t allow external scrutiny of our processes,” she says. Crows Crows Crows is self-financed, and Young Horses, developer of charming adventure game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/21551529/bugsnax-review-playstation-4-5-xbox-one-series-x-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bugsnax&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has cultivated an impressive level of financial independence, reliant on funding from Sony in only a “conservative way,” according to Kevin Geisler, COO and programmer at the company. For more precarious studios without the proven track record of these organizations, the four-day week may simply be less feasible. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgO4Kn"&gt;Still, this hasn’t stopped Contestabile, former producer at Crows Crows Crows, from implementing a four-day week at the as-yet-unnamed studio she’s in the process of setting up. Because it’s embedded into the company’s work structures from the very start, “it’s not like we’re losing a day,” she explains over email. That said, Contestabile envisages challenges related to the four-day week as production deepens but, conversely, a team that’s better placed to weather such difficulties — one “more resilient and well-rested.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2f99cB"&gt;For Contestabile, the four-day week isn’t just an opportunity to foster a healthier work culture — one that’s “fundamentally anti-racist, feminist, and LGBTQ+ friendly” — it’s also a way of making a meaningful contribution to the climate crisis. According to a recent &lt;a href="https://6a142ff6-85bd-4a7b-bb3b-476b07b8f08d.usrfiles.com/ugd/6a142f_5061c06b240e4776bf31dfac2543746b.pdf"&gt;UK report&lt;/a&gt;, moving to a four-day week can shrink carbon emissions, both by reducing energy use in the workplace and slashing transport emissions in the mornings and evenings. The report also found that giving people an extra day off meant they took part in more “low-carbon” activities, including rest, exercise, and seeing family. Eidos-Montreal and Eidos-Sherbrooke are already doing so at the scale of approximately 500 employees, and if more companies made the transition to a four-day week, it would represent genuine progress in reducing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21243285/video-games-climate-crisis-impact-xbox-playstation-developers"&gt;environmental impact&lt;/a&gt; of an industry reliant on electricity-intensive PCs and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvNjEJ"&gt;Like everything else, the pandemic has fundamentally reoriented the experience and expectations of work for many. It’s hardly a coincidence that the majority of studios that have transitioned to a four-day week have done so during it. But this is also another development in the longer-running story of labor in the video game industry, one that picked up even greater steam in 2021. The year was defined by worker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;walkouts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;strikes&lt;/a&gt;, and, momentously, the first North American video game union, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa"&gt;Vodeo Workers United&lt;/a&gt;. These were actions initiated by those attempting to secure greater dignity of work for both themselves and their co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Elka2W"&gt;“We have a lot of privilege as video game workers,” concludes Contestabile, “and I hope we all use that to make positive changes not only in our own workplaces but in our local communities and with sustainability in mind.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uWueQJ"&gt;Bollinger, a Michigan-based startup, announced today that it was postponing its plans to manufacture electric trucks in order to focus on commercial delivery vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHTM0W"&gt;Bollinger burst onto the scene several years ago with a pair of rugged, box-like electric truck prototypes: the four-door B1 (which is shaped like a Jeep Wrangler) and the B2 (which is longer and has a pickup bed). It’s the latest EV startup to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22846960/electric-vehicles-car-companies-promises-ship-dates"&gt;run into speed bumps&lt;/a&gt; as it attempts to build a complicated vehicle manufacturing business from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqOKC0"&gt;Bollinger has already delayed both vehicles, so their postponement may not come as a huge shock to close watchers. The trucks were originally scheduled to go into production in 2020, but that date was moved to late 2021, with the expectation of making several thousand by early 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KaPKLZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the latest EV startup to run into speed bumps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fv07gp"&gt;Now, the vehicles will be “postponed indefinitely” as the company shifts focus to an electric delivery van, Bollinger CEO Robert Bollinger said in a statement. The company will refund deposits for those customers who previously put money down to reserve the B1 and B2 trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1R98r"&gt;“The B1 and B2 are postponed indefinitely, in order to concentrate on commercial development,” he said. “As these trucks are dear to my heart, I’d never say never. If our continued development in commercial allows us to someday return, there’d be no one happier than me. But there’s no timeline for that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Xd9sL"&gt;The Deliver-E electric van, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405451/bollinger-electric-delivery-van-production-price-specs"&gt;which was announced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, is slated to be built on a variable vehicle platform that allows for multiple battery sizes, such as 70 kWh, 105 kWh, 140 kWh, 175 kWh, and 210 kWh. This will mean customers will have a variety of range options, prices, and wheelbase sizes to choose from. The front-wheel-drive platform will be engineered to fit Classes 2B, 3, 4, and 5. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HyTeWj0lW4skUtIodMh9aH-HoSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23166646/Bollinger_Motors_Electric_Platform_front_3.4.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcPd7L"&gt;Bollinger declined to affirm a starting date for the van’s production, noting that the company is still on the hunt for a manufacturing partner. “The Deliver-E van was our interpretation of the kind of body that could be put on our electric platforms,” he said. “We never intended on building that body ourselves, but we are in talks with upfitter partners now that manufacture truck and van bodies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ex7YD"&gt;If it eventually graduates from concept to production, the Deliver-E will have a lot of competition. General Motors is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867087/walmart-brightdrop-electric-delivery-van-gm-fedex"&gt;shipping electric vans&lt;/a&gt; under its BrightDrop brand to customers like FedEx and Walmart. Mercedes-Benz has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173373/mercedes-benz-evito-electric-van-specs-photos"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251084/mercedes-benz-eqv-electric-van-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; on the road, and Ford plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;go into production&lt;/a&gt; this year on its electrified E-Transit van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpCx9Y"&gt;Amazon, which has a fleet of tens of thousands of combustion-engine vans making up its massive delivery operation, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873947/amazon-electric-delivery-van-rivian-jeff-bezos-order"&gt;ordered 100,000 electric vans from EV startup Rivian&lt;/a&gt; (which it is also heavily invested in) and is planning on buying EVs from Stellantis as well. &lt;/p&gt;
