    <title>Binance is facing an unconventional new legal claim over May 19th outage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOgyRn"&gt;A group of disgruntled investors is pursuing a formal claim against the cryptocurrency platform Binance for allegedly causing millions in damages through an unanticipated outage earlier this year. Filed in an international business arbitration court, the case represents the largest investor action ever brought against a cryptocurrency platform, and a major test of the rights of investors speculating in digital currency markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sWawv"&gt;The case stems from &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/05/19/coinbase-binance-outage-crypto-bitcoin-crash/"&gt;a widespread service outage on May 19th&lt;/a&gt;, which coincided with a massive drop in the price of Bitcoin. Binance wasn’t the only platform affected, as a mass selloff clogged blockchain transactions and overwhelmed reserves, but the complex financial products offered by the platform made the damage particularly severe. By the time service had been restored, many futures and leverage traders on Binance had seen their entire accounts automatically emptied. The traders say that, if Binance had been capable of filling orders, they could have sold off before their holdings became worthless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmEQHY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Binance does not have a listed headquarters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CcmlW3"&gt;More than 700 people were affected by the freeze, and early participants in the new action include losses as large as $12 million. If the action is successful, Binance will have to make up those losses out of its own pocket, and accept a higher level of liability to investor claims going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGLgxR"&gt;One participant in the new action, a Canadian investor named Fawaz, says he attempted to close his position as early as noon on May 19th — but the platform failure made it impossible. “I tried to click that Close Position button more than 70 times,” Fawaz said in a statement provided to reporters. “But it never worked. Eventually, my position got fully liquidated.” All told, he believes he lost $6 million because of the downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="w8c1TM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In no jurisdiction would this ever be allowed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kykekd"&gt;Binance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S9sIdg"&gt;Simply finding a venue to hear the case was a challenge. Binance does not have a listed headquarters that could place it in a specific jurisdiction, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573812/binance-crash-cryptocurrency-regulation-lawsuit"&gt;frustrated earlier attempts to file a traditional lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company’s terms of service request that all legal proceedings be handled through the &lt;a href="https://www.hkiac.org/"&gt;Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre&lt;/a&gt;, a quasi-judicial body typically used to resolve transnational business disputes. The plaintiffs are hoping to bundle everyone affected by Binance outages into a single arbitration suit, minimizing court costs and giving investors like Fawaz their first shot at getting some of their money back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qme4KN"&gt;“In no jurisdiction would this ever be allowed,” says David Kay, who is financing the action through his Liti Capital fund. “But they’re not subject to any jurisdiction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FNcHw"&gt;Kay and his partners have already assembled a steering committee, led by a handful of plaintiffs affected by the outage including Fawaz. But they’re hoping to attract more before taking the claim to Hong Kong, and encouraging anyone affected by a Binance outage to join the case &lt;a href="https://liticapital.com/binanceclaim/"&gt;through their website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2Ya2E"&gt;Most notorious for &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/womens-rights/womens-rights-workplace/its-time-end-forced-arbitration"&gt;their role in US employment law&lt;/a&gt;, arbitration hearings differ from traditional trials in important ways. The investors’ action is not technically a lawsuit, and the concept of a “class action” is not applicable. Without a national body of law, arbitrators rely on international standards for business practice. Without a government upholding the system, the parties expected to bear significant costs for initiating proceedings, although the specifics of the costs can vary. But similar to conventional courts, the final ruling is binding, and the Hong Kong Arbitration Centre has significant powers to enforce payment if the investors’ claim is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pk2oSC"&gt;Founded in 2017, Binance has been wildly successful as a cryptocurrency platform, growing into the primary venue for more complex financial trading in cryptocurrency markets. The platform claims to process &lt;a href="https://www.binance.com/en/about"&gt;more than a million trades each second&lt;/a&gt;, generating billions of dollars in user fees. That success has come with significant regulatory issues. The platform is currently under investigation from &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/doj-irs-investigating-crypto-exchange-binance-report"&gt;both the US Department of Justice and Internal Revenue Service&lt;/a&gt;, and has been &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/binance-uk-crackdown-boosts-rival-cryptocurrency-exchanges.html"&gt;formally blocked from operating in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJWOl9"&gt;The recent action is unconventional in a number of ways, not least in how the plaintiffs are organizing their case. The case is being financed by Kay’s Liti Capital, which will assume the significant upfront costs for mounting the lawsuit. In exchange, the firm will receive a portion of any resulting settlement, similar to the contingency rate offered by plaintiff’s lawyers in the US. In a crypto-oriented twist, Liti is itself &lt;a href="https://liticapital.com/about-us/"&gt;funded through a tokenized blockchain system&lt;/a&gt;, allowing more flexibility as investors seek to finance specific legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="le0yDQ"&gt;There’s a certain irony to using a blockchain-traded litigation firm to mount a lawsuit against a major cryptocurrency platform, but as Kay sees it, it’s all for the greater good of the blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DETdoD"&gt;“I want Binance to be successful,” says Kay. “I want the crypto industry to be successful. But we have to set some basic rules.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: flipping into the mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Third time is maybe the charm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="CaJyux"&gt;The story of folding phones thus far has been one of compromise. Choosing a folding phone over a standard slab design has generally meant you compromised on performance, durability, and most of all, price. They’ve been the domain of early adopters, the people willing to put up with those compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6JkBO"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip 3 is the first folding phone to challenge all that. It has the same processor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 released earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen runs at a smooth 120Hz, just like Samsung’s other flagships. It has a new, allegedly more durable construction, plus IP water resistance, just like you’d expect on a modern phone. And most importantly, its starting price is $1,000, $450 less than the launch price of the Z Flip 5G it replaces. That puts the Flip 3 on the same price level as many high-end, non-folding phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpD4D5"&gt;The Flip 3 isn’t necessarily a sure bet, though. There are things it’s not as good at as other, standard phones. Using a folding phone like this is a different experience than many of us are used to. But increasingly, those differences boil down to personal preferences and choices, not compromises. And that means this is the first folding phone that can appeal to mainstream phone buyers, not just early adopters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="O4Rqre"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10708004"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OREo3N"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AAOtj_R1-bXv-TGUBnmLE_Gtu5g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790768/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s design is very similar to the earlier versions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nLiS6W"&gt;The design of the Flip 3 is largely the same as the first Galaxy Flip and the Flip 5G that both came out last year. The goal of this folding phone is not to turn a normal-sized phone into a tablet, like the Galaxy Fold series, but go the opposite direction: turn a large phone into something that fits easier in your pocket or purse. When closed, the Flip 3 is roughly the size of my wallet, but open it up and you’ve got a spacious, though tall, 6.7-inch screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJePdD"&gt;Also like the earlier Flips, the Flip 3 is rather thick when it’s closed — it’s effectively twice the thickness of normal phones. But that didn’t make it hard to handle or slide into my pocket. Since the Flip 3 is only half as tall as other phones, there’s no concern of it poking out the top of my pants pocket. If anything, it stayed in my pants and jacket pockets &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; than tall, thin phones — I never was concerned about it sliding out when I sat down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6O9Kq"&gt;The Flip 3’s hinge is mostly unchanged from last time — it’s still quite stiff and difficult to flick open with one hand, though satisfying to snap shut. (Samsung recommends using two hands to open the phone.) It can be positioned halfway open and stay there, so you can prop the phone up and take selfies, make a video call, or watch a video using only half the display. I never did this and don’t suspect many people outside of Samsung’s marketing materials would either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lZUkZvRj8QPuTjkjFi5r289Ly1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790758/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The hinge design is largely unchanged, but Samsung is using a new lubricant and aluminum alloy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvA0HvTSiaY1G8slJ2HGNcr8mfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790756/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3 is about as thick as two phones when closed and yes, there’s still a slight gap when it’s closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGbP2M"&gt;Most of the durability improvements Samsung made are under the hood, including self-curing gaskets to keep out water. You can read about those changes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;more detail in my colleague Dieter Bohn’s piece&lt;/a&gt;, but the takeaway is this: you don’t have to worry about getting the Flip 3 wet, which is quite an accomplishment for a delicate piece of electronics that literally folds in half. You do still have to be conscious of dust and debris — the Flip 3 has no official dust protection rating — and there’s still a visible gap in the hinge when it’s closed. TL;DR: the Flip 3 is good for the pool, not for the beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfnZ5V"&gt;Otherwise, the fit and finish of the Flip 3 is on par with other flagship phones. The cream-colored review unit I have has a unique retro appeal, and its aluminum side rails and hinge have a soft, matte finish to them. (Samsung’s also providing a variety of other color options if cream isn’t your thing.) It doesn’t creak or grind disconcertingly when you open or close it, and the seams and tolerances are nice and tight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EC-gGx42ewCVd9PT6Voq6ODfxNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790754/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cover screen is four times larger than before, but it’s still too small to do most things.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wannr1"&gt;The big, visible change Samsung made with the Flip 3 is increasing the size of the cover screen from a scant 1.1 inches out to 1.9 inches (measured diagonally), which translates to a roughly four times larger display. It’s much more useful for checking notifications and controlling media than the miniscule ticker screen on the prior Flips, but it’s still quite limited. Though the interface mimics a smartwatch, including swipeable panels for calendar appointments, weather, alarms, and timers, you can’t reply to an incoming message without using Bixby voice commands (no thanks) or opening up the phone fully. You can use the screen to frame up selfies, and the clock is customizable with different animations, but the cover screen itself could stand to be quite a bit larger still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDfqOe"&gt;The cover screen’s limitations highlight how using the Flip 3 is different from a standard smartphone. You can’t just pick the Flip up and quickly do what you want one-handed — you almost always have to open the phone up, which often requires two hands. It’s less convenient than a standard phone and takes longer to do simple tasks because of this. I got around these limitations by just leaving the Flip open and treating it like a normal phone when I’m sitting at my desk or just hanging around the house, only bothering to close it when I wanted to put it in my pocket. But that largely defeats the reason you’d buy a folding phone in this style to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OYU8hW"&gt;Samsung has a suite of colorful and fun cases for the Flip 3 that include built-in finger straps or rings to make it easier to hold the phone when it’s open. I got to try one of the strappy models and while the neon colors looked great and it was like having a built-in PopSocket on the phone, it doesn’t make it any easier to get the Flip 3 open with one hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uZpEft"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 display&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Uzk3pFkgD3Bs-_Ipt1hYZj9kws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790770/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Z Flip 3’s display has all of the specs for a top-tier phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YErFFb"&gt;Once the Flip 3 is open, you’re treated to a 6.7-inch, 1080 pixel wide OLED display that gets brighter and has a faster refresh rate than the prior models. It looks and feels just as nice as Samsung’s other OLED screens, with fast touch response, punchy colors, deep blacks, and smooth scrolling. It’s easy to see outdoors, looks great when watching video, and is right up there in performance and quality compared to other flagship phones. The Flip 3’s 9:22 aspect ratio is taller than most phones, but other than that, it works just like any other modern smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmUONa"&gt;On top of that upgraded display is a new factory-installed screen protector that’s made from a harder material than what Samsung used in the past. It’s much more difficult to dent or scratch than the old Flip’s gummy-feeling screen protector, and it feels much nicer to tap and swipe on. It’s basically indistinguishable in feel from the screen protectors many people put on top of normal phones and Samsung says it should last longer and bubble less than the old one. (In my week or so of testing I haven’t seen any bubbles form.) The company still does not recommend you remove the screen protector and if you need to get it replaced, it expects you to go to a certified repair center to have a new one installed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n5IPY3HprDoL0NxlX7g8SH1jY5U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790740/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you look for the crease, you will see it, but it’s not a problem in normal use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o0fGda"&gt;You can still feel the crease in the center of the screen and if you look at the phone from an oblique angle, you can absolutely see it. But it never got in the way of actually using the phone and after a day or two, I just forgot about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YJhqG"&gt;Despite Samsung’s claims of improved durability with last year’s Flip phones, a disconcertingly large number of them still &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mgAKSnMH0s"&gt;cracked right at the crease&lt;/a&gt;, even if they weren’t dropped or damaged. Samsung is putting a lot of weight on how it rearranged the screen’s layers to make them more durable this time around and claims the new screen protector makes the screen 80 percent stronger than before. The company is also giving away a year of its $12.99 per month extended warranty to those who preorder the Flip 3, which lets you get the screen fixed for a $249 fee. But I can understand why you might want to wait a few months and see how things shake out with the Flip 3’s screen durability before taking the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xaH9V2"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ULyMLN"&gt;The Galaxy Flip 3 has the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM as the Galaxy S21, and its performance is as quick and snappy as any other flagship phone released this year. It’s also fully compatible with all of the 5G flavors available in the US, including the still-rare-but-fast-if-you-can-find-it millimeter wave networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1Ff263"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Performance and battery life are right in line with what you’d expect from a flagship phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mA4tpB"&gt;Battery life is also just fine, providing between four and five hours of screentime between charges. That’s enough to last me a full day without concern and the wireless charging makes it easy to top up the battery on my nightstand or when I’m at my desk. You can get phones that last longer between charges, but most people won’t have a problem with the Flip 3’s stamina. One note: the Flip 3, like many other high-end phones released in the past couple of years, does not come with a charging brick in the box. It supports up to 25W fast charging, but you’ll have to BYOB (bring your own brick).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyLBeM"&gt;New for the Flip 3 is a set of stereo speakers, a noticeable upgrade over the mono speaker on the older Flips. The new speakers are much louder and make watching video more enjoyable, though I noticed the earpiece speaker was noticeably louder than the bottom speaker when I watched YouTube, as if the stereo balance was shifted. That could be because the speaker is facing directly at me, while the bottom speaker fires off to the side, but Samsung wasn’t able to immediately explain it when I asked. Still not available is a headphone jack, so you’d better like those speakers or use Bluetooth headphones with the Flip 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdjPP8"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rnZ1xtoE1DTQTp5_g40ehw9JnEA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790746/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s cameras have the same specs as last year’s models and don’t quite hang with the best camera phones available now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQZiHa"&gt;Perhaps the area where Samsung made the least forward progress is with the Flip 3’s camera array. The 12-megapixel standard wide and ultrawide rear cameras and the 10-megapixel front-facing selfie camera have the same specs and lenses as last year’s Flip 5G. It’s an area where you are required to make different choices about your priorities compared to standard flagship phones that have more capable or versatile camera systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qtlAP"&gt;That isn’t to say the Flip 3’s cameras are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, it’s just that if camera quality or features are the primary concerns for you in a phone, it’s not the best one to choose. Pictures from any of the cameras are characteristically Samsung, with vibrant, almost oversaturated colors, lots of sharpening, and noticeable smoothing of faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qUaBjd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708526"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJeV99"&gt;The results are images that many people will find pleasing and want to share right away, without making many edits or adjustments or zooming in to compare fine details. The Flip 3 is not as good in low light as an iPhone 12 Pro Max or Pixel 5, nor does it have the versatility of the Samsung S21 Ultra’s long telephoto lens. But for everyday snaps and casual picture taking, the Flip 3 is plenty capable. Plus, you can use the cover screen to frame selfies with the main cameras, though it’s still too small for me to do that comfortably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BIgrdQ"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3 software and other stuff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJk7Y2"&gt;The rest of the Flip 3’s story is typical Samsung. It’s running Android 11 with Samsung’s OneUI interface on top of it. It’s fine, if a bit cluttered, and Samsung is still using its stock apps as places to jam unwanted ads, which is gross and annoying. (At least, at launch there will be ads. Samsung says it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630332/samsung-ads-default-stock-apps-weather-pay-theme-confirmed"&gt;removing them later this year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fvxLle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Once it’s open, the Z Flip 3 is just like any other Samsung&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GjPvwR"&gt;Unlike the Fold line of phones, the Flip 3 isn’t trying to replace a tablet or come up with any new multitasking paradigms, and it doesn’t have any issue displaying popular apps like Instagram. Once it’s open, it basically just works like any other Samsung phone, complete with Samsung’s app store, browser, mobile payments, notes app, health app, and more. Samsung has committed to delivering four years of security updates and three generations of new Android platform updates on its phones, which means your folding phone’s software support might last longer than its screen does.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flip 3’s entire appeal is being a big phone that fits easily in a pocket or purse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CuzRNb"&gt;The original Galaxy Z Flip showed that a folding phone can feel like a normal phone, once you get over its wow factor. It can be the kind of thing that you just get used to day in and day out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ds6N79"&gt;The Z Flip 3 is Samsung applying its relentless iteration to that idea and making it something that &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a normal phone, right down to the price it charges for it. Samsung has systematically checked off the boxes that made earlier Flip models purely curiosities: performance, features, price, and durability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6kR0R9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Z Flip 3 is the first foldable that’s also a normal phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JS0SoR"&gt;I don’t think the Flip 3 is for everyone — there are still people out there who want the absolute best camera or aren’t intrigued by the idea of what the Flip offers. And how well its improved durability holds up over the long term is still an open question. But it’s the first folding phone where I can see a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of people choosing it, particularly when it’s the same cost as a phone that looks the same as what they’ve been using for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oCGGRt"&gt;Just a few years ago, it seemed like folding phones were just a futuristic experiment. With the Z Flip 3, the second phase of the experiment begins, the one where we find out if folding phones can appeal to more than just early adopters. It’s an important proving ground for the concept and fortunately the Z Flip 3 appears up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ghost of Tsushima’s purring cats might be my favorite PS5 feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v5xGyKpFTNDhRxtsSeD4RiFLlxY=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746621/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20210818135640.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1g0Jn2"&gt;Since the PlayStation 5 debuted, we’ve seen lots of novel uses of its DualSense controller. Game developers have utilized the haptic vibrations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549072/astros-playroom-ps5-review-dualsense-controller"&gt;to simulate weather like falling rain or blowing wind&lt;/a&gt;, while the added resistance in the triggers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;makes firing a weapon or making an exhausted NBA star sprint all the more immersive&lt;/a&gt;. Often these features help make seemingly small interactions feel more notable — and my favorite new example is the cats in &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/em&gt; on the PS5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKFu6D"&gt;The new version isn’t really a director’s cut, at least in the typical sense, but rather an enhanced version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"&gt;the open-world samurai game&lt;/a&gt; that originally launched as the last big PS4 exclusive in 2020. That game married a fairly standard open-world structure with unique samurai elements, like involved sword fighting and the ability to soak in a hot spring or find a quiet spot to write a haiku. The director’s cut, meanwhile, is both a next-gen update and an expansion of that original game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wv97nV"&gt;In terms of the expansion, there’s a whole new region, called Iki island, that features its own storyline that’s pretty distinct from the main campaign. Protagonist Jin Sakai learns of a sort of hallucinogenic poison being used on Tsushima and tracks its source down to a cult-like group, led by a woman known simply as Eagle, on Iki. In order to protect his homeland he sets out to the island to stop Eagle altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uH4yOc"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc4_dXjkCl8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNQJF2"&gt;Iki is much smaller than Tsushima, and the expansion also has a much darker tone than the base game. Things start out rough: Jin’s boat encounters some bad weather, and he washes up on shore completely alone. Eventually he joins forces with a group of raiders who have been ravaged by Eagle’s forces. There’s lots of death and drama, and the challenge has also been ramped up a bit — I keep finding myself dying a lot more than usual (though that may have to do with the long layoff between now and having played the original version last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tBCyc1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Ghost of Tsushima is a beautiful samurai tale buried under a familiar open-world game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9z41B9"&gt;Outside of the new location and quest line, as well as the standard next-gen upgrades like improved visuals and performance (you can, as with most PS5 games, choose between “higher resolution” and “better frame rate”), there are also a handful of new gameplay features. Shaman enemies are able to strengthen other fighters, adding a nice layer of strategy to combat, and you can also unlock additional exploration skills for finding specific locations. It’s here that the most important addition comes into play: animal sanctuaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEPk3A"&gt;Iki island feels much more alive than Tsushima, with a greater variety of wildlife. When I first arrived, there were monkeys hanging out on the beach, and as I moved deeper into the island, I discovered new locations where cats just kind of hang around, lazing in the grass. The first time you find a sanctuary you have to earn those cats’ trust by playing the flute, which you do by moving the controller up and down, utilizing the DualSense’s motion-sensing feature to keep in tune. Once that’s sorted, you can walk up to any cat and press the right trigger to pet them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-T7VU7WRbbmcNsFlfhqIebKuP3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22790846/Ghost_of_Tsushima_20210818140042.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PN0Stx"&gt;What follows is an adorable animation where a cat slowly walks up to Jin, sniffs, nuzzles his hand, and then gives him a playful bite on the wrist. The whole while, the DualSense does a remarkable job of replicating the unmistakable feel of a purr through the controller’s vibrations. (It’s also a great place to play around with the game’s photo mode, where you can really zoom in to see the details; when it’s windy, you can even see the cat’s fur blowing around.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHAxoV"&gt;Part of what makes &lt;em&gt;Ghost&lt;/em&gt; so distinct is the way it balances brutal, bloody combat with quieter, more reflective moments. These new sanctuaries lean into this idea even more. They’re not exactly vital, and you could probably experience the new storyline without even interacting with them. But, a few hours in, they’ve been the most memorable part of the expansion for me so far — there are few better ways to unwind after a violent conflict than with a cat purring in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojE86O"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches August 20th on the PS5.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil’s upcoming Wear OS smartwatch leaks with Snapdragon 4100 Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VC0jv4LrCJPoRtwaAburEShrUf8=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746604/ezgif_6_c24c8ad20bec.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qXHst6"&gt;Fossil’s upcoming Gen 6 smartwatch has leaked thanks to a retailer listing &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it appears to be Fossil’s first smartwatch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21307368/qualcomm-snapdragon-4100-google-wear-os-smartwatch-wearables-faster-battery-life"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 4100 Plus processor&lt;/a&gt;, which launched last year but has so far only appeared on a handful of devices. The new watch follows Fossil’s Gen 5 lineup, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835364/fossil-wear-os-smartwatch-android-gen-5-review-price-specs-features"&gt;dates back to 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and received &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223834/fossil-gen-5-lte-smartwatch-announcement-skagen-michael-kors"&gt;new LTE-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiG2Ij"&gt;The Gen 6 will be Fossil’s first Wear OS smartwatch since Google announced it was collaborating with Samsung on the third-generation of its operating system. But based on currently available information, the wearable is unlikely to launch with the new software. When Google announced its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/wearos/thread/118166873/what-wear-os-3-means-for-you?hl=en-GB"&gt;Wear OS 3 update plans in July&lt;/a&gt; it said that Fossil’s upcoming devices will be among those to receive a Wear OS 3 update in the “mid to second half of 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,124696.html" target="_blank"&gt;WinFuture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right there appear to be two buttons and a rotating crown.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AR7vQi"&gt;In terms of specs, &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the Gen 6 smartwatch comes with a 1.28-inch 416x416 circular OLED display, and should be available in 42mm and 44mm case sizes with a variety of straps including leather, fabric, and metal versions. The leak suggests there’s 8GB of internal storage, 24 hours of battery life, GPS, and heart rate, blood oxygen, and fitness tracking features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k9J3pF"&gt;Fossil’s Gen 6 smartwatch appears to be going on sale on September 27th, when it looks set to cost €299 (around $350) or €329 (around $385), according to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside Facebook’s metaverse for work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lz8RLdK_0_-uV1dmer4yVvmWKgs=/135x0:1547x941/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746469/Screen_Shot_2021_08_18_at_5.37.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook is bringing the office to VR with Horizon Workrooms&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XoPD9c"&gt;It wasn’t long into a recent press briefing I attended in virtual reality when Mark Zuckerberg showed up to talk about the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaltvD"&gt;I was sitting at a long, U-shaped conference table with a handful of other reporters, our floating torsos bobbing over our chairs, as the Facebook CEO beamed in. A giant, floating display nearby showed other Facebook employees dialed in from the non-VR world to watch us through their computer screens. It was there that Zuckerberg first appeared through his webcam before donning a headset and teleporting into a chair at the table as his own legless avatar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JDji4"&gt;We were there to preview a new app, which Facebook is describing as an “open beta,” for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest&lt;/a&gt; called Horizon Workrooms. It’s the social network’s first stab at creating a VR experience specifically for people to work together in. After spending over an hour in Workrooms, I can see its potential as a more immersive way to communicate with people who are physically apart, but I don’t see it catching on beyond the most diehard VR enthusiasts anytime soon. That said, I can see this experience become compelling for more casual users, and potentially those who are totally new to VR, in the years ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mG7ik4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10708748"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWKeRq"&gt;While an incremental update to Facebook’s VR efforts in its own right, Workrooms fits into the social network’s broader ambitions to own the next computing platform and build the so-called metaverse. Zuckerberg went so far as to recently say he wants Facebook to be primarily thought of as a metaverse company—a sci-fi concept that says we will all one day spend significant chunks of time in a fully immersive, digital space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Or as Zuckerberg puts it, an “embodied internet.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BHsoS"&gt;What impressed me the most about Workrooms is the way that it brings parts of the outside world into VR. Up to 16 people in VR can be in a Workroom together, while an additional 34 people can join over video call without wearing a headset. A companion desktop app lets you beam a live feed of your computer screen over your virtual table space. Thanks to the Quest’s hand-tracking and front-facing cameras, a virtual representation of your physical keyboard sits underneath your screen for typing into a barebones web app Facebook built for note taking and managing calendars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="GAAzCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="T6Oh09"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Boz|103541" data-volume-uuid="8ecab1579" data-volume-id="103541" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-96" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Facebook Reality Labs VP&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kcY2Ks"&gt;“I think it might be the most intense VR application that exists, in terms of how much we’re trying to put every bell and whistle from the headset into the experience you’re using,” Facebook’s top AR/VR executive, Andrew Bosworth, told us during the briefing, which was the first of its kind I’ve experienced entirely in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VphqRk"&gt;For now, the process of getting into Workrooms initially is quite clunky. It oddly requires creating a separate Workrooms account through the web, downloading Workrooms in Oculus, and then pairing your headset to your Workrooms account by entering a code shown in the headset on your computer’s web browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AK8gd7"&gt;Some features in Workrooms, like a personal drawing pad and giant whiteboard that anyone can go up to and use, feel more gimmicky than useful. There were multiple times when the audio cut out or became garbled, and the Quest’s hand tracking isn’t perfect. At one point Zuckerberg had to leave and rejoin the room because his avatar’s mouth wasn’t moving at all when he spoke. The desktop companion app isn’t yet compatible with Apple’s M1 processor, so I wasn’t able to try it on my 2020 MacBook Air. (A Facebook rep told me support is coming soon for Apple M1 computers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4atMns"&gt;Even with the bugs and relatively scaled-back graphics of the Quest compared to my MacBook screen, I still felt more present in Workrooms than I normally do in a traditional video conferencing setup like Zoom. Native arm and hand tracking, down to the movements of individual fingers, certainly helped. A larger factor is the Quest’s spatial audio. When someone talked in one corner of the room, it sounded like their voice was coming from that direction. At one point the seating chart was changed and I felt as if someone sitting behind me in VR was actually speaking from behind my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jbuI7J"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="snudvu"&gt;Facebook has been using Workrooms internally for meetings for about six months, according to Zuckerberg. “These kinds of experiences, where you can actually feel present with other people, are I think a much richer way to interact than the types of social apps we’ve been able to build on phones or computers,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="bqGw22"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Facebook Horizon: Zuckerberg|103542" data-volume-uuid="5fa2b9791" data-volume-id="103542" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-808" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg during a meeting in Horizon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pex3iP"&gt;Zuckerberg is right that VR feels more immersive than a phone or computer screen. But Workrooms — and the hardware that powers it — has a ways to go before it will be compelling enough to replace existing ways people work together and hang out at scale. But at the rate that Facebook’s Oculus hardware and software have been progressing, I expect experiences like Workrooms to be much more accessible and enticing in a couple of years than they are now. Other coming entrants into the space, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;such as Apple&lt;/a&gt;, will likely accelerate consumer interest in these sorts of headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNH9J1"&gt;Workrooms is part of a bigger umbrella project Facebook is building for Oculus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405249/facebook-vr-space-horizon-access-public-beta"&gt;called Horizon&lt;/a&gt;. Originally teased a couple of years ago, Horizon aims to essentially be the full Facebook universe — a metaverse, you could say — for virtual reality. Workrooms will be part of it, and Facebook has in the past demoed games and world-building tools similar to Minecraft or Roblox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeNrqS"&gt;Despite originally saying Horizon would debut in 2020, the experience remains in invite-only beta, and Facebook’s Bosworth declined to give me an exact timeframe for when that would change. He said the company has been focused on building more tools for creators, so they in turn can build things in Horizon for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji0xWm"&gt;That indicates Facebook wants Horizon to be a platform for other developers to build upon. Until Horizon comes out, Workrooms is the best glimpse yet at what Facebook means when it says it’s building the metaverse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DTS’s Play-Fi multiroom audio platform is getting a big home theater upgrade  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d39Ig4yF2r4vkxNxLdLWnLzg5y4=/108x0:747x426/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746381/news_main_image_play_fi_home_theater_854_426_90_s_c1_smart_scale.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: DTS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0OhAR"&gt;Play-Fi, the multiroom audio platform from DTS, is getting a home theater upgrade with &lt;a href="https://play-fi.com/news/introducing-dts-play-fi-home-theater"&gt;Play-Fi Home Theater&lt;/a&gt;, a new set of wireless audio features designed to cut down on the amount of cables needed when using a TV with external speakers. Play-Fi Home Theater works using a TV’s built-in Wi-Fi with “no adapters, no dongles, and no add-on boxes” according to DTS, and is launching with as-yet unnamed TVs in the third quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWLsaA"&gt;DTS’s Play-Fi standard has been around for close to a decade, and is designed to let you build up a multiroom audio setup using speakers and other components from different manufacturers. That’s in contrast to systems like Sonos, which only streams to Sonos-branded equipment. The standard can already be used to pair Play-Fi wireless speakers to &lt;a href="https://play-fi.com/faq/entry/set-up-play-fi-surround"&gt;use as surrounds with a Play-Fi soundbar&lt;/a&gt;, but now compatible TVs will support a wider range of setups natively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IpsGFx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Including support for up to two subwoofers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="15qtLg"&gt;According to DTS, Play-Fi Home Theatre-enabled TVs will be able to wirelessly output audio to a Play-Fi soundbar, or to wireless speakers to use as front or surround channels. There’s also support for up to two wireless subwoofers, or the option to use your TV’s built-in speakers as part of a surround sound setup. The latter case might end up sounding a little odd given the huge disparity in quality between the built-in audio in most TVs compared to standalone speakers, but it could work as a compromise as you build up a setup over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUfQCF"&gt;“Consumers no longer need to compromise aesthetics for an improved audio experience,” says DTS Play-Fi’s general manager Dannie Lau, “They can attain better sound quality simply by using a wireless subwoofer placed out of sight or build a high-performance home theater using a full complement of wireless speakers and subwoofers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSJZB9"&gt;DTS says Play-Fi already works with “hundreds” of speakers, TVs, soundbars, set-top boxes, and AV receivers across over 30 brands. When Play-Fi Home Theater launches, that means there shouldn’t be a shortage of audio accessories to connect to a compatible TV. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The four numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on your iPhone in China</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XjAvk0"&gt;Apple is censoring words and phrases customers can engrave on products in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, according to a new report by the &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/"&gt;Brussels-based CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone-maker has always said it filters engraving requests to avoid racist language, vulgarities, or intellectual property violations, but CitizenLab says the company’s restrictions of political references in Hong Kong and Taiwan particularly go above and beyond legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMMu8I"&gt;“We found that part of Apple’s mainland China political censorship bleeds into both Hong Kong and Taiwan,” &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/"&gt;write the report’s authors&lt;/a&gt;. “Much of this censorship exceeds Apple’s legal obligations in Hong Kong, and we are aware of no legal justification for the political censorship of content in Taiwan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3S8wF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New report reveals extent of Apple’s engraving filters&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SSdepm"&gt;Apple does not offer a complete list of banned phrases by region, but analysis by CitizenLab found that the company filters 1,045 keywords in China, compared to 542 in Hong Kong, 397 in Taiwan, 206 in Canada, 192 in Japan, and 170 in the United States. While no political phrases are filtered in the US, Canada, or Japan, nearly half of all blocked keywords in China and Hong Kong were political in nature. CitizenLab’s analysis looked specifically at engraving requests for AirTags and iPads, but the only differences it noted in restrictions between the products were related to keyword length and lowercase words.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TL6XsgoB1Q6qDdxsYkNIjx-Kf3E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22792056/Image_6.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/08/engrave-danger-an-analysis-of-apple-engraving-censorship-across-six-regions/" target="_blank"&gt;CitizenLab&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comparisons of filtered keywords by type and region. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rReEyi"&gt;Keywords filtered in China include 政治 (politics), 抵制 (resist), 民主潮 (wave of democracy), and 人权 (human rights). For AirTag engravings, which are limited to four characters, Chinese customers are not allowed to use the four numbers 8964 — which refer to the Tiananmen Square protests, which took place on June 4th, 1989.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moS0VZ"&gt;CitizenLab says the rigorous censorship applied in mainland China bleeds into Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hong Kong is a “special administrative region” of China that has enjoyed a high level of political independence, though China has cracked down on its democratic movements in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/23/briefing/china-hong-kong-apple-daily-closure.html"&gt;recent months and years&lt;/a&gt;. Taiwan, meanwhile, is a self-governing democracy that China considers to be a breakaway state that should reunite with the mainland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3j54d"&gt;In Hong Kong, banned phrases include 雙普選 (double universal suffrage), 雨伞革命 (Umbrella Revolution), and 新聞自由 (freedom of the press). In Taiwan, Apple customers are not allowed to reference high-ranking members of the Chinese Communist Party like 孫春蘭 (Sun Chunlan) or the banned religious movement 法輪功 (Falun Gong). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8964: a reference to the Tiananmen Square protests of June 4 1989.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xGcWpD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M4sAup"&gt;CitizenLab notes that “there exists no legal obligation for Apple to perform such political censorship in Taiwan.” But Apple has repeatedly showed it will make political accommodations to preserve its presence in China, which accounts for nearly a fifth of its total revenues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5MabnH"&gt;The degree to which Apple is willing to bend to Chinese pressure has become particularly sensitive in recent weeks after the iPhone-maker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;unveiled a controversial system&lt;/a&gt; to detect CSAM (child sexual abuse material) on its devices. The system scans users’ phones locally for the illegal material, but critics worry that it could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;expanded beyond CSAM&lt;/a&gt; to detect other forms of illegal content. In China, that could include expression of political dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2jhZH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Citizen-Lab-Letter-08172021.pdf"&gt;responded to the analysis&lt;/a&gt; by CitizenLab by saying it filters engraving requests with respect to “local laws, rules, and regulations.” It did not address any criticism that it was over-zealous in its censorship in Hong Kong and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRpSAL"&gt;“We handle engraving requests regionally. There is no single global list that contains one set of words or phrases,” said Apple’s chief privacy officer Jane Horvath, in a letter. “Instead, these decisions are made through a review process where our teams assess local laws as well as their assessment of cultural sensitivities.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What Twitter should copy from Tinder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ysm4lS54eJ5Iws68gyWoToyEukY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746331/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You’ll likely be able to verify yourself twice on Tinder before you can do it once anywhere else&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="zkwSod"&gt;One of the core subjects I cover is the still-emerging field that tech companies call &lt;em&gt;trust and safety&lt;/em&gt;. Most of the time, it’s safety that grabs the headlines: hate speech on Facebook; Apple scanning devices for images of child abuse; COVID misinformation on YouTube. Today I want to talk about the trust side of the equation — specifically how platforms verify profiles. More specifically, why they should verify &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; profiles, if you want them to. No matter who you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEmOnj"&gt;Verification might seem like a dry subject, but those little checkmarks mean a lot to people. (You learn this once you get your checkmark, and friends and family immediately start asking how they can get theirs, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trPKGY"&gt;They also wind up embarrassing online platforms on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7XkCLd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter hadn’t anticipated the authenticity of rank-and-file workers would ever be up for scrutiny&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nzuPqA"&gt;In April, I wrote about&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/amazon-fights-off-its-twitter-impersonators"&gt; the case of Amazon’s Twitter army&lt;/a&gt;. At the height of Amazon’s labor battle in Bessemer, Alabama, there was no way to distinguish between workers who actually represented Amazon, and those who were posting satirically. Twitter’s verification program, which it had just spent &lt;em&gt;three years &lt;/em&gt;overhauling, had not anticipated a case in which the authenticity of rank-and-file workers would ever be up for scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSgMZ3"&gt;Then, last week, Twitter shut down its entire verification program again, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;falsely verifying at least six bot accounts&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623714/twitter-verification-program-pause-fake-accounts-review"&gt;Mitchell Clark for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjHeEY"&gt;Twitter is halting the expansion of its verification program, saying it needs to work on the application and review process that lets people into the blue check mark club. This change, where Twitter won’t be letting new people apply for verification, is coming after Twitter admitted that several fake accounts, which reportedly seemed to be part of a botnet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;were incorrectly verified&lt;/a&gt;. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HtgIG8"&gt;This isn’t the first time Twitter has paused its verification program — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;put the public process on hold in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, after it received backlash for verifying one of the organizers behind the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville. It brought back a revamped version in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;and paused it a week later&lt;/a&gt; due to an avalanche of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="QdRkSy"&gt;Baked into Twitter’s approach is the idea that verification should be rare and precious — reserved for “notable” accounts only. Facebook and Instagram take a similar approach. One of my core beliefs is that reserving verification for “notable” accounts actually &lt;em&gt;reduces&lt;/em&gt; trust in networks overall. it reserves special privileges for elites — like customer service — that should be available to all; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/10/16631774/twitter-verification-kessler-milo-abuse"&gt;it confers moral authority on whoever manages to get a checkmark&lt;/a&gt;, even if they are one of the worst actors on the network; and, of course, It breeds contempt between regular users and “bluechecks.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puA1Ku"&gt;Now, maybe at this point you’re saying: &lt;em&gt;great, thanks Casey. Another intractable platform problem that shall haunt us as long as we live&lt;/em&gt;. Not so! For another platform has tackled the problem of user authenticity in a totally different way, and the results have been … pretty great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyE2bv"&gt;The platform is Tinder, Match Group’s popular dating app. In April&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/amazon-fights-off-its-twitter-impersonators"&gt; I wrote about the app’s move last year&lt;/a&gt; to let anyone verify their account by sending in a few selfies:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TV6jvm"&gt;Upon request, Tinder sends the user a picture of a model performing specific poses. Users take selfies in the poses shown and submit them to Tinder; photos are reviewed by its community team. If the user’s poses match the model’s, they get a blue checkmark. The process takes about a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFA3Ij"&gt;Catfishing remains a significant problem on dating apps, so self-serve verification like this addresses an obvious problem. And while a blue checkmark on Tinder doesn’t tell you &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; you need to know about a potential date, it dramatically increases the odds that the person you’re talking to at least looks like their picture. The benefits are significant enough that, from what I can tell, the majority of Tinder users in my area have now verified their profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8e9sts"&gt;Tinder could have stopped there. But executives noted that their approach to verification was limited in one significant way: a significant number of Tinder users do not display images of themselves for safety reasons — particularly women and LGBTQ+ people outside of the United States. Many of these users could still benefit from verifying that they are authentic human beings looking for romance and friendship, and not bots or scammers. But if they declined to upload photos of themselves, how could they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF0SdK"&gt;This week, Tinder&lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category"&gt; said it is developing a solution to that problem&lt;/a&gt;. The company is preparing to release a second, complementary form of verification for users who don’t want to show their face. Instead of verifying a user’s identity via photos, Tinder will ask them for another form of verification — a drivers’ license, for example. (The company said it would “take into consideration expert recommendations, input from our members, what documents are most appropriate in each country, and local laws and regulations, as it determines how the feature will roll out.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fbJaq3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many users could benefit from verifying they are authentic human beings, not bots or scammers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TrXgPJ"&gt;“An ID verification offers that person a way to say, I’ve proven to Tinder that I’m real, without having to necessarily show their face if that’s something you’re not comfortable doing,” said Rory Kozoll, head of trust and safety product at Tinder, in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpKinc"&gt;The feature is still in development, and there is no timeline for its release (beyond “in the coming quarters”). But Tinder has been testing ID verification in Japan since 2019, and the company says it has worked well enough there that it is planning to release it globally. When that happens, you could choose to verify yourself both through your photos &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your ID, with both checks appearing on your profile. (The company hasn’t decided exactly how it will represent this visually on the profile.) And as Tinder gets more and more people to participate, trust in its network will increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49VlBv"&gt;“We’ve heard from customers from the beginning that authenticity was the biggest issue they had,” said Kozoll, who joined Tinder four years ago. “Just knowing: is this person who they say they are?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IjfId"&gt;The company declined to tell me how many people have chosen to verify their profiles, but said it’s by far the most popular safety-related feature the company has introduced to date. Tinder also said verified profiles are more likely to “have success” on Tinder — more matches, more conversations. It’s also helping the company counter the perception that its app, like any dating app, is overrun with catfish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CouUzt"&gt;“We’re definitely starting to see in our survey data and qualitative research that people are turning the corner on that,” Kozoll said. “Starting to feel like more of the people they see on Tinder are real. And we can correlate it with the introduction and adoption of photo verification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdhFCo"&gt;Kozoll told me that, as on Twitter, users are sometimes verified even when they don’t match. But “the volume is extremely low, almost to be statistically insignificant,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OrcmAe"&gt;In any case, he said, the benefits to verifying anyone who asks have outweighed the risks of the occasional false positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="02jjRw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Starting to feel like more of the people they see on Tinder are real”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFAfbX"&gt;Looking at Tinder’s success here, I can’t help but wonder what would happen if Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or even YouTube took a similar approach. (&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/3046484?hl=en"&gt;You need 100,000 subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to request verification on YouTube.) Photo verification could help platforms sort out human beings from bots — an increasingly urgent need in a world where&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/2/15/18226005/ai-generated-fake-people-portraits-thispersondoesnotexist-stylegan"&gt; images generated by artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt; can often fool the naked eye. ID verification could help people prove their authenticity even if they aren’t considered notable figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8P6sMc"&gt;I’d also love to see platforms let people optionally verify their employers through an email address, so we’d know if all those scientists, academics, and law enforcement officers are who they say they are, whenever events conspire to bring them into the daily news cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qK4MlY"&gt;I asked Kozoll to what extent he thought Tinder’s verification measures could be adopted by the industry at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnsUf8"&gt;“I don’t want to presume to know more about other businesses than they do,” he said. “But I think what we’re doing today is a viable approach for dating apps.” He noted that Tinder’s ideas here are not totally original — the company took inspiration from gig economy startups that require drivers to verify their photos in a similar way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4uG6U"&gt;“I think businesses that are bringing people together in real life … have more interest in making sure that those people have a higher level of authenticity,” he said. “The same rules may apply more broadly in social media, but I understand the concerns around free speech and anonymity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ivS85"&gt;But the key lesson from Tinder is that verification doesn’t have to be a binary, yes-or-no choice. Platforms can choose to let users verify aspects of their identity in different ways, granting different badges or other benefits based on what people choose to share. If they do, I imagine they’ll see what Tinder did: a network where, over time, more people come to trust one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ul5Z0v"&gt;In the meantime, you’re likely to be able to verify yourself twice on Tinder before you can do it once anywhere else. As Twitter reconsiders how to verify its user base yet again, Tinder has offered it a compelling roadmap. Here’s hoping Twitter swipes it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia expects GPU supply constraints for the ‘vast majority’ of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-EnsNvIHD8aKs42OoXQAdtcZ4ik=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69746323/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3080 GPU.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3jCyia"&gt;Nvidia warned earlier this year that the great GPU shortage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;would last throughout 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company expects supply issues to continue well into 2022. Speaking on Nvidia’s Q2 fiscal 2022 earnings call this week, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he expects supply constraints for the majority of next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dtVo"&gt;“I would expect that we will see a supply-constrained environment for the vast majority of next year is my guess at the moment,” said Huang &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4450523-nvidia-corporation-nvda-ceo-jensen-huang-on-q2-2022-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;according to a transcript of the call&lt;/a&gt;, spotted by &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-expects-supply-constraints-for-the-vast-majority-of-next-year"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Videocardz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia has committed to securing long-term supply commitments, but demand is still higher than supply right now during a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUgLsJ"&gt;Nvidia’s warnings of a GPU shortage well into 2022 might not seem as bad as they sound, though. Anecdotally, we’ve noticed Nvidia managing to resupply a range of its GPUs across both Europe and the US more frequently in recent weeks than we’ve seen since the RTX 30-series debuted last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD’s RX 6600 XT GPUs are still available at some UK retailers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NdSMUP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;AMD’s RX 6600 XT GPUs also sold&lt;/a&gt; at or under their recommended retail price recently, with plenty of the cards still in stock at UK retailers. It’s still not easy to just go out and buy the exact GPU you want, but it certainly feels like things are getting slightly better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39nHw6"&gt;Despite the shortages, Nvidia still managed to hit a &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2022"&gt;record revenue of $6.51 billion&lt;/a&gt; this quarter — up 68 percent year over year. Gaming made up $3.06 billion of Nvidia’s overall revenue, a big jump of 85 percent over the year prior. The company is now shipping most (80 percent) of its PC gaming GPUs with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441847/nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;Lite Hash Rate enabled&lt;/a&gt; to combat cryptomining demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4d5sSo"&gt;While the gaming segment is clearly thriving at Nvidia, the company’s new Cryptocurrency Mining Processor (CMP) failed to hit Nvidia’s own predictions. CMP only hit $266 million in revenue, compared to the $400 million the company had predicted. China’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt; has likely affected CMP sales, with miners &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/cryptocurrency-miners-in-china-are-beginning-to-sell-off-gpus-for-cheap/"&gt;selling off used GPUs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia admits acquisition of British chip designer Arm may take longer than 18 months </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6hfNf"&gt;Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has admitted for the first time that the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;planned acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of British chip designer Arm may take longer than the initially-scheduled 18 months. The acquisition, which would bring together two of the most powerful chip companies in the world, is facing scrutiny from regulators in the US, UK, and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGuYme"&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought, so it’s pushing out the timetable,” Huang &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3758929d-66f0-4095-94f3-ea62b92f9480"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s not one particular delay,” he added. “But we’re confident in the deal, we’re confident regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CTdVwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oC6Q3V"&gt;Huang was previously unwavering in his prediction that the acquisition would be completed by March next year. The agreement between Nvidia and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/5/12798302/softbank-arm-acquisition-complete"&gt;Arm’s current owner SoftBank&lt;/a&gt; gives the US chip designer until the end of 2022 to clear the purchase with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkjveQ"&gt;The opposition to the deal is varied and speaks to Arm’s global importance. In the UK, for example, regulators are investigating the purchase on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391744/nvidia-arm-acquisition-uk-competition-regulator-cma-investigation-national-security-grounds"&gt;national security grounds&lt;/a&gt;, but politicians have also decried the takeover as a blow to Britain’s tech industry and its sovereignty on the global stage. In the US, the FTC &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;opened an investigation&lt;/a&gt; into the acquisition after Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm complained it would limit competition. And in China, control of the globally-critical chip industry is seen as an important geopolitical battleground with the US. Chinese regulators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17614218/qualcomm-nxp-merger-fails-breakup-fee"&gt;previously nixed&lt;/a&gt; an attempt by American firm Qualcomm to buy Dutch manufacturer NXP Semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS7505"&gt;Much of the scrutiny is due to Arm’s ubiquity and perceived neutrality in the global chip business. The company sells designs to a variety of firms including Apple, Amazon, and Samsung. And while its ownership by SoftBank was seen as unproblematic as the Japanese corporation does not compete directly with these companies, there are more potential conflicts under Nvidia’s ownership, especially as Arm’s chips are increasingly favored for PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
