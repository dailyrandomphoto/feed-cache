    <title>Twitter is pausing its verification program again, after giving fake accounts blue checks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8fEvYvpDPIMP6vWxTlFU7D5Qkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722843/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gTlpAf"&gt;Twitter is once again putting a halt on applications to its verification program, saying that it needs to work on the application and review process that lets people into the blue check mark club. This change is coming after Twitter admitted that several fake accounts, which reportedly seemed to be part of a botnet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;were incorrectly verified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FcbAJ"&gt;If you’ve recently applied for verification, there is a chance you’ll get it — Twitter Verified has said that it’ll &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426227102957907968?s=20"&gt;still be reviewing existing applications&lt;/a&gt;, so the freeze is just preventing new people from being able to apply. Twitter hasn’t indicated that it’ll be making changes to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;the criteria that it uses to deem accounts as verifiable or not&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B18jY4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve temporarily hit pause on rolling out access to apply for Verification so we can make improvements to the application and review process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who have been waiting, we know this may be disappointing. We want to get things right, and appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EIT3Ly"&gt;This isn’t the first time Twitter has paused its verification program — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;put the public process on hold in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, after it received backlash for verifying one of the organizers behind the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville. It brought back a revamped version in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;and paused it a week later&lt;/a&gt; due to an avalanche of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tlHHZ"&gt;The start-stop issues Twitter has been having with its Verified program speak to the difficulties that can come with issuing a badge that is sometimes regarded by users as an endorsement. Twitter says that the purpose of the badge is to show that an account is “authentic, notable, and active,&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;but even those criteria can end up courting controversy when people who are arguably notable get their applications rejected (especially when obviously fake accounts make it through). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Sonos survey suggests the company might build a voice assistant of its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ActEr77jd6OZgmI3vqxDCuQNIBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722510/RoamSidetable.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHR0U7"&gt;Sonos might be developing a voice assistant alternative to Alexa or Google Assistant for its speakers, according to &lt;a href="https://voicebot.ai/2021/08/10/sonos-surveys-users-about-potential-voice-assistant/"&gt;a customer survey spotted by &lt;em&gt;VoiceBot.ai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The survey, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/p17y3y/sonos_acquisition_of_snips/h8c0taz?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;a Sonos customer on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, describes an on-device voice control system that would improve user privacy by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; routing questions and commands through the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I1av7"&gt;In the survey (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/g0652ei?nc=1"&gt;pictured below&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Reddit user EdmundFitzgerald29), Sonos writes that its “potential new product offering” would use the wake word “Hey Sonos” and let users control playback, search through songs, and move music to other speakers with their voice. The survey claims that the assistant can respond faster because it would be processing everything on device, rather than relying on an internet connection and sending queries to a server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRtQ4YvzY0SPHA_XL5tEbZFllIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780810/sonossurvey.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos’ survey asking for customer input on a new voice control system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qIp55"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked for comment on whether the survey was real, Sonos said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8XlL9E"&gt;We regularly put product and experience concepts in front of our customers to better understand what is important to them. We don’t have anything further to share at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HM3Yd7"&gt;There’s some reason to believe Sonos would work on a project like this. Sonos acquired its own AI voice-platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975607/sonos-buys-snips-ai-voice-assistant-privacy"&gt;in the form of Snips in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Snips’ privacy-focused tech — notably doing all processing on device — sounds a lot like the feature Sonos is now reportedly pitching to customers. Sonos also has a reason to want to provide an independent voice solution — it’s had a public falling out with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174686/sonos-google-assistant-beam-one-beta-demo-features-ces-2019"&gt;one of its voice control partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMfFXe"&gt;Sonos claims Google stole some of its multiroom audio tech during a Google Music partnership in 2013. The company apparently warned Google that it was infringing on patents during multiple Google Chromecast and Home speaker launches, but Google didn’t listen. Now the conflict is playing out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; started by Sonos in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mv7aC"&gt;It’s not clear when or if Sonos plans to introduce its own voice control system, but based on the survey, which highlights compatibility with Amazon’s Alexa and not Google Assistant, it seems like Sonos would like Google to take less of a central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVSKhm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Immunocompromised people should get a third COVID-19 vaccine dose, CDC committee says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Offers $100 Incentive For New Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ee57whWR6YLmhFAh2GoGbXmsAr4=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722373/1331502468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZKF36"&gt;Immunocompromised people should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee recommended today.  After taking only a standard, two-dose series of the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, patients may not generate enough antibodies against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rNzaz"&gt;“I have known of patients who are immunocompromised and in the hospital, they did all the right things. They’re just suffering from a lack of good vaccine protection,” says Camille Kotton, clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital, during the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IzKsXs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4yvST"&gt;The decision follows the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620757/booster-covid-vaccine-immunocompromised-fda"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday night that it has amended the emergency use authorization for both vaccines to allow the additional third shot for people who have received solid organ transplants or who have conditions that impair the immune system to a similar degree. There are no changes for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AH2Nzp"&gt;Around 7 million adults in the United States are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/02-COVID-Dooling-508.pdf"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;. They’re more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19, are more likely to have breakthrough infections even if vaccinated, and the vaccines aren’t as effective for them. People considered moderately or severely immunocompromised &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/03-COVID-Goswami-508.pdf"&gt;include people&lt;/a&gt; who have received organ transplants, in treatment for some cancers, and who take immunosuppressive medications like high-dose corticosteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgOwEz"&gt;Immunocompromised people shouldn’t need a doctor’s note or prescription to get a third dose, says Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer at the CDC. “This is self-attesting,” she told attendees at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of immunosuppressive conditions that could qualify for a third dose. Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, receipt of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy, receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy), moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency, advanced or untreated HIV infection, active treatment with biologic agents that are immunosuppressive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgKzQ_0qW-qxgsqOTPEZgtKDeDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780870/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_12.31.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A presentation at the ACIP meeting lists the conditions that could qualify for a third dose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O9OAX8"&gt;A third shot increases the proportion of immunocompromised people who produce antibodies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s still not clear if or how much that antibody boost translates to prevention of COVID-19 for this group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7TdBw"&gt;Even with a third dose, people who are immunocompromised should still take precautions against COVID-19. While the boost will likely give them some additional protection, they’d still be at high risk for a severe case of COVID-19 should they contract the disease. “Immunocompromised people should continue to wear a mask, stay six feet apart from others they don’t live with, and avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces,” Dooling says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzgwoh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony HT-A7000 review: a next-gen Atmos soundbar that’s (almost) perfect for gaming</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For those who can afford to throw cash at something that sounds great&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6PLwbl"&gt;A $1,300 soundbar doesn’t have much room for compromises. You can spend a fraction of that on a perfectly competent Vizio soundbar, and even premium options like the Sonos Arc cost hundreds less. There will always be people that balk at the notion of spending so much money and not putting it toward a traditional surround sound system — and that’s especially true (and a fair argument) when you reach this price level. So when designing its latest flagship 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar, &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-sound-bar-home-theater/all-home-theater-sound-bar/p/hta7000"&gt;the HT-A7000&lt;/a&gt;, Sony knew it couldn’t settle and had to throw in the entire kitchen sink to justify the steep investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qETMQZ"&gt;And that’s exactly what the company tried to do. The HT-A7000, which starts shipping in September, embraces gamers with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; HDMI 2.1 passthrough inputs capable of 8K, 4K at 120Hz, and Dolby Vision HDR. There are still very few soundbars on the market that are so well optimized for next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S. You can plug &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Sony and Microsoft’s consoles into the HT-A7000 and enjoy their full visual fidelity — with one unfortunate exception that I’ll explain later. If your TV cruelly only has a single HDMI 2.1 / eARC port, Sony’s new soundbar gives you an extra one. That’s something the Arc or lower-priced soundbars can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Ty8k"&gt;Sony has also stuffed this soundbar with practically every way to stream music you could possibly want. Bluetooth and a 3.5mm aux port really aren’t going to cut it for this much scratch, so you also get Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, plus the option to integrate the HT-A7000 with your Google Home or Amazon Alexa systems. You can pair a set of Bluetooth headphones to the soundbar and listen that way to avoid disturbing anyone. There’s a USB port if you want to plug in a drive that contains your FLAC collection or whatever local audio you feel like playing. The soundbar also supports pretty much every home theater audio codec under the sun, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJQJoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10700005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HoZJNC"&gt;The HT-A7000 is about as future-proofed and loaded with tech as soundbars come. It’s not intended for home theater enthusiasts who want to carefully consider and piece together every individual component of their ideal surround system. This is for the sort of person already splurging on a Sony A90J OLED with enough disposable income to add Sony’s top-tier soundbar to their cart. But to really, truly get the most from the HT-A7000, you’ll also eventually want the optional set of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sars3s"&gt;wireless rear speakers&lt;/a&gt; ($349.99) and standalone subwoofer (&lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sasw3"&gt;$399.99 for 200W&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sasw5"&gt;$699.99 for 300W&lt;/a&gt;). All in, the bundle of products I reviewed would cost $2,349.97 before tax. That’s about the same as buying one of those high-end Sony OLED TVs I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoRHb"&gt;So while testing the HT-A7000, I’ve gone about it in two different configurations: I’ve used the soundbar by itself plenty since some buyers will just stop there. But I’ve also put the kitted out, exorbitantly priced system through its paces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48xVxI"&gt;HT-A7000 on its own&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bCL9Ah"&gt;When set up by itself, the HT-A7000 is a 7.1.2 soundbar. That breaks down into five front-facing speakers plus two beam tweeters (7), a built-in subwoofer (1), and the pair of upward-firing Atmos speakers (2). For comparison, the Sonos Arc is a 5.0.2 speaker (and becomes 5.1.2 if you add a Sub to the equation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqXbfKZmlovKnx2_wfUMiRF8ICg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780495/DSCF4584_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s HT-A7000 is an Atmos 7.1.2 soundbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQsSGx"&gt;It certainly &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; the part of a premium soundbar, though I’ll let you decide whether the glass top surface and mix of textures and materials are befitting of the price. On top are capacitive touch buttons for power, input, volume, Bluetooth, and so on. And behind the HT-A7000’s front grill is a small display that shows what input it’s playing from (HDMI 1, 2, or TV) and shows the volume or sound mode when you’re making adjustments. When you’re watching something through one of the two passthrough HDMI ports, you can hit the remote’s “display” button for a summary on your TV screen that details the current audio signal and whether the vertical speakers are active. When the soundbar is outputting TV audio, you’ll see those details on the tiny front display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwauUP"&gt;Around back is the arsenal of ports: two HDMI in, one HDMI out, inputs for analog and optical audio, a USB type-A port, and power. Aside from the bundled remote control and HDMI cable, Sony also includes brackets and screws for the HT-A7000 in the box if you want to wall-mount it. I can’t really find any faults with the remote: it’s very Sony, but at least there are individual buttons for both HDMI inputs and all the sound modes you’ll use most often. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0COLOydwA0CAqdPGcuV03wPuQ7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780498/DSCF4564.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are touch controls on the soundbar’s glass surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B47h5c"&gt;Setting up the soundbar was quite simple thanks to Sony’s on-screen instructions. I plugged in the devices I wanted to run through the soundbar, plugged it into my LG CX’s eARC port, and I was good to go. In terms of sound performance, the HT-A7000 ranks up there with the very best Atmos soundbars. I felt it my duty to shell out the $20 to rent &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; and experience big Hollywood blockbuster action, and I wasn’t disappointed. Car chases and action sequences are enthralling when coming out of this 7.1.2 bar, and it does manage to provide a distinct feeling of sweeping surround effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D14JsX"&gt;I also spent some time watching &lt;em&gt;Dave Matthews &amp;amp; Tim Reynolds: Live at Radio City&lt;/em&gt; — a Blu-ray I’ve seen used as a demo at audio briefings more than once. Both acoustic guitars came through with warmth, terrific detail, and just the right kind of jangle. The vocals stayed crisp and distinct in the center channel throughout every song. Sony’s S-Force Pro Surround and Vertical Surround Engine technologies do a good job of dispersing sound around the room when you’re watching anything that has a surround mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X8k4UfcU7QWqovBljw3UrdX81g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780572/DSCF4603.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A7000 is quite a bit larger than the Sonos Arc. For scale, behind both is a 55-inch TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DipeAL"&gt;The immersion factor grew more impressive when I watched Atmos content from Netflix or through my Movies Anywhere library. Sony has a “sound field optimization” process that helps the soundbar tune itself for your room. It plays a few loud noises that help the device detect how far away the walls to its left and right are (like Sonos’ TruePlay tuning system), and it detects ceiling distance as well. (You can manually input these numbers if you’ve measured for yourself and want to make sure they’re perfect.) With more drivers at its disposal, the Sony outperformed my Sonos Arc — though not by as nearly as much as I expected considering the $500 price gap. The effect of the height channels was very similar in both speakers. Sony includes different sound modes like auto, standard, cinema, and others like “voice” that emphasize dialogue or “night,” which limits the boominess when you’re watching at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rq-XieEMSrtYY1PLHRNbpkOaqOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780591/DSCF4572.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small display shows volume adjustments, what mode the soundbar is in, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCBoxM6LGSfeAK8tP-MGj7-4Tow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780680/DSCF4614.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A7000 comes with an extremely Sony remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MRBfT4"&gt;Surprisingly there’s no preset audio mode for gaming. But even so, the HT-A7000 kicked out powerful audio when I was playing &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;on PS5, with no noticeable audio and video sync issues. Switching over to my Xbox Series X, the story was the same. Passthrough largely worked flawlessly, with the soundbar correctly detected different audio codecs being sent from games and streaming apps on the game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLIvHE"&gt;But then I realized something was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mctkj6"&gt;See, one area where the HT-A7000 falters with gaming is a familiar one for Sony: variable refresh rate. Currently, the soundbar is incapable of passthrough for both VRR and ALLM (auto low latency mode). That’s a significant downside for owners of the Xbox Series X or Series S; both consoles can use VRR to help smoothen out any dips in frame rate as you play. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; felt noticeably more choppy when played through the soundbar without VRR. Sony told me that it recommends Xbox owners plug directly into an HDMI 2.1 port on their TV. The PS5 still doesn’t offer support for VRR, so if that’s your chosen console, you’re not really losing out on much right now. Either way, you’ll need to make sure you apply the ideal settings for gaming to whatever HDMI port the HT-A7000 is running into, since the lack of ALLM passthrough will keep your TV from making those changes automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBDdIR"&gt;The omission of VRR and ALLM passthrough is enough to prevent the HT-A7000 from being the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; soundbar for next-gen gaming that I hoped it might be, which is unfortunate. It’s a great match for PS5 at the moment, but losing VRR on Xbox is hard to swallow for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fUPt9b"&gt;With the optional subwoofer and rear surrounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n2zDg0"&gt;As capable as the HT-A7000 is by its lonesome, more speakers are always better when it comes to home theater. Adding in the wireless soundbar and rear surrounds was painless; the soundbar automatically detects them and starts feeding audio to them immediately. (The soundbar’s remote control has buttons for the add-ons, too.) All the virtualization tech in the world still can’t compete with discrete speakers placed behind you, and I got the most enjoyment out of Sony’s new system with the added gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dll7Sm0JxSA4a7C65GcuXYsdRE8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780747/DSCF4620_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s optional rear surround speakers and subwoofer unlock the HT-A7000’s full potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXzv9f"&gt;I wish the rear surrounds had up-firing Atmos drivers, like the rears that come with Vizio’s Elevate bar do, but nope. They’re just traditional stereo speakers. Sony’s 300W subwoofer can push out some truly growling, reverberating bass. It’s frankly too much for my Brooklyn apartment, but if you’re not at risk of annoying the neighbors, it’s a thrill to unleash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VbXT2s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10700063"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mNPsPb"&gt;The fully fleshed system is a joy for movies and TV shows, but it also makes a noticeable difference for 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos music, which is all the rage lately. You can really sense the unique placement and details when listening on a proper surround system. Apple Music’s spatial audio feels less gimmicky in this context than it does when listening through headphones. Other features of the HT-A7000 like Chromecast and AirPlay 2 have worked just fine, though keep in mind they’re only there for audio playback on this device and not video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvCNk5"&gt;Sony’s HT-A7000 is a wonderful, powerful soundbar, but it comes at a hefty premium that a lot of people will never seriously consider when options like the Sonos Arc and Vizio Elevate offer excellent performance for considerably less. I can’t help but think that Sony should have included either the rear speakers or subwoofer in the box with this one. Having to tack everything on separately makes the whole proposition an even tougher sell as you cross the $2,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="f93w2X"&gt;The level of future-proofing here is impressive. But since my LG CX has four HDMI 2.1 ports, I already had everything I needed with my Arc, Xbox Series X, and PS5. The passthrough aspect of the HT-A7000 isn’t a big selling point for me, though it does work as advertised — except for the VRR situation. If that asterisk weren’t present, I’d feel more comfortable labeling the HT-A7000 as worthy of the price for those who can swing it and want a simple path to sublime home theater audio. If you’re not an Xbox gamer, maybe it’s still worthy of that title. This is a soundbar that truly does everything. But it comes at such a premium that anything less than perfection is a reason for pause and closely examining other options. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lamborghini Countach, the poster car of ‘80s luxury, is back — and it’s a hybrid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3H-P_u9kb_6NL7wsNpVu1gCbT04=/814x0:5358x3029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722200/COUNTACH_LPI800_4__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Somebody get a doctor, this Lambo is sick&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YlHGil"&gt;Lamborghini unveiled its revamped Countach supercar at Pebble Beach this week, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616693/lamborghini-countach-teaser-hybrid-supercar"&gt;as predicted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s rocking a little lightning under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O02q59"&gt;The limited edition supercar is called the Countach LPI 800-4, with LPI standing for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, or Longitudinal Posterior Hybrid; 800 referring to the rounding down of the engine’s 814cv maximum combined power; and 4 to its permanent four-wheel drive transmission. The automaker is releasing the revamped version in honor of the 50th anniversary of the original release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmAnyK"&gt;The revived Countach will have an aspirated V12 engine with a 48V electric motor — meaning the supercar will retain its familiar engine growl while also receiving some of its power from electrons. According to Lamborghini, the thermal unit will have an output of 780cv (a metric unit of horsepower that translates to 574kW), while the e-motor will generate 34cv. That produces a 0–100km/h time of 2.8 seconds, a 0–200km/h time of 8.6 seconds, and a top speed of 355km/h. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e0veRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10700038"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOXkKS"&gt;To be sure, the Countach’s hybrid system isn’t anything new; it’s based on the &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/21/lamborghini-sian-hybrid-system-explained-details/"&gt;supercapacitor technology used in Lamborghini’s Sián&lt;/a&gt;. Lamborghini claims this provides three-times the power of a lithium-ion battery with the same weight. Notably, it does not reflect the new hybrid and pure-electric vehicle systems that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440143/lamborghini-ev-electric-supercar-hybrid-models-announce"&gt;Italian automaker is currently working on&lt;/a&gt;, which will underpin Lamborghini’s new batch of hybrids and EVs to be released later this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOWxON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the patriarch of modern super sports car design”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1Baa4"&gt;Lamborghini calls the Countach “the patriarch of modern super sports car design,” and indeed its distinctive wedge shape and sleek, villainous lines proved to be a popular cultural touchstone for many growing up in the 1970s and ‘80s. If you didn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Lamborghini-Countach-Poster/dp/B086JCKN8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a poster of the Countach&lt;/a&gt; on your wall, you definitely knew someone who did. And if you dreamed about striking it rich and buying a mansion someday, that image most likely included a Countach in your five-car garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mul67p"&gt;The new Countach pays homage to its predecessor, “but it is not retrospective,” Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said in a statement. “It upholds the Lamborghini tradition of looking forward, of exploring new design and technology avenues while celebrating the DNA of our brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlFArQ0k7aPIFHHAm1XYA8kv-hY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780672/Countach_LPI_800_4_Outdoor__6_.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Countach is less angular than its predecessor, but maintains its wedge-shape. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQf3y68wyRWIM2YMNYrQtiX7vc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780676/Countach_LPI_800_4_Outdoor__32_.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The revived Countach will be a limited run; Lamborghini is only making 112 units.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRZwvp"&gt;Viewed side by side, the revived Countach isn’t as sharply angled as its forebear, with a rounder nose and a less severe-looking rear. There’s no spoiler, and the airscoops are integrated in the shoulders of the car, embellished with Lamborghini’s distinctive slatted “gills.” Still, Lamborghini did a decent job updating the look while retaining the shape and overall feel of the classic supercar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pIjizo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lamborghini did a decent job updating the look &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dji9PO"&gt;The chassis and body panels are made out of carbon fiber, giving the Countach LPI 800-4 a dry weight of 1,595kg (3,516lbs) for a dry weight to power ratio of 1.95kg/cv. Carbon fiber is also featured in the front splitter, around the front window and side-view mirrors, engine bonnet cover intakes, and rocker panels, as well as in the interior. Lamborghini used #D-printing to produce movable air vents and a “photochromatic” roof, which can shift from solid to transparent at the touch of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OymRE_tPTUXD0tj1i-VlX9VyL_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780712/Countach_LPI800_4_Interior_8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s an 8.4-inch touchscreen inside, but honestly who’s paying attention to such trivial details. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZeu8t"&gt;Inside, an 8.4-inch touchscreen manages the car’s controls. The operating system is compatible with Apple CarPlay. But let’s face it, if you’re rich enough to own this car, pairing the OS to your smartphone is not your highest priority. Tearing ass through the Italian countryside is what this is really about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRz3h0"&gt;But then again, these images are likely to be as close as we ever get to this car. Lamborghini is only making 112 units, a reference to the “LP 112” internal project name used during the original Lamborghini Countach’s development. Deliveries will begin in the first quarter of 2022, and no, Lamborghini is not revealing the sticker price. Probably for the best; I’m not sure my blood pressure could handle it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to locate your Android phone with Google’s Find My Device</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The S21’s metal side rails curve into the camera bump" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JCOg_GY_fbtBGQMexHPrgqd0kxw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722184/vpavic_210118_4378_0178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aEgS5g"&gt;Phones have become so much a part of our daily lives that it can be immediately traumatic if you suddenly can’t find your phone — whether you’ve left it in a cab, accidentally dropped it out of your pocket, or lost it under your bed. If you have an Android phone, you can use the Find My Device feature to (hopefully) locate your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QymQDE"&gt;Find My Device depends on two things being enabled: the feature itself (of course) and Google’s Location services. In addition, the phone also has to be turned on and signed in to a Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsIzvL"&gt;The Find My Device feature comes as part of the standard OS on Pixels and several other Android phones, and is usually turned on by default. Be aware that some Android models may offer a different app; for example, Samsung phones have their own &lt;a href="https://findmymobile.samsung.com/"&gt;Find My Mobile&lt;/a&gt; app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvBwmh"&gt;If you want to use Google’s Find My Device, you can check to see if it’s part of your phone’s version of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wzQpui"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Security and look for Find My Device. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FoseGB"&gt;If the app is listed, but is turned off, tap on it and use the toggle to turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="11vJ1Y"&gt;If you don’t have the Google app, but would like to use it instead of the app that your manufacturer has installed — or if you want to use an Android tablet rather than a computer to find your phone or watch —  you can go to the Play Store and install &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm"&gt;Google’s Find My Device app&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjNINx"&gt;Next, you can check to see if Location is enabled:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nC47zr"&gt;Go to your phone’s Settings and find Location. It will say right underneath the header whether it’s on or off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TsOANl"&gt;If it’s off, tap on Location and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cm97hY"&gt;You can also check which apps have access to your location, and which have used it recently. If you want to take this opportunity to fine-tune this setting, tap on “App permission” to tweak location permission settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Security &amp;amp;gt; Find My Device to make sure it’s enabled." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MhnfyV3b67G5A0lkezlnAVjbpFw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780725/Screenshot_20210813_104129.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Security &amp;gt; Find My Device to make sure the feature is enabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once Location is enabled, you can tweak the settings of your various apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DHqEBGO9G7RDbtkCaye82UhAPAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780726/Screenshot_20210813_104800.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once Location is enabled, you can tweak the settings of your various apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PZOUca"&gt;Find your phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DQT04g"&gt;Now, you’re set. If you can’t find your phone, simply go to Google’s search page and type “Find my device.” If you haven’t used it before, you may need to give Google permission to use location data to locate your device. You may also be able to immediately ring your phone from the Google search page to try to find it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After giving permission, you may be able to ring your phone directly from the Google search page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kUCYxNQVTzA_lQcS3Ee55K9ypFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780755/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_10.54.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After giving permission, you may be able to ring your phone directly from the Google search page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WzAgDG"&gt;Otherwise, click on the link and you’ll be taken to the Find My Device page, which will name your phone, the last time it was pinged (and the name of the Wi-Fi network it was using), and the current battery power. A Google map will show where your phone was last located.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve located your phone, you have three options: ping it, lock it, or erase it. (The Google map on the right has been blocked out for privacy.)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0bGu3d_OMfhOOWDp-65z2YE7AM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780745/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_10.57.42_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve located your phone, you have three options: ping it, lock it, or erase it. (The Google map on the right has been blocked out for privacy.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vn4EWy"&gt;Once you’ve located your device, there are three options that are listed on the left side of the screen. Which you choose depends on whether you feel the device is in a safe place or not. You can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0dxrq0"&gt;Have the device play a sound (usually, the ringtone) for five minutes so you can locate it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pCR8QP"&gt;Lock the device and sign out of your Google account, so that your data will be safe while you go to retrieve it (recommended if, say, you’ve left it in a cab or restaurant).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cVZH6e"&gt;Erase the device. This is for times when you’re reasonably sure it’s been stolen and is not retrievable; you won’t be able to locate your device after that, but your content will no longer be on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger is adding end-to-end encryption for voice and video calls</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rby8O3"&gt;Facebook is adding end-to-end encryption for voice and video calls in Messenger. The company &lt;a href="https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/"&gt;announced in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s rolling out the change today alongside new controls for its disappearing messages. Some users may also see new test features related to encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osiXFz"&gt;Facebook Messenger &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13161224/facebook-messenger-encryption-privacy-enable"&gt;got end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt; for text messages in 2016, when Facebook added a “secret conversation” option to its app. Now, that mode also supports calling. Facebook says it’s adding the feature as interest in voice and video calls grows, saying Messenger now sees more than 150 million video calls a day.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4FStRQ"&gt;Facebook chat app WhatsApp already offered calling with end-to-end encryption or E2EE, which prevents anyone but a sender and receiver from seeing the encrypted data. So do some other video calling apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535818/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-security-privacy-video-conferencing"&gt;like Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007060492-Voice-or-Video-Calling-with-Screen-Sharing"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22623627%2Ffacebook-messenger-video-calls-end-to-end-encryption" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook characterizes E2EE as “becoming the industry standard” across messaging services. Earlier &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197222/facebook-messenger-instagram-end-to-end-encryption-feature-zuckerberg"&gt;rumors have suggested&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook might roll out a unified, end-to-end encrypted messaging system across WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram — but so far, that hasn’t happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fik4DJ"&gt;Text conversations are getting a smaller update. If you’re setting a message to disappear, you’ll see more options for picking when it expired, from between five seconds and 24 hours. (It originally offered one-minute, 15-minute, one-hour, four-hour, and 24-hour increments.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p4csoO"&gt;While everyone will see the updates above, Facebook is running a limited beta test of other features. Some users will see an option for end-to-end encrypted group chats and calls between “friends and family that already have an existing chat thread or are already connected.” Others will get support for Facebook’s existing non-E2EE controls over who can reach them on Messenger. And finally, if you use Instagram, a “limited test” will offer opt-in E2EE for that app’s direct messages as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing Starliner launch delayed again as it returns to the factory for troubleshooting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehbF-QksgbPfpB_u9lnYSokQSns=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722124/E8ryUfvX0AIJNno.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Boeing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SegDn"&gt;Boeing’s Starliner astronaut capsule won’t be launching to the International Space Station until it’s gone through “deeper-level troubleshooting” to fix an issue with stuck propulsion system valves, &lt;a href="https://starlinerupdates.com/starliner-returning-to-factory-to-resolve-valve-issue/"&gt;according to a press release from the company&lt;/a&gt;. That troubleshooting means removing the capsule from the Atlas V rocket it’s been coupled to and bringing it back to Boeing’s facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWfPZr"&gt;The spacecraft’s initial launch attempt late last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;was scrubbed hours before liftoff&lt;/a&gt; after engineers noticed a group of fuel valves in the Starliner’s propulsion section weren’t positioned as programmed. That valve issue, whose cause remains a mystery, is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;latest engineering predicament to curse Starliner&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years after the capsule failed its first attempt to reach the space station in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4PtvP"&gt;With a clear fix to the valve issue still elusive, having to take Starliner back to the hangar will push Boeing’s plans to launch this month off the table, and a logjam of other scheduled flights could extend the delay by several months. &lt;a href="https://starlinerupdates.com"&gt;According to Boeing VP John Vollmer&lt;/a&gt;, the company will “continue to work the issue from the Starliner factory and have decided to stand down for this launch window to make way for other national priority missions.” The new launch date will have to be jointly decided by NASA, Boeing, and the United Launch Alliance after the issue with the valves has been found and fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="auP3zH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boeing will “continue to work the issue from the Starliner factory”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ludtAc"&gt;Starliner’s mission, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22597808/boeing-starliner-ula-launch-nasa-commercial-crew-iss"&gt;called Orbital Flight Test 2 or OFT-2&lt;/a&gt;, would be a roughly ten-day test mission without any humans aboard. It’s poised to launch from Florida atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket, fly to the space station, demonstrate a clean docking procedure, and stay docked for roughly ten days before returning back to Earth. It’s a do-over of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030034/boeing-cst-100-starliner-atlas-v-launch-oft-watch-live-date-time"&gt;its first attempt in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;, when a hodgepodge of software glitches prevented it from reaching the space station and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/22/21033757/boeing-cst-100-starliner-landing-success-oft-rough-flight"&gt;forced an early return two days after launch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccLCuw"&gt;Boeing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;has said software isn’t to blame&lt;/a&gt; for Starliner’s new valve problem, and indicated in past statements that it’s a more complex hardware issue. Aerojet Rocketdyne, which supplied Starliner’s propulsion system that the valves are a part of, is working with Boeing and NASA to get to the bottom of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Playing with Hasbro’s ultimate toy, the $750 self-transforming Optimus Prime </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DFarOoYeIz71snrIIoevmbgxH9M=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722051/shollister_210724_4708_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It’s a real robot, with some real robot issues&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lUkllq"&gt;Growing up, I thought my generation had the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; toys: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmaFPA"&gt;Nerf blasters, laser tag, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311479/nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary-switch-gaming"&gt;Game Boy&lt;/a&gt;, Legos in their prime, &lt;a href="https://melmagazine.com/en-us/story/super-soaker-oral-history"&gt;genuinely powerful&lt;/a&gt; Super Soakers, and of course, transforming action figures of all kinds. But I never did get into &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; proper, because the slow-to-convert toys felt tedious compared to the show. I wound up settling for simpler toys &lt;a href="http://www.virtualtoychest.com/k/keyforce/keyforce.html"&gt;like Key Force&lt;/a&gt;, all the while dreaming of the day Transformers could transform themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBE4nc"&gt;If you’ve got the money and a hard floor, that day may have finally arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPFCtL"&gt;For $750, &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;Hasbro will now sell you&lt;/a&gt; a 19-inch-tall Optimus Prime robot that can literally unfold from a semi into a humanoid robot all by itself, and that’s just the start. Created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21057762/robosen-transformer-t9-robot-toy-ces-2020"&gt;by Robosen, a company that’s been building toward this moment for years&lt;/a&gt;, the new Optimus can pose; walk; dance; blast and slice; do push-ups; roll out and drive; even automatically &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XX9_uOEnHjM"&gt;simulate breathing&lt;/a&gt;, all while delivering a wide array of original lines from Optimus Prime’s voice actor Peter Cullen himself. &lt;em&gt;It’s awesome&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e4Y-KnbjYIfIfQrm9ypEUuU_1Qw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22433512/Apr_09_2021_17_13_10.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CShNQk"&gt;After several lengthy play sessions, I was ready to say it’s one of the coolest toys ever made — until my unit seemingly broke while running some final tests yesterday evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpoSLX"&gt;Before I get into that and some other major limitations, a warning: this toy may sell out, or already be sold out, while you continue to read. Hasbro says &lt;a href="https://hasbropulse.com/products/transformers-optimus-prime-auto-converting-programmable-robot-collectors-edition"&gt;it’s available&lt;/a&gt; in “limited quantities” starting at 1PM ET today, the same time I published this story, and the company wouldn’t tell me how many that means. I know that’s not much help, but you should have until December, when the first units start to ship, if you decide to get one and later change your mind. (Those who pre-purchased one months ago should be getting them in November.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf4pgn"&gt;Another note: if you click &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4rk5ovyEh8s"&gt;links like this&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll find I illustrate a lot of my upcoming points with video clips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0Hn9zE2Zjk5U3URTIheRvPfNhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22777052/shollister_210724_4708_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The red plate behind his head pops right off if you like, but you’ll want it on when he transforms.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KXs02G"&gt;Touchy programmable motors in disguise&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6wLY7y"&gt;The first thing you should probably understand about the “Transformers Optimus Prime Auto-Converting Programmable Robot” is that it’s more &lt;em&gt;robot&lt;/em&gt; than toy — and I mean a dumb, programmable robot, not the intelligent learning kind. Don’t expect a posable action figure you can leave perched on a shelf: it needs a constant flow of electricity to its 27 servo motors to keep itself from collapsing into a pile of robotic joints on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qquf8g"&gt;Don’t expect big action-y strides while walking, either: Optimus has &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/n4nZ2K42sVM"&gt;a remarkably dainty walk&lt;/a&gt; and has to shuffle his feet against the ground to turn, likely because his high center of gravity would make him tip over otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddjw9J"&gt;In fact, it’s such a balancing act that Optimus can’t even stand or walk if there’s the slightest amount of padding on your floor. My first hour with the leader of the Autobots was filled with disappointment as I tried carpet, rugs, mats, and the raised, grout-lined tiles of my kitchen floor &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P_TJ7UQSDzo"&gt;only to watch Optimus flop on his face&lt;/a&gt;, or listen to constant “LEFT LEG IS STUCK, REBOOT TO RESTORE” alerts belching from the bot’s speaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGWw8lmjs6QgRu76r-vBgg-pXfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780186/optimus_prime_exploded_view_robosen.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Robosen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s inside Robosen’s Optimus Prime: lots of little black motor boxes, covered by panels and joints. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Epwpgj"&gt;Any time this happens, even if it’s just a wheel that could no longer turn after you drove into a pillow, you need to power off the entire system and start again. Simply repositioning the offending joint doesn’t help: if any of those 27 motors shuts down to protect itself, you’ll be interrupting play for 20 seconds to power down and power up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfEQZg"&gt;At six pounds, Optimus is also heavy enough that I’m wary of having it around younger kids. My four-year-old &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; watching and helping me play, but the bot doesn’t have any smarts to keep it from pinching fingers or toppling over if you bump into it. I even had a scare in the kitchen when the bot instantly powered off &lt;em&gt;and dropped like a stone&lt;/em&gt; when I stabbed a button in the iOS app too many times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kr7gnH"&gt;While I’m talking rough edges, you’ll also want to temper your expectations around voice control: Google or Alexa this is not. While Hasbro makes it seem like you can just say, “Hey Optimus Prime” and begin shouting out a wide variety of commands, I found clearly enunciating even the very specific, well-defined phrases in the manual rarely worked, usually doing nothing at all — except the one that makes Optimus convert between semi and humanoid forms. Even then, you have to get the timing right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="h07V6F"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NmFoXh24Cjk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vleKg5"&gt;But the biggest issue I’ve had, of course, is the one that seems to have grounded my borrowed Optimus Prime for good. I don’t know if it was &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/P_TJ7UQSDzo"&gt;that last fall&lt;/a&gt; or what, but his entire hip joint motor no longer functions as of yesterday evening, and I haven’t had time to ship it back for inspection or even get an answer from the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEavLb"&gt;I’m hoping it’s a fluke — because that very first day, when I took Optimus out to my concrete slab patio and stopped relying on voice, I couldn’t stop grinning at this awesome toy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G647Pp"&gt;More than meets the eye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BFYh0W"&gt;Watching a genuine robot Optimus Prime come to life, fire up headlights and taillights, roll out, stand up, flash his electric blue eyes and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/XX9_uOEnHjM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;visibly start breathing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an absolute trip. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/1jRy4N-1loU"&gt;Delivering badass lines&lt;/a&gt;, dance poses, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Ku51mDvYNnI"&gt;doing push-ups&lt;/a&gt;: hell yes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXm94D"&gt;The high-density clamshell foam carrying case looks and feels great, as do his iconic ion blaster and fully translucent energon-axe — even if it’s &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; weird Robosen &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/LscrbNsz7xQ"&gt;chose to tack on machine gun sounds&lt;/a&gt; instead of ion blasts. There are loads of translucent and chromed-out details, too, and you can even flip open Optimus’s side mirrors and wrist communicators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oBcyG8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10699627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDxep6"&gt;Originally, I expected the novelty would wear off after a few minutes, after I’d transformed back and forth a few times, listened to a dozen catchphrases and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/Pe68vlnlidI"&gt;driven Optimus around&lt;/a&gt;. But after I got my first low battery warning after nearly two hours of play (a good showing for any R/C toy, much less one with 27 motors, lights and sound!), I was already ready to charge it back up and program some new moves myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJfbwF"&gt;Besides voice, there are four basic ways to play with Optimus using the iOS and Android app. First, there’s a limited, direct &lt;strong&gt;remote control&lt;/strong&gt; where you move a virtual joystick to drive or walk around, plus buttons to transform, honk, slice, shoot, or trigger a random “action.” There’s absolutely room for improvement here: the virtual joystick is pretty sloppy, driving’s a little jerky, and for some reason Optimus kept honking when I turned, but it’s a great way to show off a range of motion quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="VCxU2g"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GeJx3PtL0As?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PlHQ82"&gt;Or, you can fire a handful of&lt;strong&gt; actions&lt;/strong&gt; on command: dabbing, firing a series of punches, delivering a gesture-filled speech about freedom, or striking a hero pose, to name a few. You can unlock more actions, voice lines, and original &lt;em&gt;Transformers&lt;/em&gt; music by doing &lt;strong&gt;missions. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4V2oH"&gt;Missions guide you through new poses in one of two ways: either an extremely simple block-based coding system where you drag and drop the desired rotation, speed, and timing for each joint you want to move (say, pulling an elbow, shoulder, and wrist slowly backward for a moment before you quickly pump a fist in the air) — or a method where you actually physically push each of Optimus’ joints into your desired position to create a pose, then build a whole sequence of those poses so Optimus can smoothly move between them. Then, you can freely switch over to the creator mode and build entirely new actions on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXlEFjN5xW7a_WUi8cuIZcnymOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780184/joint_lock_optimus_prime.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can “lock” and “unlock” joints one at a time to make it easier, but it takes a while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bz0nwY"&gt;The software’s pretty cumbersome, and it can be a painstaking process — both in terms of holding all the bot’s joints upright in the position you want and the trial and error you’ll go through to see which movements Optimus can actually do without tipping. I spent 30 minutes trying to make Optimus stand on one leg, but I’m not entirely sure it’s possible to do that starting from a standing position — which the software&lt;em&gt; always&lt;/em&gt; assumes you will. In fact, there’s no way to program anything for Optimus Prime’s truck form, or make the wheels spin at all in those modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPX20p"&gt;And though the mobile app lets you unlock a USB mode, one where you can access the robot’s internal flash storage and theoretically program your own moves with an easier interface on PC, the company doesn’t have an app available for download yet and hasn’t answered questions about when one might arrive. I tried pulling one of the existing files into the Windows app that lets you program Robosen’s earlier T9 bot, but it immediately crashed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz6zOV"&gt;Yet, as frustrating as I’m making this sound, none of it killed my enthusiasm: before my unit broke, I was looking forward to programming some dance moves this weekend. Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="eC77cX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Kj1-rrh_10?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cjopo1"&gt;Closing thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vIUe0D"&gt;I won’t be buying one of these. I can’t justify that $750 price tag, now that everyone knows the “it’ll teach my kids to program!” excuse isn’t sound. But I wonder if I’ll come to regret it, the same way I regret not snapping up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/31/16234244/lego-star-wars-millennium-falcon-set-7541-pieces-800-dollars"&gt;an $800 Lego Ultimate Collector’s Edition Millennium Falcon&lt;/a&gt; when I had the chance — or if, perhaps, an even better version will come along that’s even truer to the ‘80s animated series, one that doesn’t have to turn around before it transforms and hopefully one with inertial sensors to balance itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfLFSg"&gt;I wouldn’t count it out because we now live in a golden era of glorious toys that kids could never afford: $2,200 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.segway.com%2Fsegway-ninebot-gokart-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F22623017%2Foptimus-prime-transformer-auto-converting-programmable-robot-hasbro-robosen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hoverboard go-karts&lt;/a&gt;, $300 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22324389/nerf-gun-diy-homemade-blaster-out-of-darts-jupiter-caliburn-captain-slug-hasbro"&gt;3D-printed Nerf blasters&lt;/a&gt;, $160 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457616/spyra-two-water-gun-toy-pool-not-crowdfunded"&gt;self-pressurizing digital water guns&lt;/a&gt;, $400+ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;portable gaming PCs&lt;/a&gt;, $1,000+ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;self-flying cameras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235565/samsung-galaxy-fold-phone-status-symbol-price"&gt;folding phones&lt;/a&gt;, and one incredible &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; toy after another (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17464476/radio-flyer-lukes-landspeeder-toys-star-wars-play-test"&gt;Radio Flyer Landspeeder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535512/the-mandalorian-star-wars-hasbro-toy-ship-razor-crest-baby-yoda"&gt;Razor Crest ship&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701781/star-wars-boba-fett-black-series-helmet-hasbro-costume-cosplay-toy-san-diego-comic-con-2019"&gt;Boba Fett helmet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22153843/the-mandalorian-rifle-nerf-star-wars-amban-phase-pulse-blaster"&gt;Mandalorian Nerf rifle&lt;/a&gt;). And &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397289/lego-new-r2-d2-star-wars-droid-may-4th-release-date-price"&gt;Lego’s R2-D2 &lt;/a&gt;is a perfect example of where such a toy has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dsz4kS"&gt;Heck, Lego has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fcategories%2Fadults-welcome&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F22623017%2Foptimus-prime-transformer-auto-converting-programmable-robot-hasbro-robosen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an entire Adults Welcome campaign&lt;/a&gt; now, highlighting an incredibly detailed line of expensive and oft-nostalgia infused sets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345026/lego-space-shuttle-nasa-discovery-columbia-hubble-telescope"&gt;the $200 Space Shuttle Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="oKLYmS"&gt;My generation &lt;em&gt;still &lt;/em&gt;has the best toys, I’ve discovered, because they’re building them for us as adults. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Arcade is getting a new Castlevania game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bI9eCXa-GFkTcZnrkrg8Qzu4fsE=/400x0:4720x2880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721901/15_5120x2880.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRo2hd"&gt;With the exception of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;an anime series on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, the last few years have been quiet when it comes to the gothic action series &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt;. It looks like that’s about to change, though: developer Konami just announced a new game coming exclusively to Apple Arcade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Z3fkCp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10432584"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFIiYt"&gt;The new title is called &lt;em&gt;Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s described as “an original side-scrolling action game that features a line-up of classic, well-loved characters from the series’ hit catalogue.” The graphics certainly look like a departure for the series, but there are some notable names on board, including character designer Ayami Kojima and composer Michiru Yamane, both of whom have contributed to the series since the iconic &lt;em&gt;Symphony of the Night&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t have a release date, but Apple says that it’s “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ygusmb"&gt;If the name sounds familiar, it’s probably because Konami previously soft-launched a version of &lt;em&gt;Grimoire of Souls&lt;/em&gt; in Canada &lt;a href="https://toucharcade.com/2020/07/09/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls-release-date-closing-canada-ios-android-free/"&gt;before shutting it down last year&lt;/a&gt;. That iteration was free-to-play with added microtransactions, a feature that is absent from all Apple Arcade games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXzwRr"&gt;The news comes at a fairly busy time for Apple’s subscription games service. Today sees the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616888/fantasian-part-2-apple-arcade-release-date"&gt;part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a classic RPG from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585353/apple-arcade-tetris-beat-skate-city-tokyo-monster-hunter-stories"&gt;the music-focused &lt;em&gt;Tetris Beat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is also on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
