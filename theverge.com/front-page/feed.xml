    <title>Microsoft’s new matte black Surface Go 3 launches with optional LTE connectivity</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LRRCY-kXCMbOSj_E7irMfKxfswE=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374630/surfacego3blacklte.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWWkGA"&gt;Microsoft is announcing a new matte black option of its Surface Go 3 today, with optional LTE connectivity. The announcement comes just a day after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876137/microsoft-surface-go-3-matte-black-leak-images"&gt;images of the new Surface Go 3 model leaked online&lt;/a&gt;, with a new matte black finish. The new color option and LTE connectivity are the only changes, as it’s identical to the regular Surface Go 3 otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5YBnY"&gt;Microsoft first launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;Surface Go 3 in September&lt;/a&gt;, with new Intel processor options. The Surface Go 3 can be configured with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y or Core i3-10100Y, upgrades over the Surface Go 2, which launched with a Pentium Gold 4425Y or a Core m3 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pJPk2g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now in Matte Black, our most portable Surface touchscreen 2-in-1 is perfect for your everyday tasks, homework, and play.&lt;/p&gt;— Microsoft Surface (@surface) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/surface/status/1480932520006873088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QEA1pQ"&gt;The matte black version of the Surface Go 3 is now available starting at $549.99, with an Intel Pentium Gold 6500Y processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. If you’re interested in the optional LTE, then you’ll need to step up to a Core i3 model that comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is priced at $729.99. A matching black Type Cover is also available for $99.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85SrPo"&gt;The new matte black models are &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Go-3%2F904H27D0CBWN%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f4c%26selectedColor%3D000000%26preview%3D%26previewModes%3D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available immediately&lt;/a&gt; in the US, UK, and other Surface markets. LTE versions of the Surface Pro 8 are also &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-8-for-Business%2F8X957CQQP1T4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available to businesses today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony Xperia 5 III now shipping in the US, almost nine months after initial announcement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YoS7oZk0NVKgSCFSQhWYKCyGe-U=/87x0:1022x623/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374527/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e3KHRc"&gt;Sony’s Xperia 5 III, the compact counterpart to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22580552/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;Xperia 1 III&lt;/a&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/sony-electronics-highly-anticipated-xperiar-5-iii-smartphone-now-shipping-in-the-united-states"&gt;now on sale in the US&lt;/a&gt;, almost nine months after the company initially announced the device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382887/sony-announces-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii"&gt;in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. The phone retails for $999.99 and will be available in black or green, with the latter exclusive to Sony’s own online store. The phone went on sale in the second half of last year in the UK and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktKLs8"&gt;The phone has seen some internal upgrades compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514064/sony-xperia-5-ii-review"&gt;Xperia 1 II&lt;/a&gt;, which bring it more into line with mainstream handsets from 2021. It’s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, runs Android 11 out of the box, and should also be able to benefit from at least some 5G connectivity in the US. Elsewhere, battery capacity has been upped to 4,500mAh, and Sony advertises that this larger battery can be charged to 50 percent in half an hour, like its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8e7JgyoV9gkitL48wARyEBuXEVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160681/auto.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tall display paired with three rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gjED2g"&gt;Externally the Xperia 5 III has a similar design to the Xperia 5 II. Its 120Hz 6.1-inch display maintains Sony’s trademark 21:9 aspect ratio, and there are still three rear 12-megapixel cameras, which handle main, ultrawide, and telephoto duties, respectively. There’s support for taking photos at up to 20fps, with focus / exposure readings happening at 60fps, as well as support for recording 120fps 4K footage in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvspRt"&gt;It’s a decent set of specs, and if the Xperia 1 III is anything to go by, the phone should have decent camera performance and a stunning screen. But $999 seems like a high price when, very soon, we’re going to start seeing phones releasing with Qualcomm’s newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8tB8"&gt;The Xperia 5 III is shipping now, and Sony says that orders placed before February 27th will come with a pair of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt; earbuds and 43,200 &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; CP points for free. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GameStop has Xbox Series X bundles for order right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYyML7jTlnEIS2cvCiHw3M6TywA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374466/vpavic_201103_4275_0196.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The monolithic Xbox Series X console is still a bit tricky to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LfYRnO"&gt;Another week, another restock of Xbox Series X consoles at GameStop. Hopefully this is a trend that new console availability is opening up in 2022 to a point where soon anyone will be able to walk into a store and pick up their hardware of choice without any fuss. While we’re not quite there yet, the restocks are remaining fairly consistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJl8WL"&gt;GameStop has two Xbox Series X console bundles today, offered on its website for shipping to US addresses — as opposed to some of the recent in-store restocks we have seen. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-far-cry-6-nba-2k22-accessories-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745R.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first bundle&lt;/a&gt; includes the Xbox Series X console, &lt;em&gt;Far Cry 6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K22&lt;/em&gt;, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $749.95. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fxbox-series-x%257Cs%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x-elite-controller-game-pass-ultimate-and-system-bundle-with-a-50-gamestop-gift-card%2FB224745S.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The second bundle&lt;/a&gt; has the Xbox Series X console paired with the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a $50 GameStop gift card for a total of $774.97.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk2OQM"&gt;This restock is not limited to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeconsolerestock010321&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fpoweruprewards%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop Pro subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, but be sure to create a basic account or sign in to your existing account on GameStop’s site to streamline the process with your purchase info filled out, and always keep in mind that patience and persistence is key. You may get an error or a sold out notification when adding to your cart, but keep refreshing the listing and trying as long as that Add to Cart button is still there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What comes after the smartphone, with Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-KMOx3Vj_kRlnLnf0uqQl7Cp0c=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374310/VRG_ILLO_Decoder_Cristiano_Amon_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cristiano Amon is optimistic about everything&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1EsE1a"&gt;Cristiano Amon is the president and CEO of Qualcomm, and he’s always been a relentless cheerleader for what mobile computing can do for people — especially if that mobile computing is powered by Qualcomm’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbFiCW"&gt;And Qualcomm’s chips are in basically everything: the company’s wireless chips are in virtually every phone — actually every 5G phone — and its Snapdragon processors are in every major Android phone. Then it has businesses in cars, servers, VR headsets — you name it. The company is everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ixdnu"&gt;But relentless optimism can only get you so far — like everyone else, Qualcomm is dealing with a supply chain crunch, a global pandemic, and skyrocketing demand for chips that’s led to widespread shortages. On top of that, Apple’s A-series chips in the iPhone have long outperformed the Snapdragon line, and now the company’s M-series chips for Macs are upending the PC industry — a market Qualcomm still hasn’t really cracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biTec9"&gt;So I wanted to know how Cristiano is thinking about Qualcomm’s future six months into his run as CEO: What’s working? What’s not? Where does he have to make changes to compete? How long will this chip shortage actually last? This is a pivotal moment for the chip industry, and I wanted to really push on how Cristiano is thinking about getting through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnSXL8"&gt;I also wanted to push on something I’ve always wondered about: Qualcomm is basically the only company that’s shipping a 5G radio in the United States — Apple might eventually have one of its own, but right now, it’s all Qualcomm. How did that happen? And where does Cristiano see any actual competition coming from, if any? I thought his answer was very revealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ljvc8p"&gt;Okay, Cristiano Amon, the president and CEO of Qualcomm. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktcvkQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xb4tgI"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP7679646611" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YRsqA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cristiano Amon, you are the president and CEO of Qualcomm. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxayPQ"&gt;Very happy to be here and good talking to you. I think it’s been over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwHiLd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169567/vergecast-podcast-433-interview-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-airpods-max-ftc-facebook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We last spoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a year ago — when you were the president of Qualcomm. Now you are also the CEO. I have a lot of questions about what your plans for the company are, but I have an executive from one of the leading chip makers in the world on the show. I have to start with the chip shortage. How is it going? How has it impacted Qualcomm? When is it going to be over?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85mQ91"&gt;Oh, very good. Thanks for the question. Nice to see you too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0YXcL"&gt;Look, here’s the situation: this is one of the biggest supply chain crises we have had in chips, but also it’s because of something else; chips are now going everywhere. The percentage of digital in the economy is significantly higher. Virtually everything that’s being built now requires chips. I was talking with the folks in the Treasury Department about how there was a shift from services to goods during the pandemic. People buy more goods than services, and there are chips in all those goods. One thing we learned through the supply chain crisis — if I can say something that is positive of it — will be that chips are important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="0bXgkk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5EBE7a"&gt;There was an understanding of the importance of chips in our economy and the importance of semiconductor companies. As a result, a lot of companies that didn’t have a direct relationship with semiconductor companies started to forge those partnerships. It was a challenge for me, the first year as CEO. But it’s also an opportunity. I think we’ll be able to leverage on our assets of having a very large engineering capability to design our products across every available capacity out there in a very short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHLumr"&gt;We bet on ourselves because we believe in what our volumes are going to be and we make commitments and we put our scale to work. On one hand it was a big challenge, but also an opportunity. We are probably doing better than other companies. Our supply has increased significantly. As we begin 2022, some of the planning for capacity expansions that we put in place is starting to materialize. It got reflected in our guide for the next fiscal quarter, as well. So, the chip shortage is not over yet, but things are getting much better as we go to the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZys6c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you see the end?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsBRmY"&gt;Yeah. We have a very balanced supply and demand equation as we get to summer of 2022. I know the other companies are probably talking about 2023 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qTaFh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does Qualcomm manufacture its own chips or are you handling designs while someone else manufactures them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ze1uh4"&gt;We are one of the largest fab-less companies. We have never had a fab. We have outsourced the manufacturing of our chips since the beginning of our company. We work with pretty much everybody: TSMC, Samsung, Global Foundries, SMIC, UMC — all of the companies. To give you a technically correct answer, we do manufacture one thing. When you talk about material science and especially a very complex filter technology for 5G radio signals, we manufacture our own filters. We do that in Munich and in Austria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yny7q7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s fascinating, I didn’t know that. The reason I ask about manufacturing is, as I’ve talked to various executives about the chip shortage, they’ve all said things along the lines of what you just said: demand is really driving the shortage. People want more stuff. Everything has a chip in it now. The capacity wasn’t there. Then there were some COVID-related impacts, but it’s the manufacturing capacity that has to catch up to demand. That’s the end of the chip shortage for real. Are you investing in any of that manufacturing capacity? Are you partnering with any of those companies you mentioned? How does that work for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHu3nL"&gt;We’re investing indirectly. In our volume, we are very comfortable making long-term commitments in co-investing with our foundry partners to make sure capacity is there for us. Some of that started to materialize in decisions we made early on. We took action very quickly in the supply chain crisis. Some of that is already coming to fruition as we enter 2022. We’re indirectly investing as we make commitments. We invest together with our partners who are putting money down. Because of that, we secured a significant amount of capacity for Qualcomm in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0Tx07"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last question on this: there’s a lot of interest in making sure that manufacturing capacity is distributed around the world, particularly here in the United States. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TSMC is building a plant here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. There’s lots of interest in building a plant here. Is that something you’re directly involved in? Are you waiting to see what the actual fabs do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Qu9I0"&gt;Absolutely. This is a very important topic for me. Maybe I’ll just share something with you about a couple weeks ago. I was elected chairman of the SIA — the United States Semiconductor Industry Association — for this upcoming year. In that capacity, working with my colleagues in the SIA, two of our priorities are to make sure we get the CHIPS Act funded and get the FABS Act enacted. We advocate strongly for a geo-diversified, resilient supply chain. This is so important for the economy. I think we know that right now — whether it’s the auto industries or anything else you buy — chips are very important for our economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ixgRQP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We needed to make sure that we have resilient, geo-diversified investments in the United States of foundries.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QAHRn4"&gt;We needed to make sure that we have resilient, geo-diversified investments in the United States of foundries. It’s very important. Even new players — when Intel indicated they would like to be a foundry, we raised our hand and said, “We’ll work with them,” and we’re engaged with them as well. We work with anybody. On top of that, I actually really like the current discussions there have been between the Europeans and the United States. They’re both trying to solve the same problem and work in coordination. I don’t think one company or one region will be able to solve all of our demands for semiconductors, but we have to do something now to make sure we have a resilient supply chain for the next decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NlHQz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When discussing the chip shortage and the supply chain, people have generally known that we have needed a more resilient, diversified supply chain for quite some time. Then COVID hit and now there’s a real incentive to get that built. Is that your experience too — that everyone has known this is a problem, but it hasn’t been taken seriously until recently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAqIgr"&gt;Yes, we have known that semiconductors will continue to grow. It’s not that I want to basically say Qualcomm has done great, but we knew about this. Compared to all of our peers, we’re probably one of the few companies that really diversified our leading node needs. We have been using TSMC and Samsung for many years. We split our business between two. We have multi-sourcing for exactly this reason. The latest and greatest technology would be designed for both Samsung and TSMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ9N5i"&gt;But I agree with you that this shortage brought this issue to the surface. A lot of companies — especially in the auto industry — didn’t even understand there were semiconductors in their chain. They became very aware of this. I think there’s now a real push to get this resolved, so I kind of agree with that view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOk2MM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting. When I’ve spoken to car CEOs, it’s like a revelation that they were so dependent on chips. They’ve all been telling me their cars are turning into smartphones for like five years now, but I think that moment of clarity finally hit. I wanted to start there because I know we have limited time and I didn’t want to get away from those questions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClBxhE"&gt;No problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yp7JZ3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s start at the beginning now: you are the new CEO of Qualcomm. This is a new role for you. You were the president of Qualcomm before. What has changed for you now that you’re the CEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlmOuR"&gt;When I became president, I was responsible for my semiconductor business, and back in 2018, I started putting the strategy and the execution together to diversify the company. I saw there was an incredible opportunity for technology in many different end markets. We have always been a company focused on mobile — that will never change. We will continue to be successful in mobile, but we had incredible opportunities for Qualcomm across a number of different markets. When I became CEO, it was an opportunity to really solidify that vision and clearly communicate it to not only the entire company and all of our partners, but also to the market. Since I got the CEO job, I’ve been preparing for our investor day that we did three to four weeks ago in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsIr1e"&gt;There are a lot of things about Qualcomm that are important to be understood. We cannot be defined by a single end market and a single customer relationship. There’s a lot more to Qualcomm than that. We now have relevant technologies for so many end markets — we are becoming a company that is powering the edge. We unveiled that our addressable market can grow by 7 times, to $700 billion just within the next decade. That’s what changed. It’s the responsibility of being president and CEO to execute on one of the largest opportunities in the company’s history — and yes, I do feel the weight of that responsibility on my shoulders, but I’m excited about the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uSmTe6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it execution or did you change the strategy at all?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8yJlq"&gt;I won’t say we changed the strategy, but it’s more than execution. It’s the ability to build this vision: go bigger, faster. Leverage our technology roadmap — which is becoming very relevant because mobile technology is going everywhere —and quickly invest in the technologies that we need to execute in this vision. This wasn’t what I wanted to do after only 15 days on the job, but I had to put in a competing public bidding offer for the Arriver asset for ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems]. As soon as I got named CEO, I made the acquisition of a company called Nuvia because we wanted to have the best CPU team in the market. We believe we do. We wanted to be able to build brand new relationships with new customers in the US and with new markets. That’s all part of this set of activities. You can call it execution, but I think we are definitely in a hurry because the opportunities are right in front of us. We want to execute on it as fast as we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbyIq1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people work at Qualcomm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCJ3J7"&gt;It’s on the order of about 50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UXFe6h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where are they mostly located?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyyEqW"&gt;The majority are located in the United States, but we have presence everywhere. Just an example: we have over 10,000 employees in India. We have several thousands of employees across China, Korea, Japan, and Europe, so it’s a global company. It’s very diversified and we take pride in the areas that we’re really focused on, like technology across modems, wireless, high-performance computing, and low-power devices. We just look where we have found the best possible talent and we have been building in those locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zoXe9j"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s actually my next question. How is the company structured? How big is the modem division and the computing division? How do you think about that structure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lPeovs"&gt;Well, we don’t make some of those disclosures, but I’ll give you a—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xrRhx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a perfect time to make some of those disclosures.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XoCyRx"&gt;No, that’s good! &lt;em&gt;[Laughs.]&lt;/em&gt; I’ll give you a simple answer: engineers represent the absolute majority of our employee base. We’re a company grounded in a very strong engineering culture. It’s really one of the few companies that does fundamental R&amp;amp;D. That’s why we have so many essential patents — it’s because we focus on not only implementing new standards, but also creating them. We want to be really doing fundamental research. We made Snapdragon to power one of the most incredible mobile experiences, but we also put it into the Mars Helicopter and sent it to Mars. That’s a unique thing about the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dg2ZFf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We made Snapdragon to power one of the most incredible mobile experiences, but we also put it into the Mars Helicopter and sent it to Mars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zTZ7BZ"&gt;The majority of our employees are engineers and we’re focused on two areas. One area that we focus on is everything wireless communication. We know the last mile of data is wireless, whether it is cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth — everything high-performance computing for a battery powered device. That’s where you see us investing in CPU and DSPs — digital signal processors — and AI-processing GPU. The company structure is one where our engineers are divided for our mobile business, our auto business, our RF business, and this broad IoT that we presented in New York across consumer, networking, and enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9YnLZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the timelines those teams work on? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/5g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualcomm made huge investments in 5G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. We’re coming to sort of the mid-cycle of 5G. You have said 6G will be here by 2030, which is only eight years away. How far ahead are you making technology bets and investments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWaz2f"&gt;That’s a good question. We usually invest for a decade. I’ll give you a perfect example of this: we talked about connecting physical and digital spaces when it wasn’t popular. We started talking about virtual reality and augmented reality when it wasn’t popular. Some of the bets that we made over a decade led to incredible technology that enabled the Oculus Quest from Meta and HoloLens from Microsoft. Now people understand the potential of creating digital twins and talk about the metaverse. We’re the company making the devices that connect the physical world with the digital world and we started working on that about 10 years ago. Every generation of wireless — the moment we complete 5G, we start working on 6G. I think that’s something unique to Qualcomm. We probably have the largest percentage of our revenue dedicated to R&amp;amp;D. We start everything around 10 years in advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6gIOV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you rank your bets? Do you think, “Okay, we have to put some people in the AR and VR stuff, because we think that might happen. That’s pretty risky. 6G is definitely going to happen. That’s less risky. We can invest differently.” Do you prioritize your bets that way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csVBlZ"&gt;Oh, I have a perfect answer for you! When I just did our last investor day, when we talked about this new vision of Qualcomm, there’s a slide that I presented that laid out all the industry trends, and I said, “Nobody here is going to dispute with us that those are industry trends.” Here’s the answer to your question: one of the things that always helped me in my career — and I think that’s also part of Qualcomm — is the ability to understand some of those key trends that are happening ahead of time. That’s how we make priority calls. We invest in those disruptions. We invest in those trends. That’s how we make our bets and that’s how we stick with those bets. You may think that there’s too many things we’re doing right now, but we’re dealing with the one technology roadmap that we have and it’s all based on inevitable trends that we see in front of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crWEkM"&gt;I can name a few trends: the digital twins everywhere with the metaverse. The other trend is the full conversions between mobile and PC — how PCs are becoming communication devices. I’m sure what you and I are doing right now is a communication use case for your device. This is how we think about creating smart devices connected to the cloud 100 percent of the time to enable digital transformation. It goes all the way to what’s going to happen with artificial intelligence: the artificial intelligence that we see today in the data center is just the tip of the iceberg. As you start to bring artificial intelligence to the devices, that’s an order of magnitude bigger. It’s almost like an unlimited addressable market. That’s how we make our bets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kuwXdv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything that you’ve ever made a bet on that you ultimately had to pivot out of, like 3D TVs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e22lY"&gt;Yeah, we have. Bad bets are just part of being in the technology industry. We have always been fortunate that we’ve been able to leverage R&amp;amp;D. I’ll give you two practical examples. At some point in time, we had this vision that TVs were going to converge with mobile. Just look at the use cases in your TV right now. You stream video now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxwoRY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TVs are basically giant Android tablets now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Brb2I"&gt;Giant Android tablets, yes. But we were too early — we needed to support the old and the new simultaneously. At the time, having to invest in a lot of legacy TV technologies wasn’t a great idea, so we pivoted out of the TV business and waited for the next opportunity. Another great example: we started working on data centers with ARM technology too early as well. While we had some assets, we focused on the future of what the data center is, moving at the edge. So we had high-performance computing for data center inference at the edge, but we really focused on the devices and everything was happening at the edge instead of the data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZB6haC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you on that logical next result from the data center. You mentioned mobile and PCs are going to converge and look more similar to each other than not. That is already happening. Qualcomm is on the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785181/qualcomm-next-gen-cpu-pc-apple-m1-competitor-2023"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;third generation of chips in PCs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Microsoft has released some devices that run Windows on Qualcomm processors. They haven’t been a hit, so I wouldn’t say those ventures have been a huge success. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bKcdp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meanwhile, Apple is a competitor and partner of yours. They have just shifted their entire laptop line to their own ARM-based chips, which has been a success. Apple has had a performance lead in mobile for a while now, as well as a performance lead over Intel in PCs. What’s it going to take for you to compete there? We’ve seen a lot of generations of these chips; we’re kind of waiting for the big inflection point.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW6nN8"&gt;This is a great question. That’s the reason you see a lot of generations — we start early. If you look at what’s happening right now, we knew that PCs needed to evolve into what we call next-generation PCs. When you buy a phone, you take the phone out of the box and you expect it to be connected regardless. Why is it any different for PCs? Also, as you start to move more and more things to the cloud, PCs being a connected device with high-performance connectivity is kind of a necessity.  When we started doing this partnership with Microsoft, we knew that we needed to do a very big change — especially for the Windows ecosystem, which is very strong in the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkcoBi"&gt;We needed to pull off a massive change to an established software ecosystem on x86, to ARM. When that will take multiple generations — case in point is Windows 11. Right now, Microsoft can support 64-bit apps’ emulation on ARM. Prior generations have still been able to run some of the applications, but they still didn’t have the full capability of Windows. This is completely transparent to the user. That had an impact on how much volume we could ramp. Our expectation at the time was that it would take multiple generations to build the ecosystem around ARM. Apple gave us an incredible tailwind. They just built more to scale, to the point that now all the developers are saying that they are going to develop ARM first. Just look at a company like Adobe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Um2CkN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple gave us an incredible tailwind... to the point that now all the developers are saying that they are going to develop ARM first.“&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vRyBjr"&gt;On top of this, we had another tailwind: the future of work as we went into the pandemic, as well as gaming becoming a streaming service on PC. You had to change an entire ecosystem from a PC architecture to a mobile architecture. I think we’re just getting to that inflection point, so it’s not a surprise for Qualcomm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9Ss1W"&gt;If you look at what we have done in the past, we’ve never made heroic assumptions as a company. You didn’t see me making claims like, “Hey, the PC’s going to be this much percent of our revenue.” By that time, we knew we needed to switch an entire ecosystem — but we wanted to do it right and do it in a way that we’re going to win it. Look at the work that Apple has done for their products with the DM Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6x3ui"&gt;The transition to ARM is now inevitable. There’s no debate: 5G is going to come to your PC. If you’re now a flexible workspace employee with a huge workstation doing computer-aided design, you’re not going to carry that in a backpack. You’re going to have to do that on the cloud using 5G. Companies are getting all the data, moving to Microsoft OneDrive and other cloud drives. People collaborate with tools like Teams and Zoom. Streaming of gaming is coming — that transition’s inevitable. If you look at every company out there who has the assets to actually make this happen for the Windows ecosystems, that’s us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3nLG2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me push you, though.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAtllI"&gt;Please do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUjyfG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The use cases you’ve described — the way that would be executed is almost what would be called a thin client model in the old days. You’ve got a big data center and a fast 5G connection — which, happily, Qualcomm has a lot of IP related to. That’s great for you. You’ve got devices with 5G modems; Qualcomm makes a lot of 5G modems, and then you’re streaming the games. You’re sharing the data over OneDrive. Those applications aren’t processor-intensive. Maybe you’re doing CAD over some sort of thin client, but you’re not doing a lot of heavy duty processing on it. Apple’s innovation is that their clients are wicked fast. Does Qualcomm see the ability to leap over Apple’s performance advantage — both in phones and on the desktop?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycsmND"&gt;Great question. I have two answers for you. Let me start in reverse order. When we talk about, “What are we doing in PCs?” We’ve been investing and waiting for this moment to have an inflection point. We’re going to have that with Windows 11. We’re investing to have the benchmark performance of PCs across the CPU, their own device AI, and the GPU. So to date, our products have been focused on leveraging mobile as the focus on a consumer device. They will have like a two-in-one — an evolution of the tablet. You can think about how we probably can compete with an iPad within the Windows ecosystem. That’s what we’ve done today. Understandably, there were limitations on the software to be able to go to the enterprise, but not anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VBMzd"&gt;That’s the reason we bought Nuvia: we think it is the best CPU team, and you should expect Qualcomm aiming to take the leadership position in performance. We’re going to have to execute it. Our first product was going to sample next year. It’s going to be commercial in 2023. We’ve been public about it, and people will be able to measure it. We’re aiming to have that benchmark of performance in this industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwlIIf"&gt;Here’s the second part of your question: computing on these devices is changing dramatically. Let’s just give an example on artificial intelligence. This is where I think you’re going to see Qualcomm shine because you cannot do those things on the CPU. You need dedicated hardware. Think about this: you are working with me, doing this Zoom meeting with me right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5edPKC"&gt;Your camera is always ready: looking at you and looking at everything else around you. All of a sudden, somebody shows up right behind you, looking over your shoulder. The camera can immediately detect and activate a private screen. The camera can also track your eyes and make sure you’re looking into its lens at all times with artificial intelligence. It can do facial recognition. On top of that, you’re going to have split rendering. As you get mainstream gaming into the device, you need to have the performance on the GPU to process all that while you’re streaming. I don’t think computation of requirements are going down even as you do things on the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8IiLB"&gt;Frankly speaking, there are a couple things that hold true in all of my multiple decades of experience working for Qualcomm — two things hold true. I’ve never heard anybody say, “Okay, now my internet speed is fast enough. I don’t want to go any faster.” I’ve never heard that. I’ve also never heard, “I don’t want a faster processor for the next generation.” So I think we’re going to be in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPB9Kd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s a question I’ve been dying to ask: you recently announced your newest chip, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. You changed the name of the Snapdragon line. The previous chip was the Snapdragon 888. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is not a great name. Why the change? Why do all chip makers tend to have these extremely difficult names?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoPtnC"&gt;It’s an awesome name. The explanation is super simple: Snapdragon became synonymous with premium Android experiences. It’s kind of reflected in the consumer; a big market like China, for example, has 80 percent awareness of the Snapdragon brand. Snapdragon’s flagship release was the 8 Series. You have to go generation to generation: you use numbers, but at the end of the day there is an incredible identity of 8 Series Snapdragon consumers. When a consumer buys a phone — especially in markets where the customer base really cares about what’s in their device — they’ll ask, “Does this have the latest Snapdragon 8 Series?” We’re just simplifying the brand. There’s more happening than just 8 Gen 1. We also used to be Qualcomm Snapdragon, but we simplified the brand to just Snapdragon. Everybody recognized that red fireball as a Snapdragon. It’s just simple. Single-digit eight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPqff4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gen 1.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNBRNj"&gt;The next year after will be Gen 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFIRK4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See, you made some news. You announced a future product. I’ve never gotten a CEO to announce a future product. That’s great.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aldEt7"&gt;Every year we have a new Snapdragon. That’s not going to change either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yr15nj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about your future chip roadmap: the purchase of Nuvia, which is great on the CPU side. There’s also a lot of action on the GPU side of things in chips. Do you have a roadmap to compete with the Nvidias and the AMDs of the world on the graphics pipeline?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVcvQv"&gt;Here’s how you should think about Qualcomm: we have been doing GPUs for the phone space, and then we’re evolving into the auto space. We always had the highest performance per watt for the industry. What is good about GPU is, once you have the technology, it’s highly scalable. It’s parallel processing. You can scale up and down. We’re going to new end markets: automotive, the digital chassis. We’re going into the full market of the PC. You’re going to see the Qualcomm GPU scaling up and being extremely competitive. We ship probably more GPUs than anybody else because we do it on phones. GPUs are a technology that we’re very proud of and we’re very excited about what we’re going to be able to show as we get into the competitive PC space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWA1PJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the timeline of that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1yBFh9"&gt;The first PC chip with new technologies is going to sample in 2022 for devices launching in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3bg2Ke"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m curious: it seems like Qualcomm is the only company that can ship a 5G radio in the United States. Apple bought Intel’s business, but they haven’t shipped anything. I think they’re still using your modems. How did Qualcomm end up in the position where it dominates the entire market for 5G radios in the United States? Where are we on the curve? Is it fast enough? Are you seeing the promise of 5G? So far it seems like a lot of the promised applications have not really come to pass.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdQ6Eo"&gt;Let me start with the promise of 5G first. It’s always music to my ears when I hear that. I remember in the 4G era, people said, “What am I going to do with this technology until the smartphones show up?” And you put a computer in their hands. Now we have a very mature society that sees the value of cellular. People say, “Why am I not getting it today?” That’s awesome. This is a very good position to be in. The problem with 5G is that it takes a bit of time to build the infrastructure. We’ve done better on the device side, but with infrastructure, you have to densify the network. You need more cell towers. As a result, it takes longer to build than the initial buildout where you just could put new equipment in the existing tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDr053"&gt;You need to get new cell towers and get new permits. It’s happening on a global scale. The number of carriers investing globally in 5G and densifying the network — it’s happening. It just takes a little bit more time. It’s very clear that we’re going to get there. As we start making use of some of the new frequencies of 5G, like the millimeter wave frequencies, you’re going to have gigabit speeds in every device. That’s going to make a difference. From a technology standpoint, we went to a summit in Hawaii two weeks ago. It’s the show where we always announce our product lineup. We did the world’s first: 3.5 gigabit per second uplink. I actually did a live call with Verizon wireless from the event. By the way, the YouTubers in the audience were cheering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7t72r"&gt;This type of uplink on this magnitude could improve a lot of things. Social media will change: people can broadcast themselves. Some will like it, and some won’t. I just talked about YouTube. We think about the ability to access computational resources on the cloud and collaborate on documents — all those things. I think that’s going to bring a lot of developers onboard, so it’s just a matter of time. We’re starting to see changes already in user behavior. We’re moving towards unlimited data rates everywhere. Wi-Fi is going to be everywhere: unlimited data rates, high speeds, high uplink speeds and the developer ecosystem is just the beginning of that ramp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60hHq0"&gt;The last part of that question: I don’t like the word dominant, but the way I would argue—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsnJQB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could imagine that.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPt6yA"&gt;We’re very focused on this. This is one of the main things we do for a living. We always have done more. Qualcomm is “quality communications” — that’s our name. We have been the leader in every single generation of wireless. It’s not a coincidence: we invest, we have one of the best teams, and we always raise the bar. As long as wireless communications remain important, there will always be room for Qualcomm. We’re always going to be first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGEOAJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are your biggest competitors in modems in the United States?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sX19Se"&gt;We have competitors everywhere. For example, Apple said that they’re going to develop their own modem. When out in New York, we basically said, “Look, we’re assuming that the iPhone will launch in 2023 with their own modem and Qualcomm will then supply only 20 percent of those modems.” Let me give you some data points. Usually when you launch a product, you need commercial software and hardware for the device about one year before it gets to the shelf. We’re assuming that they’re going to have their modem and they’re going to have all the capabilities, including the millimeter wave. That’s our projection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OShGKa"&gt;People sometimes ask the question — you didn’t ask this time — “Why don’t you build your own foundry?” It’s because we’re not good at that. We’re good at building chips and designing chips. We’re not good at foundry, but sometimes customers want us to do everything. This is not news to us. We always had Samsung, for example, who had their own modem and their own chip, but over the years, I think the Qualcomm relationship with Samsung has remained stable. Right now, it is on an upswing trajectory. We keep focused on doing what we do best and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K8LMLW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But my iPhone 13 Pro Max — long name — has a Qualcomm modem in it right now.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMOf1z"&gt;Good for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MqXPa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, Apple isn’t shipping the others. Are there any phones in the market that don’t have Qualcomm modems in the United States?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6sYkW"&gt;I would imagine you’re going to find that some of the entry-level prepaid phones in the United States don’t have Qualcomm modems. Here’s what makes the United States very unique: it’s a very safe cellular environment compared to what you see in some other countries. The operator in the United States will test all the phones and make sure that they meet the latest standards and that they’re compatible with the network. They make a selection on the technology that goes into the phones they put on their shelf. As a result, I think the US operators always select the best-performing modem available. When you go to emerging markets, sometimes the OEM controls the channel; there’s a channel that sells consumer electronics and the operator has no control over it. Maybe that’s the difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZiOUq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason I ask is because Qualcomm just made a phone — the first phone I’ve seen directly from your company, called the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. It’s very much not meant to compete at mass scale, I don’t think, but I’m curious: you didn’t build a foundry, so why make a phone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGXBH3"&gt;No, it’s not. We don’t make phones. That phone was designed by Asus. It’s been designed to a special set of specifications just to highlight some of the capabilities of the Qualcomm processor. It was a limited-production device, only for Snapdragon Insiders. As we grow into a mature smartphone society, people care what’s behind the glass. Phones are the number one consumer electronic purchase decision for many users. It’s remarkable how educated consumers are right now on technology; they want to know the capabilities of the processor. We’re positively surprised to see how many fans exist out there for Snapdragon. We created this Insider program, and it’s been incredibly successful: multiple millions of users in a very short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEqCqD"&gt;We probably announced that we are approaching — if not exceeded — 4 million users since we launched. We built it with Asus, the same company that built the Republic of Gamers device. They built a device just for the Insiders that highlights Snapdragon. We’re not in the phone business. We have a horizontal platform that enables collaboration, and that’s why we have been successful. I have always believed that the horizontal model is going to be better than the vertical model: you don’t have only one company doing all the innovation. You can pool the collective innovation of all the companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycYZOY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Snapdragon phone highlights the chip and its capabilities because you would sell that chip to some phone maker who would add their differentiation. That phone maker would either opt to use your features or not, and then they would have to go to a carrier — &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; covers how the carriers interfere in phone design quite closely — they would make some decisions. Getting your innovations directly to consumers is challenging, so you can build the phone and then sell it directly to some set of Snapdragon fans and show them all the things you’re working on.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCO9Yt"&gt;The intention was to build the phone to show some of the capabilities of the chip. When a phone gets built, one of the decisions that OEMs make is how many different frequency bands you’re going to put in the phone. And you say, “This phone is going to go to this market. I’m going to put all the frequency bands that are required by this carrier, maybe some extra for roaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AUyGm"&gt;One of the things we did with that phone was include every frequency band known to mankind. We installed every single band. It’s going to work everywhere across every operator. Once we build every new chip, there’s something that we do which is called the MTP. I think the engineers that are familiar with this probably know about the MTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ka9krf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For every single new chip at Qualcomm we produce, we build a phone.“&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEpt1p"&gt;For every single new chip at Qualcomm we produce, we build a phone. It’s called the mobile task platform: a phone that we ship to our customers so that they can start developing their software as they build their own phone. One of the secrets people don’t know about Qualcomm is that with every new chip we make, we build the phone ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuY0u3"&gt;There are two types of devices. One is the MTP that is a little bigger. It has a lot of probes that people can put in to get data in from the device. The other one is called the QRD — the Qualcomm Reference Design. It looks like a phone. We take that phone and test it across every corner of the globe. We validate the technology so it performs at its best. That’s one of the things we’re doing with the Insiders: just giving them a phone that is the Qualcomm gold standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pi5iYT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phones are interesting. I think there’s a very good argument that the smartphone is the most important new product in the history of technology, maybe through all of history. Everyone on Earth has a phone, and is going to buy another phone in two years. Mobile phones are the biggest tech market I can think of. Is there another market like that in your future that you can identify? Is it AR and VR, or is it just lots of new markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGTyP"&gt;Of course there is another market. I know we talk a lot about phones, but the story of Qualcomm right now is very different. Yes, there is a huge phone opportunity — we’re going to be there. The technology we develop for the phone market is changing the automobile and the PC, as well as VR and AR devices. It’s shifting how you approach the home with enterprise transformation. We’re changing the Wi-Fi access point in the home. Smart IoT devices are changing the enterprise in a very big way, and that’s kind of reflected in the plan for Qualcomm going forward. And it’s not just a plan— if you look at what we did at the end of this fiscal year, the market was surprised. I think they were so obsessed with examining Qualcomm’s relationship with Apple that they were not seeing what else was happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0O3zSu"&gt;We had over $10 billion of non-handset revenue. That sector now represents 38 percent of Qualcomm revenues. I think that’s a sign that not only is there opportunity, but that this growth is already happening at scale. I think we have a number of bets that could be as big as phones. I’ll give an example of one that is more futuristic, but will happen eventually. As augmented reality becomes more pervasive, I can see that we are going to buy a set of glasses, which will be a companion for your phone for a while. That’s going to last for a long time until the glasses become standalone. While you would argue that maybe humans won’t use a big helmet, they will use something like regular glasses. You can put cameras on it. You can render things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyq7uR"&gt;Here is a simplistic way to describe this to you: all of a sudden we started to see iPads and we started to see Android tablets. All of a sudden you have to render any given application in a different way on a bigger screen. You can start with something as simple as rendering some applications or notifications. In addition to that screen, your phone’s going to render to your glasses — augmented reality. Then you get information from the glasses that will create a new set of applications. I think augmented reality glasses can grow to be as important as phones, and will start as a companion to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnPaQn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me ask you this question that I ask everybody about AR glasses. I already know what the killer app for AR glasses is. It’s the thing I want the most: I want to look at somebody that I’ve met before and have the glasses tell me their name, because I’m horrible at faces and names. That’s it. I think you could probably sell that product to everybody in the world. How do you build that application without building a worldwide facial recognition database?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NI3K3V"&gt;Look, there’s many more applications than that one. Let me—&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhvyJo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But that’s the killer app.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U1noJ"&gt;There’s more. I think there’s more killer apps than that. Let me try to give you another choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVsU6Y"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But answer that question: can you build that application?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWoEEX"&gt;I think it’s possible to build that application and you can do that application in many different ways. For example, you could build an application that’s going to be useful for you. There’s going to be a camera in your glasses. You see somebody’s face, you go to the cloud, and search what’s publicly available on LinkedIn, on Facebook, on Instagram, and you just compare and contrast. The device prompts you with some choices for you in the same way that it works today. When you have somebody’s name, you can go online and figure out: “Do I know this person or not?” At the end of the day, you can build this in many different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktuPsi"&gt;Let’s talk about a different application of the glasses that has been incredible: education. If you’re in a classroom, you can superimpose images on your glasses. With virtual reality you can go to different places. You can watch how an event happened if you’re studying history. You can be in a virtual classroom. We have been tackling this issue with every generation of wireless: how do people communicate? When we started with 2G cellular, the big question was the capacity of CDMA: can we make sure that everybody has the ability to have a cell phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZ6wMS"&gt;Every individual on earth can have a telephone. That was 2G cellular. You started to see the beginning of data. With that came things like email and everybody holding onto their Blackberries, so you now have two ways of communicating. You’ll be able to talk to somebody, and you can also text or send an email. 4G is a whole different ball game. When you look at what we have right now with 4G, people are making fewer and fewer voice calls. Then something happened: it took a pandemic to finally create video telephoning as the killer app. People have been trying to chase that since the early days of 3G: “Oh, the killer app is going to be video telephoning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7e0par"&gt;It didn’t really materialize back then. It took a pandemic, but now it’s the killer app — so much so that when people get a video call, they’re holding their phones right in front of their faces. It’s actually changing behavior. You hold your phone with your hands to text, or you hold it in front of your face to have a video call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtysHW"&gt;Here’s how you could have a voice call with glasses: a friend calls you, and you could render that person right in front of you. That’s one other way to think about applications on the metaverse: you can have a hologram or a telepresence of somebody in front of you. You have sensors in the glasses that detect your face movements with artificial intelligence. You can render yourself to the other person without a camera looking at you. We have the ability to fundamentally change how we’re going to communicate with each other as we take advantage of those new technologies. That could be a killer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IlLYC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you invested in the display side of these glasses? I’m very curious what display technology will win out for these glasses right now. We just had &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832490/niantic-ceo-john-hanke-metaverse-pokemon-go-ar-vr-podcast-decoder-interview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Hanke from Niantic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — Qualcomm has built a reference design with them. Waveguide displays; that’s what we see everywhere. Do you think that’s it, or do you think there’s some other possibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6BYoMd"&gt;Our model is the same thing. I would argue we have one of the best image signal processors in the industry for cameras. That’s why we always have the highest DxOMark score: we partner with image sensor companies like Sony and with Samsung. I think that would be the same display. We’re going to partner and do co-development to put them in the reference designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NEzQT"&gt;Display technology is getting there. It’s probably lagging a little behind some of the silicon and processing for some of the applications. We see a roadmap to get that done. It’s fair to think that within the next four to five years, we’re going to have devices that are going to be doing exactly what we just discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c70ccZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there’s a consumer device in four to five years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDaLWy"&gt;I think so. We have consumer devices available now, but given the maturity of the technology, it would take around that long to get to that type of killer application that you and I just talked about. I think that’s very realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TW8Zx8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last silly question. I feel like we talk about the metaverse — AR, VR — a lot as an industry trend. The other industry trend that is somewhat connected to it is crypto, NFTs. Do you personally own any crypto or NFTs? Is Qualcomm making any company bets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC1k8o"&gt;It’s not a silly question at all. One of the incredible things that we announced: the new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 now has the ability to mint and generate NFTs. We always believe in smartphone technology’s ability to enable the users. You have artists creating digital content and you can now mint and create your NFT from your smartphone with Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. I think that’s going to enable incredible scaling of these new technologies. That’s an awesome feature by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R1QD4e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about you? Have you dabbled? Have you made any crypto purchases? Do you have any NFTs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFSHjP"&gt;No, I haven’t had time to do it. I’ve been busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7tzie"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The life of a new CEO. All right, Cristiano, that’s a great place to end it. Thank you so much for coming onto &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. I really enjoyed it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="sKNdqW"&gt;I love doing it. Thank you for the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belle director Mamoru Hosoda on creating a metaverse fairy tale</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Belle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CKyStQ10rTAapvg2XPniVlD4xU=/381x0:1668x858/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374211/BELLE_Image01.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The mind behind Summer Wars and Mirai discusses his latest anime feature  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="P5RtlP"&gt;When I sat down to chat with director Mamoru Hosoda over Zoom last November, it had only been a few weeks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;since Facebook had announced its name change&lt;/a&gt;, and everyone seemed to be talking about the metaverse. Hosoda, meanwhile, was promoting his latest film: &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt;, a modern reinterpretation of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; that just so happened to be set in a metaverse-like virtual world. “I certainly didn’t expect Facebook to change their name during our promotional campaign,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0E2RN"&gt;Hosoda is perhaps best known for &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18117959/mirai-review-mamoru-hosoda-girl-who-leapt-through-time"&gt;his 2018 anime &lt;em&gt;Mirai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was nominated for best animated picture at the Academy Awards. But he’s also been exploring the idea of virtual worlds for quite some time. He got his start directing with a pair of &lt;em&gt;Digimon&lt;/em&gt; movies, and in 2009 he released &lt;em&gt;Summer Wars&lt;/em&gt;, in which a rogue AI wreaks havoc on a virtual world. “That dynamism and excitement that surrounds this idea of the internet really caught me,” he says of his initial attraction to the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDFNDU"&gt;The internet has become virtually unrecognizable in the two decades since &lt;em&gt;Digimon Adventure&lt;/em&gt; debuted, and that’s evident in &lt;em&gt;Belle. &lt;/em&gt;The film&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;uses its classic inspiration as a way of exploring the dual lives people often live online, starring a shy young girl from a small village who becomes a world-famous singer inside of a sprawling virtual space known as U. (In a meta twist, you can follow her avatar &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/uworld_belle/"&gt;on Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2P6Rq"&gt;It’s a clever take on &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; — there’s also a mysterious, monstrous figure who is more than they seem — but more than that, &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt; is a poignant story about our always-online culture, tackling difficult subjects like cyberbullying. And for Hosoda it was a chance not only to update a fairy tale he long admired, but also to update his vision of what a global virtual world might one day look like. U is an almost overwhelming space filled with skyscrapers and the avatars of a staggering 5 billion users, which has become the kind of virtual town square that Jack Dorsey could only dream of. Think of it like Times Square crossed with a round of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; and you’re almost there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajk0d2"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Belle&lt;/em&gt; coming to theaters in the US this week, here’s my conversation with Hosoda about the movie, the evolution of his ideas about the internet, designing the virtual realm U, and where the metaverse might go from here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="usjHkt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This isn’t your first time tackling these subjects and themes. What is it that keeps you coming back to stories about virtual worlds and the internet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru13t8"&gt;I recall creating movies that have to do with the theme of the internet all the way back to about 2000, with &lt;em&gt;Digimon Adventure: Our War Game&lt;/em&gt;. And I was fascinated by this idea that something aside from our own reality, these big events or phenomena that occur in this space can in some way, shape, or form affect our reality as we understand it. At the time the internet seemed like this very young space that was for a younger generation, and I felt like it had this almost hope of younger kids breaking these old values that we had and creating a new world. That dynamism and excitement that surrounds this idea of the internet really caught me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMQEqe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot has happened in the last 20 years with the way the internet functions, and a lot of these things that were science fiction then are now becoming reality. How have your feelings about the space changed? Do you have the same sense of optimism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDHwgi"&gt;Certainly the internet has changed massively in the last 20 years. One of the biggest changes, or shifts, I believe is this idea that we all interact with the internet in some way. Regardless of your age group or demographic, the internet affects your life. Because of that, our reality, and this other reality that exists in the internet world, have become much closer in the last 20 years than it was when the internet was much younger. We’ve carried a lot of our issues into the internet space; the toxicity, a lot of negativity. Because of that a lot of parents say, “Well the internet is bad” and they might take their kid’s iPad away and say, “We don’t want you on the internet.” But it’s not necessarily the internet that’s bad, I believe, it’s some of the more negative sides of us as a species that has manifested itself in this space. The issue isn’t so much the internet but us as humans, and how this anonymity changes us and changes behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4G1Am"&gt;But in spite of this, I think some elements of the internet remain unchanged, and this idea that the younger generation is always going to find a new way to take advantage of it to innovate and push the status quo further. I think there’s still some hope there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvsA8E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Belle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, what was the starting point? Did you want to explore this topic again and the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty and the Beast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;story fit well, or did you start with reinterpreting the story and this metaverse concept came from there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3d85v"&gt;I always admired the story of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, even when I was much younger. So I would say the idea of reinterpreting &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; came first. What really fascinated me about this story is how the values seemed to be inverted in some ways; what we think is pretty turns out to be ugly, and what might look ugly turns out to be quite beautiful on the inside. I’ve wanted to make my interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; for 30 years now. It took me 30 years to do it, but we’re finally here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fxZGu"&gt;In terms of how to tell that narrative, I realized this idea of the internet really worked well with the concept of &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; in that they both share this duality in some sense. In &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, the beast obviously has this very vicious and violent-looking exterior, but what’s inside is quite different. In a similar way, with the invention of the internet, we as people have the version of ourselves that exists in reality and another projection that exists in the internet. So there’s a similar duality happening, and I thought that would allow the narrative, and a lot of those themes, to work and come forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="ffHybL"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A0tORZayURs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="REieFA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what was the hold up? Was it just finding the right way to tell this story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36mVbV"&gt;In some of my past works, I did try to explore certain concepts from &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, but this is the first time I really consciously took it to this level and said, “This is a direct inspiration.” Take, for example, &lt;em&gt;Wolf Children&lt;/em&gt;, where we have a wolf man falling in love with a woman, or more recently &lt;em&gt;Boy and the Beast&lt;/em&gt;, which is sort of like a &lt;em&gt;Beauty and the Beast&lt;/em&gt; story told through a father and son. I think there have been a few iterations in my filmography where I try to explore the issue, but I would say this is the first time I really went for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWpsVL"&gt;Another reason why it took 30 years is that a lot of the shifts that happened around us in the world — we can go back to Disney’s interpretation from 30 years ago, or trace it back even further to 1946 when Jean Cocteau did his interpretation, or back even further to the original works — there have been a lot of changes in our society, and I felt the interpretation had to be similarly updated for a different audience and a different social context. The definition of beauty for me seemed much different if you trace it back to the original work, which was a very specific idea of beauty and a very male-dominated perspective. There seemed to be only a few ways that women could check all of the boxes of what it meant to be beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnUcDU"&gt;In Disney’s version 30 years ago, I think they really explored the idea of the duality of the beast. But today, I think that duality goes further and applies very much to this concept of beauty where the protagonist has to overcome certain obstacles to gain strength and almost feed strength to herself, and in many ways the way that she exerts this strength is in and of itself a very beautiful sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrEds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With U, the virtual world in the movie, what was it like figuring out how that would look and function? Were you aiming for something that felt plausible, that viewers could relate to with all of the tech they use in their lives, or were you going for something more futuristic and sci-fi?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99osJW"&gt;In the last 20 years, I think the internet has certainly changed a lot, and if you look at some of my earlier movies — &lt;em&gt;Digimon&lt;/em&gt; in 2000 and &lt;em&gt;Summer Wars&lt;/em&gt; in 2009 — when trying to visually express what’s inside this concept of the internet, I chose a much more white backdrop with a lot of colors that popped. It felt very inviting, it felt very vast and incomplete, like it was the frontier. A blank canvas, if you will. It wasn’t a space just for boys, it was open to women, younger generations, anyone who had something to contribute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHAxRT"&gt;But, as we talked about before, the internet has shifted quite a bit and become much closer to reality. So when thinking about how to express that, capture that in a visual medium, we ended up with what you see in U, which is this space that doesn’t necessarily have an up or a down, a left or a right. It’s packed with these skyscraper-like structures. It feels a little more cramped. Not quite as open as it did in my previous films. It really feels like the center of this world, and it’s hard to tell where the horizon starts and where it ends. That was the visual translation of what I felt the internet has evolved into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVTwQo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that how you feel when you go on the internet? Just overwhelmed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGlyvN"&gt;I perhaps don’t feel as excited as I did once upon a time, when I’d go on the internet to search for something and there was this sense of discovery or finding something new that I haven’t felt in a long time. It certainly has lost that sense of being a frontier, or this really vast open space, though perhaps the metaverse will fill that void and become the new frontier. I do feel a little sorry for the younger generations because it is unfortunate that there isn’t as much of a frontier, and there needs to be some kind of revolution, I suppose, in the internet space for these generations to continue to push innovation and the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Belle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGdY6P2NdChz0dGAcU8J_zZQ7DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144277/BELLE_Image04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GKIDS&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fBm2wO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you look at these metaverses or virtual worlds — the ones that exist now or the ones that companies are talking about building in the future — they’re always very commercially driven. They’re plastered with ads and things to buy. There’s not a lot of that in U, aside from some mentions of sponsorship. I’m curious if that was intentional, and why you decided to go in that direction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Okinqm"&gt;The internet is in many ways this new global world, and I think it is a representation of what a global world might look like, where languages and borders don’t play as much of a role anymore. U is intended to really capture that sensibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3oPS9"&gt;But in some ways this idea of a true globalized internet space, I question if it’s really possible, and that ties into the commercialism of it. Right now, the internet is really heavily influenced by Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Apple, the mega-corporations. They are global corporations in many ways, but at the same time they are very much Western, or US-based, companies that are managing what direction the internet is going. I do believe that we need some kind of entity or space or reality that can transcend the needs of the corporation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F94hbE"&gt;Even in U, the social media icons were part of this new U-verse. The various social media networks or corporations are then part of this platform, not the ones creating it. I do believe that leap needs to happen for us to have this globalized world that we envision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpK54d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has it been like promoting this movie about a global, virtual world and seeing all of those companies you just talked about saying, “We want to build one of our own”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3fz7OZ"&gt;I certainly didn’t expect Facebook to change their name during our promotional campaign. In some ways, I was trying to depict something that was slightly in the distance, but what seemed like fiction is very much becoming a reality. That shift is certainly quite interesting that it’s happening in real time, as this movie is propagating throughout the world. I think there is still a little ways to go in order to immerse yourself in a world without VR glasses, there’s still a bit of a gap, but I think the future seems to be headed in that direction. Perhaps a lot of the issues that were raised in the movie will come into play as we continue to make this transition. So hopefully it will speak to the audience in that way as we move into the next phase of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFVZMo"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Belle &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be screening in select IMAX theaters in the US on January 12th, before opening up more widely on January 14th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about 2022’s biggest chips from CES (and elsewhere)  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BA-qOvlIZpUM9jZivpdTDrd-cLY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374177/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yd7xYj"&gt;It’s a new year, and like clockwork, 2022 has brought with it a plethora of new chips for laptops, desktops, phones, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEs5sx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel announced new CPUs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866533/intel-12th-gen-cpu-alder-lake-mainstream-consumer-desktops-ces-2022"&gt;virtually every product it makes&lt;/a&gt;, AMD refreshed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;laptop processors&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;graphics cards&lt;/a&gt; for its whole lineup &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; started teasing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856151/amd-ryzen-7000-desktop-cpu-5nm-next-gen-zen-4-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;its next major desktop overhaul&lt;/a&gt;, and Nvidia came out swinging with the announcement of its most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;powerful GPU yet&lt;/a&gt;. If you weren’t keeping up (or even if you were) it was a &lt;em&gt;lot.&lt;/em&gt; And that was just CES: Qualcomm already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809687/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-chip-smartphone-processor-specs-details"&gt;announced &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; next-gen chips&lt;/a&gt; for smartphones and laptops in December, and Samsung is teeing up a new Exynos processor, too. And that’s not even considering Apple, which tends to play its cards closer to its chest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWkn4I"&gt;But as the dust settles and products with that plethora of processors start to loom on the horizon, here’s a breakdown of 2022’s most important chips, and what they’ll mean when you’re looking for a new laptop, computer, or phone this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WBK3tc"&gt;Laptops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MZOC9y"&gt;2022 is shaping up to be a very interesting year for new laptops, thanks to AMD and Intel — both of which announced full slates of new laptop chips at CES 2022, which will likely power almost any major computer released this year that doesn’t have an Apple logo on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="392Zcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lots of new laptop hardware&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wWZNLm"&gt;Intel’s updates appear to be the more notable of the two companies, with the announcement of its Alder Lake family of chips for its entire laptop range (although only the most powerful H-series chips made their formal debut; the U-series and P-series lineups for lighter-weight laptops are set to arrive later in 2022). Like last year’s Alder Lake desktop chips, the new laptop chips are the first to feature Intel’s new (some might say Arm-esque) architecture with a mix of performance and efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rZoUXLvvbEWktQCn47-4fD92mQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142901/12th_gen_mobile_chip_pose_06_4000px.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eSEIB2"&gt;The first wave of Alder Lake desktop processors were &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; impressive, a breakthrough product for an Intel that had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;been caught in a yearslong slump of delays&lt;/a&gt; for its 10nm process (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594074/intel-acclerated-new-architecture-roadmap-naming-7nm-2025"&gt;since renamed Intel 7&lt;/a&gt;). If Intel can realize similar success on its laptop lineup, Alder Lake could be the edge the company needs to fend off an ascendant AMD and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8CJwX"&gt;Processors are only a piece of the puzzle, though, and Intel’s biggest product of 2022 was still largely missing from CES 2022: its upcoming lineup of discrete Arc GPUs, which will be rolling out later this year for desktop &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;laptop devices. The company has already started teasing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865560/intel-arc-gpu-teaser-alchemist-ces-2022-oem"&gt;major partners like Dell, HP, and Samsung&lt;/a&gt; will be using its chips (in addition to adding the requirement that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856046/intel-evo-laptop-standard-foldable-laptops-h-series-project-athena-ces-2022"&gt;Intel Evo-branded laptops&lt;/a&gt; with discrete GPUs will need to be using Arc chips to get Intel’s seal of approval). And Intel is making big promises about the potential of combining its integrated graphics in conjunction with discrete Arc GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/adaptix/deep-link.html"&gt;through its Deep Link technology&lt;/a&gt; for bigger gains. But for now, Arc is still one of the biggest question marks for 2022’s computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaRkIf"&gt;On the other side of the aisle are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD’s new Ryzen 6000 chips&lt;/a&gt; for its laptops. This year’s chips still are using a slightly upgraded architecture from last year’s Ryzen 5000 (AMD calls its Zen 3 Plus and called out a few improvements like bumps to performance and battery life). That’s fine, given that last year’s Ryzen chips were already great —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt; AMD’s 2021 laptops were its first truly premium designs in ages&lt;/a&gt;, with great battery life, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22548663/razer-blade-14-review-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-5900hx-nvidia-rtx-3070"&gt;excellent performance&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;powerful discrete GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RG-699T4XpCmshx07FoajVAvCDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160565/Screen_Shot_2022_01_11_at_9.03.17_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LIzmAa"&gt;The integrated GPU side of things, though, is where this year’s biggest changes are for AMD, which is finally upgrading to its new RDNA 2 architecture here instead of continuing to use its old Vega GPU designs. RDNA 2 is the same architecture that the PS5 and Xbox Series X have, and while the integrated GPUs on 2022 AMD laptops won’t &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; approach the power of those consoles, they’re even closer (with the top Radeon RX 6850M XT GPU actually offering more compute units than the PS5 does). All told, AMD is promising some big boosts for gaming on laptops, which is an exciting prospect… if the chips actually hold up to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DDKUDN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;AMD has some big gaming updates&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtJYV"&gt;And for those who need more power, AMD also has a slate of new notebook GPUs, expanding its lower-end range for its 6000M series chips. It’s also introducing a new, more power-efficient line of Radeon 6000S chips for thinner and lighter laptops that — in theory — won’t have to compromise on gaming performance. Both of those lineups will be based on RDNA 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Nr1FZ"&gt;Lastly, there’s Nvidia, which announced a refreshed wave of powerful laptop GPUs that are coming soon: mobile versions of the RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti, which promise 1440p gaming at 100 and 120 frames per second and can integrate with a laptop’s CPU to balance power and temperature for maximum performance. Nvidia tells us they’re roughly 10-20 percent more powerful than their non-Ti laptop predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qmhmdp6umSn-6Sp_vSd5gNaW7vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144576/chrome_MtQmNzsoUF.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vpKkNV"&gt;All said, it’s an exciting time to be looking to buy a new laptop in the coming weeks or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLbYKa"&gt;Of course, all that goes without acknowledging the elephant in the room: Apple, which has not so quietly been establishing itself as a silicon force to be reckoned with thanks to its excellent M1 series of processors. (They recently received high-powered upgrades in the company’s late 2021 MacBook Pros — resulting in some of the best performance and battery life on any computer &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has ever tested.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mmTDnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Qualcomm will probably have to wait until next year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTNRI3"&gt;Qualcomm is also trying again to make inroads with laptops, a market that the company (which thoroughly dominates mobile SoCs) has yet to really break into in any meaningful way. This year, the company has its new Snapdragon 8cx Gen 3 chipset, which the company says offers an 85 percent jump in CPU performance and a 60 percent faster GPU compared to Qualcomm’s previous laptop chip. That said, the new platform is off to a slow start: CES 2022 came and went without a single device announced using the 8cx Gen 3, and Qualcomm itself seems to be pinning its future not on its current flagship laptop chip, but a 2023 chip designed by the Nuvia team that will “set the performance benchmark for Windows PCs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBXVa"&gt;While Apple didn’t make an appearance at CES 2022, the shadow of its chips were definitely felt: Intel defiantly rolled out slides of benchmarks claiming its new Alder Lake H-series chips were even more powerful than Cupertino’s best — something that we’ll have to test for ourselves when 2022’s new crop of laptops roll around. Battery life on Intel’s chips is also a big question mark, one that the company didn’t really address in its announcements. Nvidia also took a shot at Apple, arguing that its new RTX Studio-branded computers with its new GPUs can offer seven times the GPU performance as Apple’s M1 Max. But Apple itself is rumored to have its second-generation processors out later this year, which could throw 2022’s chip crown into contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bB4Rcr"&gt;Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UHmEEY"&gt;The desktop side of things was a little calmer at CES 2022. Intel caught up the rest of its desktop lineup to Alder Lake, as well (last year’s launch was just a trio of high-powered gaming chips). The new lineup should bring Intel’s new architecture strategy (which has two types of processor cores) to the rest of its desktops, including more consumer-friendly desktop towers and all-in-one PCs. The company also rolled out new, cheaper motherboard designs to go with the broader release of chips (which were badly needed, given that until now there was just a single high-end chipset available). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE3ADt"&gt;AMD (which hasn’t updated its desktop lineup since late 2020) only announced a single new chip coming in the first half of the year: Ryzen 7 5800X3D, which uses AMD’s 3D V-Cache stacking technology to squeak out an extra 15 percent of power compared to the Ryzen 5900X. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1hqEZvMf4RISZQ6DQob6ZI5lwBU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144140/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_8.02.34_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvFlJm"&gt;More exciting things are on the horizon for later in 2022, though, even if there’s going to be a bit of a wait to get them. AMD has started its next big processor refresh with the Ryzen 7000 line of chips, which will be powered by the company’s new Zen 4 architecture, jump to a 5nm process node, and add a new socket. The chips will switch to AMD’s new AM5 design, which puts pins on the motherboard instead of the CPUs. That means that for the first time in over five years, you’ll have to get a new motherboard to take advantage of AMD’s new CPUs. Those chips won’t arrive until the second half of the year, but they should make a pretty big splash when they do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJoeCr"&gt;Nvidia also showed off its upcoming RTX 3090 Ti, which will take the crown as the company’s most powerful consumer graphics card when it arrives later this year (with a presumably sky-high price tag to match its performance).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d1NA3pSU803m-Z4iGtlydXb4VJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144510/rtx3090Ti.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMlJhI"&gt;Similar to the laptop side of things, 2022’s most mysterious chip product is Intel’s upcoming Arc discrete GPUs. Codenamed “Alchemist,” Intel will finally look to take on AMD and Nvidia directly for the minds, hearts, and GPU slots of gamers and creatives alike when it launches its extremely hyped consumer graphics cards later in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkYSih"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Arc is inbound&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okM4gJ"&gt;Intel has already showed off some interesting demos, like its XeSS super-sampling for 4K scaling (similar to Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FidelityFX Super Resolution). But the real test will come when the first GPUs actually ship. The current crop of rumors expect that Intel will be targeting the middle of the road for its first generation of GPUs (one leak from last fall &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/intel-arc-alchemist-gpu-could-be-a-game-changer-heres-everything-we-know"&gt;expects Intel’s best first-gen card&lt;/a&gt; to be competitive with about an RTX 3070), but we’ll have to wait for later this year when customers can see for themselves just how well Intel’s first major discrete GPUs in history really hold up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnEdiD"&gt;Lastly, there’s Apple, which is rumored to be expanding its Arm-based chips to the rest of its desktop lineup in 2022, where some of its most intriguing products have yet to be updated, like its high-powered Mac Pro desktop. It’ll be interesting to see how Apple manages to scale up its chip designs to that level of power and performance — especially with the fierce competition from AMD and Intel’s refreshed lineups mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyMcHD"&gt;Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jZrpY7"&gt;Things are a little simpler when it comes to mobile chips. If you’re buying an Android phone in the US, odds are it’ll have a Qualcomm chip powering it. If it’s a flagship device, it’ll be the recently announced Qualcomm 8 Gen 1, the company’s latest and greatest SoC that’s expected to start showing up in products like Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cx9ECELaIfVlFXwfXgJGcLFNL0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053632/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="26x4vd"&gt;Apple will use whatever it names the next iteration of its A-series chips for the iPhone (the same money is on the A16), but it’ll be exclusively in Apple products. Samsung has its new Exynos 2200 processor, which will mix things up a bit with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU, but odds are it won’t ever make it to the US for a variety of licensing and modem issues (along with the simple fact that Qualcomm’s chips historically perform better than Samsung’s).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpXs3W"&gt;Google is a company to watch, with its new Tensor SoC platform that it debuted on the Pixel 6 lineup last year; presumably, Google will be looking to follow that up with a second-generation version to power its 2022 smartphones. The company is rumored to be working on more powerful in-house chips for future Chromebooks, too — which could be extremely interesting in a world where Apple’s similarly custom-designed Arm-based laptops are some of the best computers around. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Monster Hunter Rise is better on PC, but something’s missing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H25x2umws8XYOgrTumrLs_evJXo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374104/MHRISE_PC___Magnamalo_03_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hN0Lq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; was one of the best games of 2021, taking almost all of the improvements Capcom made to its famously punishing action RPG series with &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt; and bringing them to an even breezier package on the Nintendo Switch. The series only took off in popularity with its portable entries on the PSP, so this new title tailored just for the Switch felt right at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijXjwo"&gt;That said, if you were used to &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; was a noticeable technical step back. It’s one of the best-looking games on the Switch, but it’s still a game on the Switch — it runs on a TV at roughly 720p and 30 frames a second, and the environmental design is much simpler than in &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJ0yRS"&gt;That’s why I was interested to check out the PC version of the game, which is releasing this week. How would &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; play when liberated from the Switch’s limited hardware? The news is mostly good on that front, but in another way the port represents a missed opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsM26MrKZ2ZISS4ouIKKS5u6GFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23160523/MHRISE_PC___Filters_Screen_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lYMwuT"&gt;Capcom’s PC ports tend to be pretty good, in my experience — though I didn’t play last year’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; on PC, which I know quite a few people had issues with — and &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; is another solid example. There’s a fairly detailed list of advanced graphical settings to tweak, and the game works great on an ultrawide monitor, though cutscenes are still 16:9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EnMp0"&gt;I didn’t find myself diving into the menus too much, because &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; runs on its highest settings at 60fps and beyond at 3440 x 1440 ultrawide resolution with my GTX 1080. Sure, it’s a Switch game, but my PC is nearly six years old, so I’m used to putting in work to optimize performance. While some PC ports — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839361/final-fantasy-7-remake-pc-review-epic-game-store"&gt;looking at you, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — require much more powerful hardware than their original consoles to run well (and even then might have issues), I think &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; should be fine on most fairly modern computers. There’s also a free demo on Steam if you’re unsure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8jAVm"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a much less visually impressive game than &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt;. It still looks good at higher resolutions, and the PC version has improved assets like much sharper textures, but the complexity of the environments and foliage density in particular takes a big hit. That’s partly just how the levels are designed, so it’s not surprising that Capcom hasn’t overhauled &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; entirely, but set your expectations accordingly. &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; looks stylish more than stunning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7HmCL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Steam cross-save is a game-changer for the Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143520/nintendo-switch-steam-cross-save-witcher-3"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8QGAsV"&gt;What’s disappointing about &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; on PC, though, is that I’ve already played a lot of it on the Switch. After the original &lt;em&gt;World&lt;/em&gt; and its &lt;em&gt;Iceborne&lt;/em&gt; expansion, this marks the third big &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; game in a row that’s come to PC several months after its console release. These are huge games that can be played for hundreds of hours, and the prospect of starting all over again and slogging through the easy early quests isn’t going to be appealing for most experienced players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8IcnRp"&gt;This wouldn’t be as much of a problem if Capcom allowed for save transfer between PC and Switch, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143520/nintendo-switch-steam-cross-save-witcher-3"&gt;seen&lt;/a&gt; in other big games like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Civilization VI&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Divinity: Original Sin 2&lt;/em&gt;, but the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1447630591302713345"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s “unable” to implement the feature. While there may well be technical challenges involved, it’s particularly regrettable because Capcom was ahead of the curve in this regard when handling transfers between the Wii U and 3DS versions of &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter 3&lt;/em&gt;. Capcom evidently understands that it’s great to make progress on the go and continue on better hardware when you’re at home — you can dock your Switch to a TV, of course, but it’s not the same experience as this PC version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UdkS3s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is a great game that’s even better on PC, but it’s hard to recommend if you’ve already played it on the Switch and don’t have unlimited free time. If you managed to get a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt; preorder, though, this could well be the perfect game to christen it with for anyone looking to get into the series. It’s just unfortunate that &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; enthusiasts who already jumped on &lt;em&gt;Rise&lt;/em&gt; will have to start from scratch. I hope Capcom releases future &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter&lt;/em&gt; games on PC at the same time as consoles, or finds a way to include cross-save functionality — ideally both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ESrpJj"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Monster Hunter Rise &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the PC on January 12th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Corsair gaming keyboards are cheaper than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wb46ceNX1uW7uf4rnffZq-Q_kdU=/1x0:2400x1599/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374082/6453148cv27d.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IGds5H"&gt;We found three discounted gaming keyboards from Corsair that should please most people, coming in a variety of form factors and with different features. First up is Corsair’s first 60 percent keyboard, the K65. This compact keyboard is normally $109.99 but has recently dropped to $89.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgohljzOVZz" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Customizable-Backlighting-Keyswitches-Hyper-Processing/dp/B08W2CSXLM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. We last saw the K65 drop to this price during Black Friday. While the diminutive layout of this keyboard certainly isn’t for everyone, it should appeal to those who are striving for a minimalist aesthetic on their desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZCQVV"&gt;Just like other 60 percent keyboards, the K65 eliminates the function row, directional arrows, and navigation keys that let you easily go up and down the page. This keyboard uses Cherry MX Silver switches and uses a detachable USB-C connector. The PBT keycaps even use a standard layout, allowing you to swap in custom keycap sets if you want.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ob5nj0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOV7bi"&gt;The most conventional keyboard we’re including today is the Corsair K70 RGB 2 Rapidfire. This model typically retails for $169.99, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgohFMQJviC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CORSAIR-MK-2-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B07D5S54C5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have discounted this full-size keyboard to $109.99. While this isn’t the lowest price we’ve seen for this particular model, it’s a good value for anyone in the market for a keyboard that doesn’t skimp on any features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm59Su"&gt;The K70 RGB 2 Rapidfire features dedicated media playback buttons, USB passthrough, and is equipped with Cherry MX Silver switches. While the keycaps are ABS plastic, which aren’t as durable as PBT caps, the K70’s standard layout means you can easily swap them out with some custom PBT keycaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uxz8Ne"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970731"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aTNR5r"&gt;The final Corsair model being discounted is something of an oddity. The K60 RGB Low Profile is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Profile-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard/dp/B08J6FC3F3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $79.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, a solid discount on its typical $109.99 price tag. This gaming keyboard maintains a full-size footprint with a number pad and function row, but it employs a shorter version of the Cherry MX Speed switch paired with slimmer keycaps. The end result is a keyboard with low-profile keys, which for some may offer a slightly more comfortable typing experience. While the slimmer chassis still supports USB passthrough, the keycaps are, again, ABS plastic, not PBT, and will likely slowly accumulate visible grease and fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L335XL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970772"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uv2W7V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The ROG Strix Flare II Animate puts a tiny dot-matrix display on a keyboard  ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867722/asus-strix-flare-ii-animate-keyboard-mini-led-dot-matrix-display-swapable-key-switches"},{"title":"How and why I built my first mechanical keyboard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18683728/mechanical-keyboard-diy-building-guide-how-to-75-percent-pcb-case-zealio-keyswitches-zealpc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1IhucM"&gt;One of the most feature-packed mice from Razer, the Basilisk Ultimate is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Ultimate-HyperSpeed-Wireless/dp/B07YPBX9Y7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $113.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgog6uQT2q0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This wireless mouse features eight programmable buttons, a 25K DPI sensor, and is capable of lasting for up to 100 hours on a single charge. The Basilisk Ultimate also comes equipped with a detachable DPI switch that allows you to quickly swap between DPI settings and adjustable tension for its scroll wheel. Some call it a sniper button, as it can let you more easily line up a shot with a lower DPI. The mouse is definitely a bit on the heavy side, weighing in at 103 grams, but if larger mice don’t bother you, the Basilisk Ultimate is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X0Y6dW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10970679"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KNOdiD"&gt;Westinghouse may not be the first name you associate with gaming monitors, but this 32-inch panel presents an amazing value. Typically $299.99, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fp%2FN82E16824569005" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg has discounted this monitor to just $229.99&lt;/a&gt;. Boasting a 1440p resolution and 144Hz refresh rate, this model shares features with other gaming monitors that are nearly double the price. The Westinghouse Gaming Monitor also features AMD FreeSync to help cut down on screen tearing with AMD graphics cards, and in terms of ports, you’re getting a pair of HDMI connections, a single Display Port input, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The monitor is compatible with VESA mounts, and the included stand is both height and tilt adjustable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g3MEFa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10971699"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h1lxhf"&gt;If you’re in the market for a decent webcam, or just a webcam equipped with its own dedicated lighting, the Razer Kiyo is currently discounted to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Kiyo-Streaming-Webcam-Built/dp/B075N1BYWB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60.99, its lowest price ever at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The specs are fairly standard for a standalone sub-$100 webcam, capable of capturing 30fps at 1080p or 60fps at 720p. However, the standout feature of this webcam is the built-in ring light, which can be very helpful in low-light situations or anywhere that suffers from uneven lighting. Just like virtually all of Razer’s peripherals, the Kiyo is compatible with its Synapse software which also allows you to fine-tune things like depth of field and lighting temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="44oFSD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10602056"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU6JrU"&gt;More gaming deals you may find tempting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ki1zwY"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrowse%2Fnintendo-digital-deals%2F0%2F0%3F_refineresult%3Dtrue%26_be_shelf_id%3D70349%26search_sort%3D100%26facet%3Dshelf_id%253A70349&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals01112022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart is discounting several digital Nintendo Switch titles&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;em&gt;Tetris Effect: Connected&lt;/em&gt; ($26.79, down from $39.99), &lt;em&gt;Mario Tennis Aces&lt;/em&gt; ($41.99, down from $59.99), &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/em&gt; ($41.99, down from $59.99), &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze&lt;/em&gt; ($41.99, down from $59.99), and more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5kqkCH"&gt;That ISP-provided modem (that you may be paying each month to loan) might be holding back the download and upload speeds that you pay for. Arris’ Surfboard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 modem boasts support for Xfinity, Cox, and Spectrum internet (Arris says it’s compatible with most US cable providers), and it might be a great fit for your needs. It offers up to 683Mbps download and 131Mbps upload. Normally $80, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARRIS-SURFboard-SB6183-Docsis-Packaging/dp/B00MA5U1FW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it costs $54.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yeE3Ha"&gt;We highlighted this great deal last week, but &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; for Nintendo Switch is still &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XV4NHHN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$54.99 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (normally $79.99).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Nvidia announces new RTX 3080 with 12GB of memory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gaTcf-OIPeSuxljaheXPB-VBogw=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70374076/twarren_rtx3080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ESTLWN"&gt;Nvidia is launching a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fgraphics-cards%2F30-series%2Frtx-3080-3080ti%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878021%2Fnvidia-rtx-3080-12gb-model-release-date-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new 12GB model&lt;/a&gt; of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidia’s latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NioVbA"&gt;A memory bump is welcome, particularly as it was a source of concern during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;initial review of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. It also matches the 12GB found on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;RTX 3080 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. This new RTX 3080 model also includes 8960 CUDA cores, a bump of nearly 3 percent over the original. The upgraded memory also means this GPU has 20 percent more cumulative bandwidth over the original 10GB variant, thanks to a wider 384-bit memory bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qgtTu"&gt;Nvidia is still recommending a 750W power supply, but this 12GB RTX 3080 draws an extra 30 watts of power, up to 350 watts in total compared to the 320W draw on the original RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1AKxj"&gt;It’s a relatively minor upgrade over the original RTX 3080, and it’s guaranteed to be as difficult to purchase in stores. Nvidia’s new 12GB RTX 3080 arrives just days after the company also announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866454/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-specifications-release-date-price-ces-2022"&gt;new RTX 3090 Ti&lt;/a&gt; with faster memory and better performance, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864989/nvidia-rtx-3050-gpu-ray-tracing-dlss-price-release-date-ces-2022"&gt;$249 RTX 3050&lt;/a&gt;. The budget RTX 3050 offers ray tracing and DLSS support at a much more affordable price, assuming you’re about to snag one at retail price. Nvidia is promising to detail more about the RTX 3090 Ti later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9T6Yx"&gt;RTX 3080 12GB pricing will be determined largely by board partners, so we’re waiting to hear more announcements from vendors to determine exactly how this new GPU will be priced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXjmjU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, January 11th 9:15AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated to note full pricing details for the new RTX 3080 aren’t available yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker is an emotional culmination of a decade-long journey</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H06KEjhgIckA5peHQnE1ciWcxaY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70373989/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32__1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thou must live, die, and know&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="hWThCZ"&gt;The easiest way to describe &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is to call it a game about hope. That’s not really a unique descriptor since, to some degree, all &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games, MMORPG or otherwise, are about hope. (Not&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy VIII, &lt;/em&gt;though — that game is about child soldiers and hot dogs.) However, despite &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s unflagging commitment to “the power of friendship,” it’s the game’s unvarnished look at the other side of hope — oppressive and omnipresent despair — and the real strength it takes to maintain that hope in the face of such despair that makes it the best &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; experiences I’ve had in 30-plus years of the series’ existence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXiBiJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major Endwalker Spoilers throughout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4vx-ff7set65XWpkWjTVv6IkfU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159274/FFXIV_1106PLL_Mediakit_Launch_Trailer_06.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eyXo9K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children in whom Life flows abundant&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To all of my children to whom Death hath passed his judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soul yearns for honor, and the flesh the hereafter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look to those who walked before to lead those who walk after&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyETOq"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, the latest expansion of the Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG, your character and their rag-tag group of mercenaries for hire masquerading as a benevolent, non-governmental organization are tasked with averting the second occurrence of The Final Days, an apocalyptic event that sundered the world and all its people a millennium or so previous. Through the events of the previous expansion, you learn that the malevolent force Zodiark is key to unlocking the mystery of why the Final Days have returned, necessitating a trip to his prison on the moon. Because this is a JRPG and a &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; game, besides, the plot isn’t as straightforward as that. Though this quick and dirty plot summary and &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s trailer would have you believe Zodiark and the moon are your end goals, you conclude that plot in the first quarter of the expansion. What follows is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orPHei"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shining is the Land’s light of justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ever flows the Land’s well of purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z391l3"&gt;I play video games because I love stories, and video games promise me, more than books or movies, the opportunity to live in a story. I derive pleasure from suspending disbelief, imagining the characters I interact with as alive, their words and deeds organic and authentic, not a series of 1s and 0s strung together by someone else. Games are immersive and interactive, but there will always be an impenetrable veil between my real life and the fabrication of life a game presents. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;is a game that gets the closest to piercing that veil. It’s in the way the developers wrote the characters, the way the game lets me respond to those characters, and even the way the game makes my character emote in cutscenes. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, more than any of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s expansions, feels so alive I barely noticed the extremely late sleep-deprived nights I spent working my way through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrUMcL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walk free, walk free, walk free, believe...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Land is alive, so believe&lt;/em&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hnk42P"&gt;The technical and financial limitations of video game development mean that the way stories are written and how characters act rarely reflect how real people behave and how real emotions are felt. In a video game, the death of a major character might evoke a singular moment of sadness wherein the game acknowledges a beloved friend died, before returning to normal, the death barely or never again recalled. By contrast, dealing with real grief isn’t a linear process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTTLLf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;acknowledges grieving’s messy, winding road. In conversations with your companions, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; will suddenly flash back to a snowy grave and a broken shield, reminding you of Haurchefant Greystone, a friend who died protecting you way back in &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt;. The game remembers the sadness you felt in that moment and brings it back for you to feel again multiple times though it’s been several years and two expansions since, the same way real grief can suddenly reappear unbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FDa-uMSuplBnE3B0v3jMEFpzVtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159323/2021_04_18_14_31_54_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Final Fantasy has never once let you forget Haurchefant’s sacrifice, and for that, I’ll love this game forever.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JYiCI5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suffer (Feel) Promise (Think) Witness (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Wander (Think) Stumble (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Speak) Honor (Speak) Value (Tell) Whisper (Tell) Mention&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgoBhm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker &lt;/em&gt;also exhibits what authentic growth as a person looks like. At the end of &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;, your enemy, before he perishes, asks that you remember him and his extinct peoples. This adversary, Emet-Selch, fought against you because the only way for him to bring back his people is the destruction of your world. (Long story, but it makes sense in context.) Later in &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a conversation in which you can respond, “Remember,” as though Emet-Selch’s words were something you took to heart. In other conversations, you can respond with quotes you’ve heard from friends lost expansions ago — “a smile better suits a hero,” or “for those we have lost, and for those we can yet save” — making it feel like the events of previous expansions weren’t just cutscenes you watched but lessons you learned from and acted upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxk1am"&gt;This kind of grief and growth isn’t limited to the player character but your companions as well. One character, Alphinaud, makes a pretty terrible mistake back in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;. Most games would have him apologize and move on, never referencing that mistake again. But for Alphinaud, in every expansion after his transgression, he brings up how he’s still trying to learn from it, demonstrating that remorse and repentance aren’t states of being but active processes that must be worked on continuously. I hated Alphinaud for his mistake. Of my companions, I liked him the least. All throughout &lt;em&gt;Heavensward&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stormblood&lt;/em&gt;, I bore a grudge against him, a grudge that softened each time he recalled that mistake, owned it, and did things that showed he was working on never making that mistake again. By&lt;em&gt; Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, he was as dear to me as Haurchefant, something that only happened because the game didn’t force his redemption in a quick turnaround but showed it gradually and authentically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5MKSqC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Endwalker is a 60-plus-hour &lt;em&gt;feast&lt;/em&gt; of emotions that wrap up the last 10 years and four expansions’ worth of story in the most perfect of bows&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2PDFj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hope) Ponder (Hope) Warrant (Wish) Cherish (Wish) Welcome&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Roam) Witness (Roam) Listen (Roam) Suffer (Roam) Sanction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Sleep) Weather (Sleep) Wander (Sleep) Answer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsW2sp"&gt;In MMOs and other games in which you can create and personalize the main character, you’re often a blank slate. The bits of your personality you can give your avatar don’t extend beyond its physical appearance. Even in games that let you choose dialogue, you only get close to what you might actually say. In the rare moments &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; let you speak, the dialogue often reflected my exact feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDa7hY"&gt;In the game’s final zone, your comrades sacrifice themselves one by one in order for you to reach the final antagonist. Your last remaining companions are Alphinaud and his twin sister Alisaie — who had an easier time than her brother getting into my heart because I love her “punch the problem until it’s no longer a problem” attitude. They know, and you know that they’ll have to sacrifice themselves in order for you to continue. When Alphinaud tried to bring this up, I shouted at my screen, “Shut up! I don’t want to hear this,” because I couldn’t process losing characters I thought of as my children, especially after already losing all of my other companions. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers knew what I and many others were likely feeling at this moment, offering me the perfect dialogue response: “Not. Another. Word.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NDc0iW9xI4Vmbt0xwbYVMpXpFwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159320/2022_01_04_14_50_41_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;I get by with a little help from my friends.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUwcSw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now open your eyes while our plight is repeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still deaf to our cries, lost in hope we lie defeated&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eaS3WH"&gt;In addition to giving me the perfect dialogue choices, I’m impressed by &lt;em&gt;Endwalker’&lt;/em&gt;s ability to intuit exactly what I want as a player. &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;’s writers know the game’s strength lies in its characters. So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ue058b"&gt;In the latter half, the player is sent into the past in hopes of learning what happened during the first Final Days. There, I was reintroduced to characters I met and had grown attached to in &lt;em&gt;Shadowbringers&lt;/em&gt;. My first thought was, “Oh, &lt;em&gt;please&lt;/em&gt; let me run a dungeon with them,” thinking there was no way that would happen. (In &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;, you can run dungeons with other players or create a party out of your NPC companions.) Even though these characters occupy a significant place in &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s lore, they would only be around for this one area. I believed there was no way the developers would invest in making them combat-capable for what could only be a one-off thing. One of my first true shocks and moments of pure delight was when the game let me run a dungeon with Emet-Selch, Hythlodaeus, and Venat watching my back. It’s one of the coolest story moments in the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCPiTf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our souls have been torn, and our bodies forsaken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bearing sins of the past, for our future is taken&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfpp1r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t really innovate in its gameplay, but its story is so good that it doesn’t have to. My two main jobs are gunbreaker and astrologian — a tank and healer class, respectively. Tweaks to the leveling system meant that the main story quest line didn’t reward enough EXP for me to level my two classes. A lot of times, there wasn’t enough main story quest EXP to take a single job from one level to the next, requiring me to create an elaborate and efficient EXP extraction plan so I could level my two jobs evenly with minimal grinding, which I utterly hate. Frustrating as all that math was, I enjoyed the intricate dance of dungeon running and side-questing; it kept the calmer, less exciting parts of the story interesting. There’s nothing quite like the thrill of running full tilt at a fate — quests available only at a certain place for a certain amount of time — hoping to get there before other players complete it and its sweet, sweet double EXP award is lost to you forever. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zzcPMFDddvcyRsOGSlWX8KCTPmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159372/2022_01_05_21_00_29_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Endwalker is so well constructed that this character is not merely an avatar of me, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; me. (And she’s so pretty!)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tqxZur"&gt;&lt;em&gt;War born of strife, these trials persuade us not&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Words without sound, these lies betray our thoughts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mired by a plague of doubt, the Land, she mourns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Judgment binds all we hold to a memory of scorn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z3AyVk"&gt;There is no way anyone at Square Enix could have known &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would launch in the middle of a global pandemic, when its message of radical, defiant hope would hit the strongest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIsiWs"&gt;Its main antagonist, Meteion, is a being made to intuit others’ emotions and tasked with understanding life. To that end, she was sent to find sentient beings on other planets to ask them their meaning of life. Meteion found planets destroyed by war or natural catastrophe or populated by beings who so lamented their achievement of immortality that only death could give comfort. Finding nothing but death, and so subsumed by the infinity of suffering she found, she concluded that life is meaningless and death preferable, so she sets in motion the end of all life everywhere.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8GVjr"&gt;Omicron rages in the United States, where we recently broke the global record for number of infections in a single day. Even as vaccines become more available, every day, people die by the thousands, forced to say goodbye to loved ones through the cold, impersonal screens of cellphones and tablets. Every day, I live and labor in a country in which its hate for my people and other marginalized identities are baked into its every institution. I struggle under the oppressive weight of a government that would risk its citizens’ health and safety in order to keep an economy running. Every day, my social media feeds are choked with tales of pain and sadness, preventable and not. Now, more than ever, it seems like life is a pointless struggle, and I can barely find the strength to keep going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRXlBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tell us why, given Life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGt4MJ"&gt;Video games like to answer this dilemma of hopelessness with a protagonist or companions who have either boundless optimism or boundless strength. Whatever they have, it’s always enough to overcome the problem. It’s the same kind of toxic positivity of social media influencers. “Everything will be OK so long as you believe.” It’s a philosophy that takes the act of faith for granted without confronting the reality of how hard it is to believe in the face of the relentless suffering life throws at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KlxAvz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So often, character-driven games like &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will shunt you from quest to quest, giving you very little time to do what you really came for — to just hang out with your pals. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UeCBaR"&gt;Throughout your journey in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV,&lt;/em&gt; your character endured prolific suffering and loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMMwZP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t blindly ask of you your faith. Rather, it uses the trials of your character’s life as proof you already have the strength required to continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xni20y"&gt;In a world beset by relentless bleakness, I need that message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJhoJv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Witness (Feel) Suffer (Think) Borrow (Teach) Reason&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Follow (Feel) Stumble (Think) Wander (Teach) Listen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxo5xg"&gt;I am the kind of person for which aural memories last longer and evoke more emotion in me than memories of sight or touch. When I first saw the trailer for &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; back in 2013, even though I hadn’t played the original doomed &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV &lt;/em&gt;before its reboot and wouldn’t play until years later in 2021, I cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="etom6B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h542YbZuwkQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H5j7gj"&gt;In the trailer, there’s a fierce battle in which it looks like the good guys are losing badly. I didn’t know who any of the characters were, nor did I care about them, but I still cried as a woman sang, lamenting their pain and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HahuvI"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, one of the first songs you hear isn’t the song “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/zTTtd6bnhFs"&gt;Footfalls&lt;/a&gt;” from the trailer — it’s this song “Answers” from nine years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mom1Lk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; game director Naoki Yoshida said that &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; would be the conclusion of the story begun in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; — the story begun by this trailer. I was skeptical that a single expansion could deliver on that promise, believing it would still be an enjoyable experience but fail to live up to such vaunted expectations. But when &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; first played “Answers,” I understood that whatever happened, it would make good on Yoshida’s declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pDPoG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; songfic — a common fanfiction format in which a story is based around a song. The story evokes the song’s themes and sometimes the song’s lyrics are woven into the text of the story itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIi6pW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Blink) Whisper (Blink) Shoulder (Blink) Ponder (Blink) Weather&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hear) Answer (Look) Answer (Think) Answer together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQpHok"&gt;The true beauty of &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is realizing that for a decade, we’ve been working backward. Yoshida meant for &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; to tie up everything that began in &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt; and achieves that by having &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; ask the question &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn &lt;/em&gt;answered 10 years ago: what is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1czZk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thy Life is a riddle, to bear rapture and sorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To listen, to suffer, to entrust unto tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkhuvM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; does not mince its words. It nakedly acknowledges in a way games seldom do that life really does seem pointless in the face of omnipresent death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qR5ZhPbdoMW-oUfRT3fXbCmXeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23159306/2022_01_10_16_14_06_Greenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yes, G’raha Tia, you can haz cheezburger&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GiHA9v"&gt;Early in the game, you’re given the opportunity to take a break from all the terror that accompanies the end of the world and have a party with your friends. The table was littered with some of the best-looking video game food I’ve seen, including a tasty cheeseburger the party’s resident catboy, G’raha Tia, tears into, in fulfillment of an internet question asked ages ago — &lt;a href="https://cheezburger.com/875511040/original-cat-meme-that-started-cheezburger"&gt;yes, you can has cheeseburger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dx2524"&gt;That’s it. That’s life. A struggle for survival punctuated by pockets of joy made sweeter because of the loved ones around you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0xTLq"&gt;I don’t need a video game to teach me a lesson, especially if the lesson is essentially “Life sucks, and then you die.” But it’s nice to have a game that acknowledges shit sucks without overselling its misery while also ending on a hopeful note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNLf4r"&gt;&lt;em&gt;In one fleeting moment, from the Land doth life flow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yet in one fleeting moment, for anew it doth grow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the same fleeting moment thou must live, die and know&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
