  &lt;p id="9j2h7t"&gt;Multiple Google services are currently experiencing outages, with some users unable to create new documents in Google Docs and Google Sheets. &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&amp;amp;v=status"&gt;Google’s Workspace Status Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is reporting that Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Classroom are all experiencing service disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H33m1k"&gt;When trying to create a new document in Google Docs, the following error message appears: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YfJXEm"&gt;Google Docs encountered an error.

&lt;p id="DO8VSZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;Downdetector is currently showing spikes&lt;/a&gt; in issues with Google Drive, Google Classroom, and Google itself, though we’ve not encountered any issues on Google’s main search site. The outage appears to be occurring in multiple countries, if &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=google%20docs%20down&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;reports on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, and we’ve verified problems are occurring in the UK and US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for its usual $50 price tag at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $60, its usual price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $50 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; but no discounts are available, instead it’s usual $60 price is available &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $75 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $81, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;Right now, Amazon’s Echo Show 10 is on sale for the first time ever. You can grab the latest generation Echo Show 10 for $200 ($50 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KCzr6b"&gt;If you missed out on Woot’s deal a few weeks ago that offered refurbished Kindle Oasis e-readers for $100, there’s another good deal happening today. The last-gen version of the Oasis is once again available, but it’s new with special offers (Amazon’s lock screen ads) and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/VergeLastGenKindle041221/https://www.woot.com/offers/amazon-oasis-e-reader-32gb-wifi-only-gold-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $170&lt;/a&gt;. For context, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07F7TLZF4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new Oasis costs $250&lt;/a&gt;. As for what’s different between the current model and this one, you’ll miss out on a screen that can adapt its color temperature to your environment. But you’ll still get a waterproof e-reader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/30/18644795/kindle-oasis-amazon-button-page-turn-book-e-reader"&gt;that feels more like a book&lt;/a&gt; to use than other models, says my colleague Chaim Gartenberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWa1Jd"&gt;This deal loops in the 32GB model in gold. The sale will end later today, if it doesn’t sell out first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iUMjyF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10419831"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YRWJ8E"&gt;Best Buy is offering big discounts &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737564647376876492#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on several Apple-made iPhone cases&lt;/a&gt;. Included in the bunch are cases for the iPhone 12 mini with MagSafe support, the iPhone 11 Pro series, the iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max, and more. The range includes leather cases, smart battery cases, and silicone cases.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N1C264"&gt;Several retailers have lowered the price of the new Echo Show 10 smart display to $200 (from $250), which is the best price yet. But &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08M1N8522?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only at Amazon can you check out&lt;/a&gt; with a free Ring smart bulb added to the order for no extra charge. There have been a few models of the Echo Show 10, but this one has a motorized base that lets the screen swivel around to remain visible as you move around the room. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;My colleague Dan Seifert recently posted a review about it&lt;/a&gt;, so check it out if you’re curious to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5nfW6L"&gt;A reputable seller on eBay is selling “not pink” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FGoogle-Pixel-3-with-64GB-Memory-Cell-Phone-Unlocked-Not-Pink-New-SEALED-%2F363296604619%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F4%2F12%2F22379599%2Famazon-kindle-oasis-ereader-iphone-case-echo-show-10-google-pixel-3-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Pixel 3s with 64GB of storage for just $170&lt;/a&gt;. Each phone is carrier unlocked and comes sealed in its original packaging. As a Pixel 3 owner, this price seems good to me for a new model. This phone’s battery life isn’t great, but its stock Android software, camera performance, and display quality are still fantastic a few years on. If you’re capped at $200 for a new phone that you can use on any carrier, it’s tough to beat this value. Though, you should know that Android 12 may be the last major software update that’s set to come to this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgwqrf"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/refurbished_pixel_3?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sells this model refurbished for $250 at its online store&lt;/a&gt;, just to illustrate how good this deal for a new phone is.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EMA4Er2sFrxHrUuDpHfpSH0b1VM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68898291/bfarsace_201130_4322_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WeXuhD"&gt;When it comes to truly wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, I encourage you to read out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;Best Wireless Earbuds buyer’s guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you determine which pair of earbuds is best for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EnOnUF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;APPLE AIRPODS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products in general, the AirPods Pro are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant has better sound quality and features noise cancellation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. You can also get a new pair for $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock May 8th). While &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has the earbuds available for $219 and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1513304-REG%2Fapple_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html%2FDFF%2Fd10-v21-t1-x995659%2FSID%2F66960X1514734X399deab46224a444932767312ff6c84b#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; has the AirPods Pro for $225.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of second-generation AirPods. The entry-level model includes a wired charging case. Usually retailing for $160, you can get them for $129 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;For a few dollars more, you can get a new pair of AirPods with a wireless charging case. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, they are $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;SAMSUNG GALAXY BUDS DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are no current deals available for the Galaxy Buds Pro, but you can buy a pair for the usual retail price of $190 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771584476830246" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733771635387220077" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1614521-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r190nzkaxar_galaxy_buds_pro_noise_canceling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus were our top pick last year as the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in different color options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9qe27"&gt;Right now, you can get a pair for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693938480222182" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$120 at Samsung’s direct website&lt;/a&gt; in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733693993307410932" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now — but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. These are a good option if you want earbuds that produce a powerful sound and include lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScDytt"&gt;The lowest price you can buy the Samsung GalaxyBuds Live is $100 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735168432735464332#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt; But, if you want new pair of these bean-shaped earbuds you can get them for $150 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733697059048914646#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736564903391373246#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u5smDl"&gt;OTHER TRUE WIRELESS EARBUD DEALS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t. Although no deals are available now, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for their normal price of $230 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If a $230 price tag is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. The Jabra 75t are our pick for the best true wireless earbuds that are ideal for the multitasker in your life. They’re a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9znxnQ"&gt;You can buy a pair in titanium black for its usual price of $130 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X9VG6ZJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733698116592948428" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;If you are in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the Beats Powerbeats Pro. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about sweat ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at Best Buy for $160 in either &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773029374008951" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733773015236913845" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;yellow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Odu94n"&gt;Amazon has select colors (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07WBTX9FH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy blue&lt;/a&gt;) on sale for $170.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ve6XpF"&gt;Online game subscriptions are quite common in the gaming industry. Whether it's a subscription for an online service for multiplayer gaming or Netflix-like services that provide access to a massive library of games to play, gaming subscriptions provide good incentives and a lot of value for many gamers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wAgFMs"&gt;While sales tend to stay steady throughout the year, these subscription services will hold promotions or discounts now and then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="75ZAPD"&gt;PlayStation subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2CYtx"&gt;PlayStation Plus is arguably the most popular subscription service available on PlayStation consoles. Subscribing comes with a few perks outside of occasional discounts on the PlayStation Store and playing (most) games online. Each month, Sony provides a rotation of games you can play for free so long as you have an active subscription. If you own a PS5, you have access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PS Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital library of “generation-defining games” originally released for the PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouXbHO"&gt;A one-year subscription to PlayStation Plus normally retails for $60, but &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fstore%2Fpsn-subscriptions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba&lt;/a&gt; tends to sell digital keys for US subscribers for less than half of its usual price. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US players can grab a year for $27&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it is $60 at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK5QG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465838929287529#donlotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-plus-1-year-membership%2F10084626.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. The service is also available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B017V6YVDC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Plus-Month-Membership-Digital/dp/B004RMK57U?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 for three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQl0wf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eA7sP"&gt;PlayStation Now is Sony’s cloud gaming service, allowing subscribers to stream games released on the PS2, PS3, and PS4 on their PS4, PS5, and PCs. The service tends to release new games into the library regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6jNP0"&gt;New users can do a seven-day free trial to get a feel for the service. Otherwise, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B00ZGG1HZA?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monthly subscription&lt;/a&gt; costs $10, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736465889242682683" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of the service&lt;/a&gt; in advance costs $25, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a year-long subscription&lt;/a&gt; is $60. &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-now-12-month-subscription-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba has a one-year subscription available for $27&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest we have seen it go for, although Sony recently had a promotion where new subscribers could get one month free of charge. Alternatively, it is $60 at typical retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Now-Month-Subscription-Digital/dp/B019CYYSFC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-now-1-year-subscription%2F11097720.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6LMQ2H"&gt;Xbox subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuSn3s"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is Microsoft’s flagship gaming subscription right now. Subscribing to this service nets you access to Game Pass Console and Game Pass PC. It bundles Xbox Live Gold, a premium online service. Additionally, Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, is included with Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkcdOo"&gt;You can choose between &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a monthly plan for $15&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $45. If you are new to Game Pass, you can &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get your first month for $1&lt;/a&gt;, and it will convert to a $15 monthly charge unless you cancel. If you are not a new user of the service but want to renew your subscription for one month only, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1-month-subscription-xbox-one-windows-10-xbox-live-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Eneba is selling a single month for $12.47&lt;/a&gt;. If you want three months but don’t want to be billed automatically, you can grab it for its usual price at places like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-one%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-game-pass-3-month-ultimate-membership%2F11095751.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fmicrosoft-3-months%2Fp%2FN82E16832350399%3FDescription%3DXbox%2520Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate%26cm_re%3DXbox_Game%2520Pass%2520Ultimate-_-32-350-399-_-Product" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZo2dI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tchitw"&gt;Outside of Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft has two separate versions of the service, including one specifically for Xbox consoles, which is probably the better choice for gamers who solely play on the Xbox and are not interested in the other incentives offered by the Ultimate Tier. Again, you can get &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this model for $1 if you are new&lt;/a&gt;. Otherwise, it’s &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%23join" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 a month&lt;/a&gt;, $60 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07BKXDW67?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;six months&lt;/a&gt;, or $112 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07K782P3N?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full-year subscription&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5pUly"&gt;Another subscription available on consoles is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-play?join-now=true" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EA Play&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to a slew of titles published by Electronic Arts. It’s available on a few platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/EA-Access-12-Month-Subscription/dp/B014Q5UNH4/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=EA+Play&amp;amp;qid=1617219222&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5498-CUSA15087_00-PSEAA1M000000000" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;, but the service is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;included with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; now. If you are subscribed to Game Pass Ultimate and buy an EA Play subscription, it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493265/ea-play-xbox-game-pass-release-date-subscription" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;convert to a certain number&lt;/a&gt; of days or months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lh5L5F"&gt;Nintendo subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVh6Q6"&gt;Nintendo Switch Online is a good service for owners of Nintendo’s hybrid console if they want to do the following: play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, or get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era. It comes in two forms: an individual membership, which provides access and perks through a single account, or a family membership, which provides access to the service via the same or multiple Switch consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haNwb6"&gt;You can get a seven-day free trial for both. Otherwise, an individual membership costs &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$4 for one month&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV61ZC9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$8 for three&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 for a full year&lt;/a&gt;. You can do it directly through Nintendo’s eShop on the Switch itself; retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473387011881465#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/nintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership?partner=voxmedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fdigital%2Fsubscriptions%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership%2F176406.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-online-12-month-individual-membership-nintendo-switch-digital%2F-%2FA-78630258&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; also sell three-month or one-year subscriptions. The best deal currently is at Eneba, which is selling &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-3-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months for $7&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;full year for $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jEWRuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JPkA27"&gt;Family Memberships only include a full-year subscription, which you can buy for $35 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736473860075502827#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo eShop&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IcYUKQ"&gt;PC gaming subscription deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qoeGMy"&gt;Xbox Game Pass for PC is available as a standalone service for those with a gaming PC who do not want all of the perks available with Game Pass Ultimate. Like the console version, Game Pass PC is available for $10 a month or $1 for your first month if you are a new user. Typically, retailers sell the PC-only service for three months, which is normally priced at $30. Currently, Eneba has &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-1-month-microsoft-key-global" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one month available&lt;/a&gt; for $8 or &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fxbox-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-3-month-windows-10-store-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months&lt;/a&gt; for $23. &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Game-Pass-For-PC-Microsoft-Windows-10-Digital-Download%2F116004075&amp;amp;subid1=VergeGamingSubscriptionDeals03312021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also has a deal on a three-month subscription for $24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HIGoSB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422524"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hMlkSB"&gt;EA Play is also available on PC, but the prices vary depending on whether you subscribe on Steam or Origin. If you &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriptions/ea#SaleSection_77945" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe to Steam&lt;/a&gt;, it is the same price as consoles ($5 per month, $30 annually). &lt;a href="https://www.origin.com/usa/en-us/store/ea-play" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Origin has EA Play Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which costs $15 monthly or $100 per year. The key biggest difference between EA Play and&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Pro is the Pro version provides unlimited access to the publisher’s latest releases, similar to how Game Pass provides access to Xbox exclusives on the day those titles release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGmZnI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535105/ubisoft-plus-uplay-subscription-service-google-stadia-amazon-luna-pc-gaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ubisoft Plus&lt;/a&gt; (formally UPlay Plus), like EA Play, is a gaming subscription service with a library of games published and developed by Ubisoft. You also receive access to new releases at launch, over 100 games in the library, and Amazon’s Luna and Google’s Stadia cloud gaming services. You can subscribe to a monthly plan, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fubisoftplus%2F%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22348957%2Fbest-video-game-subscription-playstation-plus-xbox-game-pass-nintendo-switch-online-deals-price-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which is $15 each month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fayzzi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422601"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nx27Nw"&gt;Originally released in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription?partner=VoxMedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Humble Choice&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Humble Monthly) is a Humble Bundle gaming subscription. Each month, the company allows subscribers to choose from a curated list of 10 or more DRM-free games, which they can keep forever. Unlike some other services by the company, all of the games are revealed upfront. It comes in &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/checkout?partner=VoxMedia" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Lite ($5 per month), Basic ($15 per month), and Premium ($20 per month). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVTwM0"&gt;Mobile game subscription deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YZZ3M2"&gt;Released in 2019, Apple Arcade has its own dedicated tab located on the App Store. It is available on products that run iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. It costs $5 per month, or you can get a year for just $50. All of the games available on the service are free of in-app purchases and pesky ads and the option to play these games offline. Subscribers can also share access with five other individuals via family sharing. New users can get a one-month free trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kx7Bgn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFNJkG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fintl%2Fen_us%2Fabout%2Fplay-pass%2F#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/a&gt; serves as a direct competitor to Apple Arcade and is available on Android devices. It features over 800 apps and games with no ads or in-app purchases. You can subscribe for $5 monthly or $30 annually. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s Mobileye will launch a fully driverless delivery service in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyyVPOyR-LKOLEQSzv0Lb2MUIQw=/30x0:2610x1720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112364/Udelv_Driven_by_Mobileye_night.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UhdxCh"&gt;Mobileye, the company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a full-scale, fully driverless delivery service starting in 2023. The company, a subsidiary of Intel, is joining forces with self-driving delivery startup Udelv to run this new service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQP6q0"&gt;Deliveries will be made using a new type of cabin-less vehicle called The Transporter. While manufacturing plans are still in flux, Mobileye and Udelv say they will produce 35,000 Transporters between 2023–2028 — a signal of their seriousness to launch a driverless delivery system at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3sCG3"&gt;“This is a real commercial deployment,” Jack Weast, vice president of automated vehicle standards at Mobileye, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Thirty-five thousand units starting in 2023 that will fully integrate our self driving system for commercial use for automated goods delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="t0Z5wy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a real commercial deployment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fKb4N4"&gt;Mobileye’s turn-key self-driving system features a full-sensor suite of 13 cameras, three long-range LiDARs, six short-range LiDARs, and six radar. It also includes the Israeli company’s EyeQ system-on-a-chip and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJ90MT"&gt;The company is also testing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055450/mobileye-self-driving-car-watch-camera-only-intel-jerusalem"&gt;autonomous vehicles in a variety of cities&lt;/a&gt; around the world for the eventual launch of a robotaxi service and has said it would bring its technology to personally owned consumer vehicles by 2025 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2sZLzJ"&gt;“The design of our self driving systems is based on this concept called true redundancy,” Weast said. “Unlike most everyone else, where you need to have your radar, LIDAR, and camera operating in perfect unison in order to operate, we have independent subsystems between our camera systems alone, and then the radar and LIDAR subsystems alone. ...If either one of the subsystems is unable to properly detect an object, the other one will be able to. Then you can provide a better, safer experience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bpvIX"&gt;Udelv is an interesting choice for a partner for Mobileye. One of the few AV startups that has yet to be acquired by a larger company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv has been testing autonomous delivery vans&lt;/a&gt; in a variety of markets across the US over the last few years, including Oklahoma City, Arizona, and the Bay Area in California. Udelv said it has completed 20,000 deliveries for merchants in the cities where it has operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvDBXf"&gt;The company currently uses retrofitted cargo vans to make its deliveries, but starting in 2023, it will start to roll out the cabin-less Transporters as part of its deal with Mobileye. The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers, similar to the drone vehicles we’ve seen from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506125/einride-self-driving-truck-pod-aet-reveal"&gt;Einride&lt;/a&gt;. The vehicle is built on a modular electric platform, or skateboard, that can be adjusted to fit a variety of vehicle chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SLZNKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Transporter is an electric delivery vehicle without room for human drivers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0kIv3h"&gt;Udelv isn’t releasing some pertinent specs for the Transporter, like range, battery size, or the overall weight of the vehicle. The vehicle will be compatible with DC fast charging and will have a top speed of 65 mph. A spokesperson said that Udelv will announce its manufacturing plans for the Transporter at a later date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgIeYX"&gt;While the Transporter will be fully autonomous, it won’t be completely alone in the wilderness. Udelv says the vehicle will have ultra-low-latency teleoperation capabilities, meaning a remote operator can offer a prompt to the vehicle if it gets tripped up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhzrHU"&gt;That said, Weast said the Mobileye / Udelv delivery service won’t be limited by geography when it launches in 2023 — meaning it will be able to drive wherever it needs, in all types of conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmAe0D"&gt;“What this announcement really underscores is the commercial maturity and readiness of the Mobileye self driving system solution,” he said. “It is ready to scale at large, across tens of thousands of vehicles, multiple states, all the retail store partners in all cities, not geofenced or limited in any way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft buys AI speech tech company Nuance for $19.7 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft logo stock 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G2xd47oiKf3dDVrVBs61TM5m8dQ=/3x0:1017x676/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112249/microsoftlogostock1_1020.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaDsZe"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/"&gt;buying AI speech tech firm Nuance for $19.7 billion&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant’s prowess in voice recognition and giving it further leverage in the health care market, where Nuance sells many products. Microsoft will pay $56 per share for Nuance, a 23 percent premium over the company’s closing price last Friday. The deal includes Nuance’s net debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWrE7z"&gt;Nuance is best known for its Dragon software, which uses deep learning to transcribe speech and improves its accuracy over time by adapting to a user’s voice. Nuance has licensed this tech for many services and applications, including, most famously, Apple’s digital assistant Siri. (Though to what degree Siri currently relies on Dragon to answer users’ queries is unclear.) Dragon is an industry leader in terms of transcription accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fabTd"&gt;The $19.7 billion acquisition of Nuance is Microsoft’s second-largest behind its purchase of LinkedIn in 2016 for $26 billion. It comes at a time when speech tech is improving rapidly, thanks to the deep learning boom in AI, and there are simultaneously more opportunities for its use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1zBEx4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Digital transcription has improved rapidly in recent years, thanks to advances in AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ELAYEM"&gt;Digital transcription has become more reliable in a range of settings, from medical consultations to board meetings and university lectures. The uptick in remote work has also created new opportunities. With so many meetings taking place via video, it is easier to offer customers transcriptions via software integrated directly into these calls. Zoom, for example, offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;automatic transcription&lt;/a&gt; via integration with third-party services like Otter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hhsj3s"&gt;For Microsoft, which makes roughly two-thirds of its revenue from enterprise software sales and cloud computing, improving its transcription services for scenarios like these makes complete sense. The company could integrate Nuance’s technology into its existing software, like Teams, or offer it independently as part of its Azure cloud business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klm9uJ"&gt;The immediate focus, though, will be on health care, where the two companies have already worked together. &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/nuance-exam-room-of-the-future/"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, they announced a “strategic partnership” to use Nuance’s software to digitize health records for Microsoft’s clients. Nuance’s health tech, including its Dragon Medical One platform, which is tuned to identify medical terminology, is reportedly used by more than half a million physicians worldwide and in 77 percent of US hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vibdWE"&gt;“By augmenting the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare with Nuance’s solutions, as well as the benefit of Nuance’s expertise and relationships with EHR systems providers, Microsoft will be better able to empower healthcare providers through the power of ambient clinical intelligence and other Microsoft cloud services,” said Microsoft in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVS7WO"&gt;“Nuance provides the AI layer at the healthcare point of delivery and is a pioneer in the real-world application of enterprise AI,” said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2021/04/12/microsoft-accelerates-industry-cloud-strategy-for-healthcare-with-the-acquisition-of-nuance/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “AI is technology’s most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application. Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud in Healthcare and Nuance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzzcRi"&gt;News of the Nuance acquisition was first reported over the weekend by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s the latest example of Microsoft’s purchasing spree. Last month, the company completed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21449178/microsoft-xbox-bethesda-zenimax-media-acquisition-xbox-game-pass"&gt;$7.5 billion acquisition of games company&lt;/a&gt; ZeniMax. Last year, it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352309/microsoft-tiktok-acquisition-deal-why-us-countries-data"&gt;considering an acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of social video app TikTok, and the company is also reportedly in “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352028/microsoft-discord-acquisition-analysis-report"&gt;exclusive talks&lt;/a&gt;” to purchase communications app Discord.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot has been taught to pee beer on command</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yT93Vb9vbniBMJbrcEmkiESLolQ=/59x0:542x322/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112240/spot_pee_beer.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="arLwyn"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ robot dog Spot exists in two realities. In one, it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;terrifying harbinger&lt;/a&gt; of a dystopian future when robots hunt and kill humans. In the other, it’s the plaything of YouTubers who &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/tqsy9Wtr1qE"&gt;teach this robot quadruped&lt;/a&gt; to “piss beer” on command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lz3Lel"&gt;The latter example comes from the talented, imaginative, piss-focused YouTuber Michael Reeves, who managed to get his hands on a unit before using his tech expertise and dirty mind to turn Spot into the ultimate drinking buddy. With some quick code and a few feet of tubing, Spot can identify cups on the floor, position itself over them, and release a stream of &lt;s&gt;piss&lt;/s&gt; beer into the awaiting receptacle. It’s the future Isaac Asimov could only dream of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDnLEU"&gt;As Reeves notes in the video, it’s hardly a polished product. “Piss bot is working flawlessly. 35 percent of the time,” he says. But it’s still an absolutely amazing thing to make.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z9d6gQrra9oF7HtGLSaPBAtxYtg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22437703/spot_pee_beer.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Video by Michael Reeves / YouTube&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A little wide of the mark there, Spot, but everyone makes mistakes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b7J3T9"&gt;Now, just to put on my “I’m a journalist, and I like to overthink things” hat for a second: what also fascinates me about this video is what it means for Boston Dynamics. This is a firm that has previously worked to tightly control footage of its machines and their public reception. Since making Spot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;commercially available&lt;/a&gt;, though, it’s had to relinquish some of this control, leading to instances where its machinery is used in ways it doesn’t approve of (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295091/mschf-drop-boston-dynamics-spot-paintball-gun-art-gallery"&gt;equipping Spot with a paintball gun&lt;/a&gt;). This includes non-jokey military uses. When we reported on the French army using Spot in simulated combat exercises &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, Boston Dynamics told us it was unaware these particular tests were being carried out (though it did know the French military had access to its machines). Is greater access to Spot going to create more problems for the company in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2FJUL"&gt;Spot is definitely not easy to get a hold of. It costs $75,000 for one. But it’s plainly much more accessible than it was a year ago. That has the potential to not only create PR headaches for Boston Dynamics but also genuine enforcement issues. How much visibility does the company have over its robots and how they’re being used? What happens if someone uses it in the wrong way? This doesn’t have to be malicious for people to get hurt. I, for one, cringed watching Reeves grapple with Spot by putting his hands &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; the machine’s joints at around the 12-minute mark. Those are called “pinch points” for a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVaDUk"&gt;So right now, Spot exists in two realities: as a threat and as a joke. What happens if the line between them blurs? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flappy Bird clone hacked into playable macOS push notification</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/07-hKgcJXAJlQCnfNrD3PxsoCD0=/151x0:2310x1439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69112203/msedge_L9EISOzg3c.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video shows the game playable in a push notification.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: Twitter / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913" target="_blank"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJnCPF"&gt;In a new video, a developer has shown off a playable version of viral hit &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS push notification. It’s the work of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913"&gt;Neil Sardesai&lt;/a&gt;, who previously &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/mac-pong-on-a-dock-icon-is-cute-as-hell"&gt;made headlines&lt;/a&gt; with a clip of &lt;em&gt;Pong&lt;/em&gt; running inside a macOS app icon. The hack has yet to receive a public release, but it’s still a neat proof of concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIC5Ez"&gt;According to Sardesai, the feature works by loading a web version of the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380942741224484871"&gt;into the notification&lt;/a&gt;. This playable version is technically a browser-based clone of the original app &lt;a href="https://playcanv.as/p/2OlkUaxF/"&gt;made by Will Eastcott of PlayCanvas&lt;/a&gt;. Sardesai notes that the feature relies on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649830175932421"&gt;UserNotificationsUI framework&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by Apple with macOS Big Sur, though he says it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1381008674060177418"&gt;should also work on iOS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="enCvwY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Did you know you can put a whole game inside of a push notification &lt;a href="https://t.co/LlMx2AjvHH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LlMx2AjvHH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Neil Sardesai (@neilsardesai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neilsardesai/status/1380649026186534913?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RoN6H7"&gt;Distracting notifications are bad enough when you’re trying to get some work done, but combining them with a playable version of an infamously addictive game is the final straw. Sardesai doesn’t appear to have released his work publicly for anyone to try out, which is probably a good thing for the sake of our sanity. After all, the last thing humanity needs right now is for our devices to be able to compel us to play several rounds of &lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt; with just a simple notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxYSuF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/em&gt;’s addictive nature was cited by its developer as one of the reasons he removed it from the App Store after it became a hit in 2014. “It happened to become an addictive product. I think it has become a problem,” Dong Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"&gt;said in an interview at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Although the original game is gone from the App Store, numerous clones have surfaced in its wake, including an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761627/flappy-royale-bird-fortnite-battle-mobile-gaming-developers"&gt;excellent battle royale version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing an Apple TV with a built-in camera and speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm0pc9afyC78oZ3WRjASjHfdkLQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69111969/akrales_170919_1976_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple TV 4K, released in 2017.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QnHWwj"&gt;Apple is reportedly developing a new TV accessory that combines elements of its Apple TV with a HomePod speaker and camera for video calls, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-12/apple-working-on-combined-tv-box-speaker-to-revive-home-efforts?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside it, Apple is also said to be working on a smart speaker with a display, similar to Amazon’s Echo Show or Google’s Nest Hub. Development of both devices is said to be in its early stages, with plans subject to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekAI8e"&gt;The unannounced TV accessory would have the hardware to fulfill a variety of roles. As a TV accessory it could offer access to games and the streaming video services supported by Apple TV today; while its built-in speaker would likely be an upgrade over those found in most TV sets, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459521/roku-streambar-soundbar-compact-streaming-bluetooth-spotify-connect-tv-audio"&gt;Roku’s soundbars&lt;/a&gt;. It would also support HomePod features like music playback and Siri voice assistant controls, much like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/23/18637225/sonos-google-assistant-how-to-set-up-one-beam-home"&gt;Sonos Beam offers&lt;/a&gt; with Alexa and Google Assistant. Finally, the camera would let it serve as a video calling device &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871173/facebook-portal-camera-price-release-date-availability"&gt;like a Facebook Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20913653/facebook-portal-10-inch-2019-review-price-specs-features-whatsapp-video-calling"&gt; TV&lt;/a&gt;. It’s potentially a lot of functionality in a single Apple device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AbEOj6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A HomePod, Apple TV, and video conferencing device in one&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3JFsFd"&gt;The second device is a smart display similar to what competitors Amazon and Google already offer, combining features of an iPad and HomePod. Apple’s work on the device was previously &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-22/apple-homepod-mini-secret-sensor-for-smart-home-thermostats?sref=ExbtjcSG#lazy-img-370126915:~:text=It%20has%20also%20been%20developing%20new,such%20a%20launch%20isn%E2%80%99t%20imminent.%20Apple"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt;. Like the TV accessory, this device would also offer video chat features, but via its built-in screen rather than a connected TV. Apple is said to have explored using a robotic arm to rotate the display and track users, similar to Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454117/amazon-new-echo-show-10-alexa-smart-display-moving-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;2020 Echo Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0wj9z"&gt;While Apple’s existing smart home devices have focused on one or two key areas, the functionality offered by the two rumored devices would be much broader. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Apple merged its HomePod and Apple TV engineering groups in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BZsva"&gt;Apple’s smart home lineup could use a shot in the arm. The company hasn’t updated its Apple TV hardware lineup since 2017, and it recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22328436/apple-discontinues-original-homepod-mini"&gt;discontinued its high-end HomePod&lt;/a&gt; to focus on the more affordable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt;. A hardware update for the Apple TV has been rumored &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-22/apple-tv-is-missing-the-moment?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;for several months now&lt;/a&gt;, and recently discovered code suggests it might include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22369056/apple-tv-2021-120hz-refresh-rate-support-4k-gaming-arcade"&gt;support for 120Hz refresh rates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
