    <title>The art of upcycling old sneakers into high-fashion corsets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Side by side photos of models wearing FRISKMEGOOD corsets made of sneakers." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHK0YtsR2KXaCBUpMP9_7bvI2-M=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948254/friskmegoodcomp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Designer Cierra Boyd’s FRISKMEGOOD clothing line reworks upcycled sneakers into futuristic fashion.&lt;/em&gt; | Photos: FRISKMEGOOD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fjbHuK"&gt;Modern fashion is fraught with wasted product, so some designers are thinking about ways to transform these unwanted goods into artistic pieces meant for the runway. One of those is &lt;a href="https://www.friskmegood.com/"&gt;FRISKMEGOOD&lt;/a&gt;, a futuristic brand that creates upcycled high fashion and editorial pieces out of used or deadstock sneakers and other secondhand finds. Owner and designer Cierra Boyd found success on her &lt;a href="https://www.depop.com/friskmegood/"&gt;Depop shop&lt;/a&gt; when her signature designs — corsets and bodysuits made from old or unused shoes — were featured on its Explore page. Now, her brand’s ballooning popularity has enabled Boyd to pursue opportunities beyond her online shop.     &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NAhwGh"&gt;Boyd, based in Cleveland, Ohio, now lives and works in her studio apartment after three years of growing her business and creativity from her mom’s house. While she hopes to eventually expand, everything one can find on her shop and &lt;a href="https://www.friskmegood.com/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has been handmade by her. Her corsets and bodysuits have gained her followers on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/friskmegood/?hl=en"&gt;social media&lt;/a&gt;, been presented in fashion shows, and most notably, worn by American rapper &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CKhQc7AHC6e/?igshid=17nzsyww89o9u"&gt;Dream Doll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hw8QU"&gt;The corsets and bodysuits aren’t all that Boyd upcycles, though. I reached out to her to chat about sustainable fashion, how she creates her sneaker designs, and what she has planned for FRISKMEGOOD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmSWRK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZDR5v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the inspiration behind the bodysuits and corsets made out of repurposed sneakers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev5vvf"&gt;It kind of came about all by chance. I was in a design competition in 2018, in Cleveland. It was Fashion Mania 2k19, and I was given three challenges. One goal was to create something without using fabric. I was stumped. I did not know what to do. I had everything done with the other two challenges, but it was getting down to the wire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNf5cj"&gt;Luckily, one night I was watching Vice while I was designing and an episode came on about a guy who made a mask out of sneakers. I was like, wait, what if I made a top out of sneakers? So, I tried to make a top and it didn’t look right. I moved it down a little and I was like, “Oh, well this is kind of cute as a corset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNLJaW"&gt;I just rolled with that and I put it on Depop. People bought it! I was super surprised but it also gave me confidence. At the time I really didn’t know how to feel about it, but I just put it out there anyway to see how people will respond. The response was overwhelming. So I never stopped making them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZZJxs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After realizing people liked the sneaker corsets, how did you begin to source your material?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugdV2I"&gt;At the beginning, I was using stuff in my attic and stuff that I had around the house. When I started to deplete that inventory, I did go to thrift shops. Recently, for the bodysuits, I found a place here in Cleveland that has deadstock sneakers. They have sneakers that have been in their stores since the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9HrSy"&gt;A lot of their inventory is extremely old, the sneakers are falling apart. I’m not gonna lie, one time I found mouse droppings in shoes. It’s really crazy and rough in there. It’s a lot, but they give me the sneakers that are damaged or the average customer wouldn’t buy. I use that to upcycle them into the bodysuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yw7AS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you even find this place?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhHPNL"&gt;It’s funny because it’s right down the street from my house, and never in my life have I gone in that warehouse. I used to go to elementary school around that area. I would pass that place my entire life and never went there. Then one day I was like, let me just see what they got in there. It was like a gold mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOZ2ET"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you are choosing your shoes or the deadstock, do you choose the shoes with the design in mind?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYwYH6"&gt;I work a lot different from other designers. Some designers draw their designs beforehand, but for me, I usually let the materials give me the story instead of vice versa. I let the clothes tell me the story. I have to see it to know what I’m going to do with it. It’s really like a visual thing. When I see it I’d be like, oh, that’d be a cute bodysuit, and then just get five pairs of them if I can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOb8f7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you ever run into the issue of not having enough to make something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZDQFsw"&gt;Oh yeah, definitely. The warehouse is so unpredictable. I have to bring my mom with me most of the time to help me because it’s a lot to sort through. I’m literally on the floor going through all the shoes on the bottom, searching for a match. It can be stressful, but if there is a match, I always get it. Like I said, I need like five or more [shoes] to do what I really want to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Omyxd3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a certain size in mind when you’re looking for them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYJ7il"&gt;Everything is so random. I usually just go with whatever I find, but if I am looking for something that’s more like a plus-size look, I’ll go for size 10 and up. Usually for smalls and mediums, you can even use kids’ shoes. [Size] five is usually the lowest I’ll go — five or four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWTpUt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you are thinking about size, are you making pieces so your size range is inclusive or are you making them for a specific client?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgnkTa"&gt;What I do ... nothing is planned. If I do find that 10 or 12, you know, that’s perfect, but if I don’t, then I don’t. It’s kind of like an “it is what it is” situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooIjds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other types of clothing or fabrics do you upcycle?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F04T1e"&gt;I’ll use anything from bedsheets to other materials, like maybe hoodies and sweatshirts. Another thing that I just started doing is called tufting. Which is kind of like the art of making rugs, but instead of making rugs I put tufted art on the front of it. It’s a fairly new thing and I haven’t even dropped it yet, but basically it’s made out of yarn. And what I’m trying to do with that is give a new vibe and a new feel to an old, blank, unloved sweatshirt, T-shirt, or thrifted item. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njxhr0"&gt;Even jeans. I use jeans, denim and socks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rpUtVJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time goes into making a piece?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CuMIV6"&gt;It depends on which piece you’re talking about. I usually do things in bulk, too. So, for a bodysuit, I’ll buy like five different styles. I’ll work on five at once. That whole process can take two to three days. For the tufting, depending on how many I’m doing, what it is, it can take like one to four days to do. It takes up a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrfQ3U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a personal favorite from your collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2JI4M"&gt;It’s so hard. I have so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqgJ9s"&gt;One of my favorites that I’ve done, that I’m proud of, is my Air Force One bodysuit. That’s for plus-size women or anybody who identifies as a woman. My uncle donated those shoes to me. I didn’t have to go out and even buy those. It was just pretty much perfect, so that’s definitely my favorite, for sure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcIOe6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You sell your clothes on Depop now. Is that where you started?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BEEfF"&gt;Yes, that is where I started. Depop is how people found out about me. Before Depop I was on Instagram trying to figure out, how do I get more people to see it? When Depop came along, I ended up getting pictures on the Explore page and the Explore page puts you literally right smack dab in the front. So when people started to find me from that it was a chain reaction, and more people started finding me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5pEnuO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you see Depop as the hub for futuristic fashion like yours? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwKH2a"&gt;Yes, it definitely reminds me of if you could just go to a worldwide thrift store online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42INiS"&gt;I joined their Now / Next program, which is an incubator-program-slash-grant that they gave me. I get mentorship and money towards working on my Depop shop. They’ve given me so many chances to be on the forefront of their platform. I’ll be on their Instagram page. It’s just crazy how much support they have given me. They’ve invited me to Depop Live, which is an event that, pre-COVID, you can sell your stuff in person. My stuff sold out. They have been a complete blessing in disguise for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LU6UYQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have any future plans for FRISKMEGOOD?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwbhby"&gt;I have a lot of future plans. Everything is in the works right now. We are a global brand right now. We definitely do get a lot of international customers. I hope on growing, expanding, and figuring out how I can take FRISKMEGOOD to the next level. You know, how to get my stuff on more celebrities. I have a showroom now that houses my pieces, so that way I can get more celebrity visibility with my brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7TXvgu"&gt;Everything is falling in line, slowly but surely. I hope this year I can find more innovative ways to create fashion, to continue to change the way that people view sustainable fashion. I just want to change the way people think when it comes to sustainability. When you think sustainability, you don’t automatically think luxury at all. I’m really trying to show people that sustainable and old pieces that might never have been loved again, can be loved again. It can be high fashion and it can be luxury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tlg2QF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WN9AV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqoJ3U"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZE3sh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to create a signature for PDF documents on a PC </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Surface Laptop Go on a table angled slightly to the left." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UZ9mdUxw-DkKVmIqP29-0LLQBPA=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948215/twarren-surfacelaptopgo-7.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALZBsW"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents. (PDF stands for Portable Document Format; it is a standard created by Adobe in the early 1990s that allows paper documents to be turned into exact digital copies.) These days, hard copy paperwork is fast becoming the exception rather than the rule. However, even digital documents have to be signed. You can do it the long way — print those documents out, sign them, and then scan them back into your computer — or you can create a digital signature and place it directly on the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isjki5"&gt;Unfortunately, while Windows doesn’t offer a built-in PDF signing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321383/signature-pdf-mac-pdf-how-to-preview"&gt;the way a Mac does&lt;/a&gt;, there are third-party apps you can download that will give you the same ability. In this case, I’m using Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, which is Adobe’s free PDF reader. Here’s how to set it up and use it to sign your PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="SgeMF3"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fget.adobe.com%2Freader%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22323097%2Fpdf-signature-windows-pc-adobe-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download Adobe Acrobat Reader DC&lt;/a&gt;. Adobe has the unfortunate tendency to encourage people to download excess apps, so make sure you uncheck all the additional installations that may pop up on the page: in my case, it was two McAfee apps and Acrobat’s Chrome extension. (You can install this last one later if you think it might be useful.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fyH4Ve"&gt;After you click on “Download Adobe Reader,” you can start the install by clicking on the downloaded .EXE file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/niGsIsy1D5YvmE7KouzVOkm-ru0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360298/adobe1___Copy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to uncheck Adobe’s promotional offers before downloading Acrobat Reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wknfyV"&gt;At the end of the installation, Acrobat Reader DC will ask if you want to make Adobe Acrobat Reader your default PDF application. Up to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BW88IR"&gt;Once it’s installed, Acrobat Reader will open. Look for “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” in the main window. Click on that and then click on “Select a File” to choose a PDF file to work on. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start by selecting “Fill &amp;amp;amp; Sign,” and then choosing the PDF file you want to work with" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aejRWsys0IOOYznD9lg8crU2fk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360300/adobe10.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start by selecting “Fill &amp;amp; Sign,” and then choosing the PDF file you want to work with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="71mubA"&gt;Alternatively, you can open the file first (by going to “File” &amp;gt; “Open”) and then select the “Fill &amp;amp; Sign” feature from the app’s right-hand column. (If you don’t see any labels under the icons, it’s the one that looks like a pen in the act of writing.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HoZ2ay"&gt;A new window will ask “What do you want to do?” Click on the “Fill and sign” button under the left-hand picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Fill and sign”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IUBamFlkK849IGpmp16-D9ECH0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360323/adobe5.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Fill and sign.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="r5zYEz"&gt;Your document will come up in Acrobat. Click on the “Sign” icon (another pen) in the top line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D8AxRd"&gt;Click on “Add Signature.” (If you already have added a signature, you can use the “Add Initials” choice to save a second signature, if you wish.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOATBa_airg9-mBWX2dJMv-TNkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360365/adobe6.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Add Signature.” Once you’ve saved your signature, it will appear on this drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="EdgQjv"&gt;A pop-up window will give you three ways to sign your document: type your name (Adobe supplies you with several handwritten-looking fonts), draw your signature (either using your touchpad or directly on a touchscreen), or upload an image of your signature. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JdYWBB"&gt;However you create your signature, if you will want to use it in the future, make sure the “Save signature” box is checked. Then click on “Apply.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are several ways you can create a signature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HGmXg75kGQyZue77CYS5TfEVabI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360374/adobe7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are several ways you can create a signature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="ImiYmj"&gt;Once you’ve hit “Apply,” your PDF document will be back. Place your new signature where you want it on the document and left-click. You can then change the size or placement of the signature if you wish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can place your signature where you want it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IeZnhslHjxqUAMB30lt8pma3a-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360383/adobe8.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can place your signature where you want it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ldRjRL"&gt;And you’re done! Now, if you want to add your signature to a PDF, just open your document using Adobe Acrobat Reader and click on the “Sign” icon. You can then select your saved signature and place it where you need it on your PDF document.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Your signature is now available whenever you need it" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kd5_FmENt_zLnAnHO_m1CQeh-rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360852/adobe12.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your signature is now available whenever you need it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ojzgTu"&gt;Adobe Acrobat Reader DC is, of course, not the only app that you can use to read and / or edit a PDF document. There are a variety of other apps out there with free versions that will let you do basic PDF work, such as &lt;a href="https://app.hellosign.com/info/pricing?_ga=2.98293343.1191478015.1615406363-173908718.1615236989"&gt;HelloSign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://smallpdf.com/sign-pdf"&gt;Smallpdf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.docsketch.com/"&gt;Docsketch&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of those free versions come with limitations — for example, both HelloSign and Docsketch let you sign up to three documents a month, while Smallpdf lets you process up to two documents per day. Adobe Reader doesn’t have any limitations on your ability to sign documents, but if you want to create a PDF, or export it to another format, you’ll have to get the Pro version.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Xbox Series X / S consoles are in stock again at Target</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uB33gQ8koCixzJA9CbqMzexkqpE=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948041/twarren_200909_4177_0030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VDZvv5"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-s-console%2F-%2FA-80790842&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles are some of the most sought-after consoles to buy right now. Those looking for another shot to get either console can buy one right now at Target. You will have the option to pay for either console in full or through Xbox All Access, allowing you to get either console upfront at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HF1Mn1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323661/sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-restock-target"&gt;Similar to the PS5 restocks that went up earlier this morning&lt;/a&gt;, Target is limiting the purchase of these next-gen consoles to in-store pickup only. Not every store has the next-gen Xbox hardware in stock and the ones that do have a very limited supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwoxv5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g4d2am2QVwE2P1xHRfOjyrHAKCk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362437/Screenshot__234_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fewer than five units are available at my local Target.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BLuT14"&gt;Once you secured your next-gen Xbox, I would suggest stocking up on games and accessories that will allow you to get the most out of your new console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynkRau"&gt;Several of the most popular games to play on these consoles include third-party titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, some popular Xbox One titles like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhalo-the-master-chief-collection%2F9MT8PTGVHX2P%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fgears-5%2Fc2kdnlt2h7dm%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears 5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have all received graphical updates that take advantage of the next-gen hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sah8hS"&gt;Of course, if you are unsure what games to buy, you could always subscribe to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;, which gives you access to a slew of first- and third-party titles from various developers and publishers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xmQCoE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367357"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="PbVSAl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ce6rHG"&gt;A must-have accessory I think is worth buying is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;, more so if you are planning to play local cooperative games with loved ones as the console only comes with one controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2zGBUP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="eglaXe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="FtJmt6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Gr17X"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/28/15081398/facebook-stories-snapchat-camera-direct"&gt;introduced Stories&lt;/a&gt; to its platform four years ago, mostly as a way to encourage people to post content that wasn’t highly produced or necessarily photogenic. Now, it’s giving some users a chance to make money through that content. The company announced a test today that’ll allow some creators to place ads that look like stickers into their stories and receive a cut of the resulting revenue. The initial test is “very small,” Facebook says, but it hopes to expand it “soon” and then apply the technology to all short-form videos on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTANnA"&gt;In a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Yoav Arnstein, director of product management, says he can’t share creator or advertiser partners because the test is still in the early conceptual phase. He said the broader idea, though, is to give advertisers a natural place to fit their content, so, for example, if someone posts a video from Yosemite National Park, a sticker could advertise a local business. The contextual relevance will likely be key to making these advertisements successful, Arnstein says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6EwUA7"&gt;The story stickers are only one of the company’s various updates to its creator platform today. It’s also making its usual in-stream ads available for shorter videos. Previously, only three-minute or longer videos could monetize with these ads, but now, one-minute-long videos can receive ads, which will be placed 30 seconds into the content. Videos longer than three minutes can place ads as soon as 45 seconds into the programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00KAE8"&gt;To qualify for these in-stream ads, pages that publish them must have 600,000 total minutes viewed&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;from any combination of video uploads — on-demand, live, and previously live — in the last 60 days, as well as five or more active video uploads or previously live videos. Meanwhile, live video creators now must have 60,000 live minutes viewed in the last 60 days to monetize through in-stream ads, in addition to meeting the video-on-demand program requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRcDxy"&gt;Facebook is also spending $7 million to promote its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687603/facebook-creators-stars-subscriptions-supporter-groups"&gt;Stars feature&lt;/a&gt;, which lets viewers of live content tip with virtual stars, which each pay a creator a cent. The company will make free Stars available during certain live streams, and viewers can them send to the videos’ hosts. The team will also introduce virtual gifts that viewers can send. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAAi8U"&gt;“We want to enable more people to actually go and experience this delight of actually going and supporting a creator, and we think this is a relatively new behavior that we want to make more ubiquitous across the app, and we think this is a great way to do that,” Arnstein says about why Facebook is investing in the Stars. “We think that can help also incentivize creators to experiment more with the type of content and the type of engagement directly with fans that will actually enable and incentivize this type of direct support from fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzpUOW"&gt;Finally, Facebook is expanding its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21239863/facebook-live-paid-video-charge-stream-access-events"&gt;paid live events&lt;/a&gt; to 24 additional countries and its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/tools/fan-subs"&gt;fan subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; to 10 more countries. The company won’t collect revenue from either of those features through at least August 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd4PFi"&gt;All of these various announcements clearly add up to the idea that Facebook wants to monetize as much creator content as possible through ads. The Stories sticker has potentially the biggest implications, particularly for Instagram, and could usher in a world that’s slightly less focused on full-screen ads and more on those integrated into the content itself.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Building the ultimate retro computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYmmD9CaG42QjKfInOJHCh4iIHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947935/sbyford_210303_4461_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The MiSTer FPGA project recreates classic hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1nZQ3Y"&gt;Although I assembled it myself, and its software all comes from an open-source DIY project, in many ways my MiSTer is the most versatile computer I own. It’s a shapeshifting wonderbox that can change its own logic to make itself run like countless other machines as accurately as possible. From old arcade boards to early PCs to vintage consoles, MiSTer developers are devoted to helping it turn into an ever-expanding range of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iqIjr"&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to use computer software or hardware that is no longer available for sale, you’ve probably run into emulation before. It’s a huge field that often involves a ton of people working on a technically challenging feat: how to write software that lets one computer run code that was written for another. But there’s only so much traditional emulators can do. There are always inherent compromises and complexities involved in getting your current hardware to run software it was never designed to handle. Emulated operating systems or video games often encounter slowdown, latency, and bugs you’d never have encountered with the original devices. So what if there was a way to alter the hardware itself? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwrAsQ"&gt;Well, that’s &lt;a href="https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki"&gt;MiSTer&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an open-source project built upon field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, which means it makes use of hardware that can be reconfigured after the fact. While traditional CPUs are fixed from the point of manufacture, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to work as if they came right off the conveyor belt with the actual silicon you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lraXVX"&gt;What this means is, you’re not tricking a processor into believing it’s something else, you’re setting it up to run that way from the start. A MiSTer system can theoretically run software from the NES to the Neo Geo, to the Apple II or Acorn Archimedes, and deliver responsive, near-as-dammit accurate performance next to what you’d get from the actual devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L03Iho"&gt;Of course, it’s not as easy as that makes it sound. In order to program an FPGA to act like a computer from three decades ago, you have to intimately understand the original hardware. And that’s what makes MiSTer one of the technically coolest DIY projects going today, building on the knowledge of developers around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iokMOyjxIrNK7EsXsujij4ReT0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360565/sbyford_210303_4461_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The DE10-Nano sandwiched between the I/O and USB hub boards.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zclj9O"&gt;FPGAs aren’t new technology. Two early companies in the field (sorry) were Altera, now owned by Intel, and Xilinx, now part of AMD. The two have competed since the 1980s for market share in programmable logic devices, largely serving enterprise customers. One of the biggest advantages of FPGAs on an industrial scale is that companies can iterate their software design on hardware before they need to manufacture the final silicon. FPGAs are widely used to develop embedded systems, for example, because the software and the hardware can be designed near-concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sENDm"&gt;You might be familiar with FPGAs if you’ve come across Analogue’s boutique console clones, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967790/analogue-mega-sg-sega-genesis-mega-drive-price-release-date"&gt;Mega Sg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/2/7/16981722/analogue-super-nt-snes-nintendo-review"&gt;Super Nt&lt;/a&gt;. Those use FPGAs programmed in a certain way to replicate a single, specific piece of hardware, so you can use your original physical cartridges with them and get an experience that’s very close to the actual consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBRSZ9"&gt;The MiSTer project is built around more accessible FPGA hardware than you’d find in commercial or enterprise applications. The core of the system is an FPGA board called the DE10-Nano, produced by another Intel-owned company called Terasic that’s based out of Taiwan. It was originally intended for students as a way to teach themselves how to work with FPGAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXnSLX"&gt;The DE10-Nano looks somewhat similar to a Raspberry Pi — it’s a tiny motherboard that ships without a case and is designed to be expanded. The hardware includes an Altera Cyclone V with two ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores, 1GB of DDR3 SDRAM, an HDMI out, a microSD card slot, a USB-A port, and Ethernet connectivity. It runs a Linux-based OS out of the box and sells for about $135, or $99 to students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0pSbh"&gt;MiSTer is inspired by MiST, an earlier project that made use of an Altera FPGA board to recreate the Atari ST. But the DE10-Nano is cheaper, more powerful, and expandable, which is why project leader Alexey Melnikov used it as the basis for MiSTer when development started a few years back. Melnikov also designed MiSTer-specific daughterboards that enhance the DE10-Nano’s capability and make a finished machine a lot more versatile; the designs are open-source, so anyone is free to manufacture and sell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8PNMi3DnRqf5lUPfAZzYZda74A8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360563/sbyford_210303_4461_0016.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2CjdL7B_tD-KCE0IodMwYSqZX2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360561/sbyford_210303_4461_0013.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8Xdgeb48VBOBpcqBU7SIiKjUCE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360564/sbyford_210303_4461_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NjmeNpbbReiHLvRBv9utR5KhXwE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360560/sbyford_210303_4461_0011.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O6GmXJ"&gt;You can run MiSTer on a single DE10-Nano, but it’s not recommended, because the board alone will only support a few of the cores available. (A “core” is a re-creation of a specific console or computer designed to run on the MiSTer platform.) The one upgrade that should be considered essential is a 128MB stick of SDRAM, which gives MiSTer enough memory at the right speed to run anything released for the platform to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQprUF"&gt;Beyond that, you’ll probably want a case, assuming you’d rather not run open circuitry exposed to the elements. There are various case designs available, many of which are intended for use with other MiSTer-specific add-ons that vertically attach to the DE10-Nano. An I/O board isn’t necessary for most cores, for example, but it adds a VGA port along with digital and analog audio out, which is useful for various setups. (A lot of MiSTer users prefer to hook up their systems to CRT TVs to make the most of the authentic output and low latency.) You can add a heatsink or a fan, which can be a good idea if you want to run the system for extended periods of time. And there’s a USB hub board that adds seven USB-A ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ckmIgq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Customization is part of the fun with MiSTer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Bx71x"&gt;For my setup, I ordered the DE10-Nano, a 128MB SDRAM stick, a VGA I/O board with a fan, a USB hub board, and a case designed for that precise selection of hardware. These largely came from different sources and took varying amounts of time to show up; you can order the DE10-Nano from countless computer retailers, but other MiSTer accessories involve diving into a cottage industry of redesigns and resellers. Half of my parts arrived in a battered box from Portugal filled with shredded paper and loosely attached bubble wrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZuVG9"&gt;MiSTer accessories are based on Melnikov’s original designs, but since the project is open-source, many sellers customize their own versions. My case, for example, includes a patch cable that hooks directly into the IO board to control its lighting, while some others require you to route the LEDs yourself. The USB board, meanwhile, came with a bridge to the DE10-Nano that seemed to be a different height from most others, which meant I had to improvise a little with screw placements. Nothing I ordered came with instructions, so it did take some time to figure out what should go where, but everything worked fine in the end. The only other thing I had to do was go buy a small hex screwdriver for the final screws in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r59HmE"&gt;That’s part of the fun with MiSTer. There’s a base specification that everything works around, but you’re still ultimately assembling your own FPGA computer, and you can adjust the build as much or as little as you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x0zXEu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Analogue’s console clones are a way to preserve gaming’s past","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2Rz3u4"&gt;Once your hardware is set, you need to install the MiSTer software. There are a few ways to do this, and you’ll want to dig around &lt;a href="https://misterfpga.org"&gt;forums&lt;/a&gt; and GitHub for a while so you know what you’re doing, but the method I went with was simple in the end — essentially, you format your microSD card with an installer package, put it into the DE10-Nano, plug in an Ethernet cable and a USB keyboard, power on the system, and it’ll download all of the available cores. Your SD card will then be set up to boot the MiSTer OS directly, and you can run another script to make sure everything’s updated with the most recent versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ls6EvK"&gt;The MiSTer OS is very simple, with a default background that looks like pixelated TV static and a basic menu in a monospaced font that lets you select from lists of console and computer cores. The first thing I did was load some old Game Boy Advance ROMs I dumped well over a decade ago, because for some reason Nintendo doesn’t want to sell them for the Switch. (Please sell them for the Switch, Nintendo.) The performance felt about as authentic as I could’ve expected, except for the fact that I was looking at a 4K TV instead of a tiny screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baUW4g"&gt;My main reason for getting into MiSTer is to have a hardware-based way to access the parts of computer history that I missed, or to revisit forgotten platforms that I was around for. I knew that computer systems like the Apple II and the Amiga were big gaps in my knowledge, so it’s great to have a little box that can run like either of them on command. I’ve also been getting into the MSX platform, which was popular in Japan in the ’80s. My next rainy-day project is to work on an install of RISC OS, the Acorn operating system that was on the first computers I ever used at school in the UK. (You can actually still &lt;a href="http://www.riscos.com/shop/products/101/index.htm"&gt;buy&lt;/a&gt; licensed ROM copies of various versions of the OS, which was a neat surprise.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38N-nbVAPuvUTYWoyMA7-xU3kYw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360566/sbyford_210310_4461_0019.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2bE1Sv"&gt;MiSTer development is a vibrant scene. &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/FPGAMiSTer/posts"&gt;Melnikov has a Patreon&lt;/a&gt; that’s updated several times a week with improvements he’s made to various cores, but there are lots of other people contributing to the project on a daily or weekly basis. A colleague introduced me to the work of &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/topapate/posts"&gt;Jose Tejada&lt;/a&gt;, for example, who’s based in Spain and has made a ton of progress on replicating old Capcom arcade machine boards. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/laxer3a"&gt;another project&lt;/a&gt; aiming to get the original PlayStation running, marking the biggest step yet into 3D hardware on MiSTer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5QXVl"&gt;FPGAs are often talked about as if they’re a silver bullet for perfect emulation, but that’s really not the case — at least, not without a lot of effort. Anything that runs perfectly on MiSTer, or as close to perfectly as is otherwise imperceptible, is the result of a ton of work by talented programmers who have spent time figuring out the original hardware and applying the knowledge to their cores. Just read &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/update-35-its-48013713"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; from the FPGA PSX Project about what it took to get &lt;em&gt;Ridge Racer&lt;/em&gt; running on MiSTer, as well as the assessment of how far they have to go. The cores can vary in quality, accuracy, and state of completion, but a lot of them are still under active development and huge strides have been made in the past couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ4USj"&gt;Analogue lead hardware engineer Kevin Horton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 about the work that went into re-creating the Sega Genesis for the Mega Sg console. The process took him nine months, including two-and-a-half months figuring out the CPU at the heart of the console. “I didn’t know Genesis very well, and knew literally nothing about the 68000 CPU at all!” he said. “This was my first foray into both things and probably slowed the process down since I had to learn it all as I went.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sTroR1MGl9dFZSILkGtxUG2OY2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360568/sbyford_210310_4461_0021.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ggnrj8XBUPgNqvyDqVE37eOKWI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360567/sbyford_210310_4461_0020.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rPZ678"&gt;Ultimately, Horton confirmed the accuracy of his work by directly connecting a 68000 to an FPGA and comparing their performance on a test that ran for a week straight. It demonstrates the lengths that FPGA enthusiasts go to in pursuit of the most accurate results possible, but what makes MiSTer special is that this is largely the work of hobbyists. No one’s paying anyone a salary to make incremental tweaks to the performance of the arcade version of &lt;em&gt;Bionic Commando&lt;/em&gt;, but that’s where Tejada has directed his passion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NGda1"&gt;MiSTer is an important project because it speaks to the concept of preservation in a way that all too often goes underserved by the technology industry. The project makes the argument that the way we run software is as big a part of our experience as its content. Yes, you can port or emulate or re-release software to run on modern hardware, but there’s always going to be a compromise in the underlying code that moves the pixels in front of your eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="O2S55v"&gt;Of course, that might sound like a pretty niche concern for anyone who’s satisfied with, say, the emulated software you can run in a browser at &lt;a href="https://archive.org/"&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt;. I’m often one of those people myself — emulation can be great, and it’s hard to beat the convenience. But the MiSTer project is an incredible effort all the same. I’ll never have a shred of the technical knowledge possessed by MiSTer developers, but I’m grateful for their effort. Once you build your own system, it’s hard not to feel invested in the work that goes into it; MiSTer is a never-ending pursuit of perfection, and there’s something beautiful about that.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="xfzy9c"&gt;If you missed the restock for the $500 PS5 with a disc drive earlier this morning, Target has now restocked the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restocks03102021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt;, while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQCiLt"&gt;Looking at the product listing for the product, it appears Target is not shipping the item to your home address, but rather you have to choose in-store pickup. Once stores are out of stock, you likely will have to wait until the next stock drop to place an order.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Anyone living in Annapolis, MD looking for a PS5 Digital Edition? There’s a few in stock now&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sIz4uu"&gt;Once you have your PS5, you may want to consider buying some additional accessories not included with the console so you can get the most out of your new gadget; this includes an extra DualSense controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sMmMoI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQs3Og"&gt;There’s also a ton of PS5 games right now, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls Remake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Bluepoint Games or the third-party blockbuster titles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Yakuza-Like-Dragon-PlayStation-5/dp/B08VJNMWR8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Assassins-Valhalla-PlayStation-Standard-upgrade-4/dp/B08FS5HKTR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1734526510000262717" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cFEYoZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;I also recommend buying &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a one-year membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;, as the perks of having a subscription are great for PS5 users. Most notably, it nets you access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, an exclusive perk for PS5 owners that provides access to “generation-defining” titles that were released originally on PS4, including &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted IV: A Thief’s End. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dashlane is giving its one-click password changer a big upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBdn-g07uhu14BYhjBxr67bYI4w=/282x0:1638x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947682/Password_Changer.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dashlane&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A75AKx"&gt;Password manager Dashlane is introducing a rebuilt version of its its one-click password changer in beta, the company announced today. With the click of a button, Dashlane’s password changer can update your passwords on supported sites without requiring you to visit the site and change your credentials yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFOcsv"&gt;This GIF shows how it works: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypTKXsy6WyZjjhLf9yTK867nElA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22355351/Password_Changer___web_app.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nVIhud"&gt;The new version of the password changer works on-device, which should mean that websites are less likely to flag the attempt to change the password as unauthorized. And if the new password changer runs into something like an entry form for a two-factor authentication code, it can tell a user that they’ll have to do that step manually so that Dashlane can take care of the rest, like you can see in the GIF below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pB3L2zh222Wl260zfZMhUCwD024=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360805/Password_Changer___mobile.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Aluv0t"&gt;There’s one big caveat, though: the new password changer doesn’t work with every website just yet. Dashlane’s goal for the beta&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is that every customer will be able to change at least two passwords in their vault with the tool to start, and the company says it works with approximately 100 sites right now, “including popular social media, streaming, shopping, and news sites.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gzJrw"&gt;Dashlane first introduced a one-click password changer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/9/7357251/dashlane-can-now-change-all-your-passwords-with-a-single-click-and"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, but it started to work less reliably over time, Derek Snyder, Dashlane’s chief product officer, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The older version of the password changer is managed through Dashlane’s servers, which not only is a potential privacy risk but could also create issues with the actual password changing process. For example, a website might view Dashlane trying to change a user’s password as an unauthorized login since the change attempt was coming from a different place than where the user was located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01dwEl"&gt;One benefit of a one-click password changer is that, in theory, it’s easy to change a compromised login quickly. If Dashlane becomes aware of a breach in a service used by a significant number of users, the company’s goal is to have a new one-click password recipe ready “within a matter of hours,” Snyder said. That way, people can ideally act on a password breach notification swiftly with just a few clicks. (Dashlane maintains a database of compromised websites that you can &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2Fproduct%2Fbreach-center&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22320467%2Fdashlane-one-click-password-changer-autofill-machine-learning" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYFycV"&gt;And if a website changes the password flow in some way that breaks Dashlane’s one-click tool, the company’s engineers can remove the “recipe” for the password change from Dashlane so they can fix it, Snyder said. If you need to change your password in the interim, you’ll have to change it the old-fashioned way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KnQ0BF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dashlane is also launching an autofill engine powered by machine learning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rviKiO"&gt;Dashlane is also introducing a new autofill engine in beta that’s powered by machine learning. The idea is that Dashlane’s machine learning algorithms can learn how to recognize fields to fill in and more quickly and accurately fill in the content from your Dashlane vault onto the page. Dashlane says the new engine should work across all sites once it has rolled out to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XflnBR"&gt;Both features will be available to users in Dashlane’s beta program, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2Fbeta&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22320467%2Fdashlane-one-click-password-changer-autofill-machine-learning" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which you can sign up for here&lt;/a&gt;. The password changer will be available to any user in the beta today, and the company will be rolling it out to non-beta users over time. The new autofill engine will be available to beta users in about a week and over time to more users.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns7aOk"&gt;Users on both Dashlane’s paid tier and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dashlane.com%2Fplans%2Ffree&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22320467%2Fdashlane-one-click-password-changer-autofill-machine-learning" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free tier&lt;/a&gt;, which only works with one device and only lets you save credentials for up to 50 accounts, will be able to use the new autofill engine “always and forever,” according to Snyder. The new one-click password changer will be available to both paid and free Dashlane users during the beta, but the company still hasn’t decided whether it will be a paid-only option when it’s widely available, Snyder said. Both features are set to be out of beta later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CsrqLk"&gt;Dashlane’s changes arrive just days before popular password manager LastPass will restrict its free users to accessing their passwords on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;only one category of device&lt;/a&gt;, either mobile or computer. If you’re looking for an alternative, perhaps the convenience of Dashlane’s updated one-click password changer and its new autofill engine could make it the choice for you. And if you want to check out other free alternatives to LastPass and Dashlane, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"&gt;check out our guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon quietly opens its eleventh Fresh store, reportedly plans 28 more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z4xP_yJ7vqucmvKLEZXvP5itwvk=/0x1:8510x5674/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947626/DashLane.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Fresh stores feature its high-tech Dash shopping carts.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9hcMp"&gt;Last Thursday, Amazon opened its 11th Amazon Fresh grocery store, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-11/amazon-quietly-began-building-a-grocery-chain-during-pandemic?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a remarkably quick expansion of the initiative considering Amazon only opened its first store of this type on an invite-only basis in August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. The company doesn’t appear to be slowing down anytime soon either, with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reporting that it has plans for at least 28 more locations (though Amazon was only willing to confirm five of these).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWB1fc"&gt;Amazon’s Fresh stores are just one part of the company’s growing collection of retail stores. They’re meant to be less upscale than Amazon’s Whole Foods locations, and bigger than the company’s Go and Go Grocery locations. In the US, they also don’t use Amazon’s cashierless “Just Walk Out” technology, although the company says it’s testing it with a Fresh store in Illinois. The Fresh stores still feature high-tech elements like its touchscreen-equipped Dash shopping carts, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNAPQ1"&gt;Despite the rapid expansion, Amazon’s plans still trail traditional retailers. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Aldi has plans to open 100 more stores in the US this year, on top of the &lt;a href="https://corporate.aldi.us/en/aldi-history/#:~:text=Headquartered%20in%20Batavia%2C%20Illinois%2C%20ALDI,store%20in%20Iowa%20in%201976."&gt;more than 2,000 stores&lt;/a&gt; it already has in the USA. Walmart has &lt;a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/our-story/locations/united-states"&gt;over 5,000 stores and clubs&lt;/a&gt;, and even Amazon’s own Whole Foods has approximately 500 locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5n3fC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd5538"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP9PQ9ME_gfB9dweKHvjtlEq0RE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947568/DSCF7577.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="26hpQt"&gt;After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It’s also an important device for Oppo, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;recently overtook Huawei&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival’s troubles this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNJdHd"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone’s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of &lt;em&gt;Terminator 2-&lt;/em&gt;style liquid metal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/li_PZuoMOeFQdhkYRQU8RIWZ1lY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362260/DSCF7572.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H8Sbic"&gt;The camera system itself is no less unusual. There’s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we’ll have to see how that bears out in practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqWHj8"&gt;There’s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn’t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it’s more like a microscope than a macro lens — you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there’s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I’m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it’s pretty cool. Here’s a quick shot of my computer monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BZdLCMaTM4xe51OWFwIKTXjA2t4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362255/IMG20210311143520_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ibrXP2"&gt;You’ll notice that the whole shot isn’t quite in focus, and that’s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close — you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQIVVq"&gt;One notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it’s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That’s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won’t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z2ZGfAfwu3JOBgQC-Q2ad5yxCmM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22362261/DSCF7578.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tWxaBM"&gt;The Find X3 Pro’s display is another key feature; it’s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it’s a 10-bit panel and that it’s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKe3mQ"&gt;The Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo’s off to a good start here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbpxC7"&gt;We don’t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome for Android can now preview a page before opening a link  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ixAW3KHw6_GkbTqNRbP30o1bCyU=/423x0:4983x3040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68947421/Screenshot_20210311_101409.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Preview page” now appears an an option when you long-press a link.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KTqJnD"&gt;Chrome’s Android app now lets you preview a webpage before committing to clicking on a link, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/10/chrome-android-preview-page/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature appears to have been enabled via a server-side update to version 89 of the browser, and can be accessed by long-pressing on a link and then tapping “Preview page.” It seems to be Android-only for the time being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLpx4W"&gt;It’s a small, but helpful, feature if you want to quickly check the contents of a webpage without fully leaving your current page. Maybe that’s to get the gist of an article by reading its first couple of paragraphs, or because you’re still vigilant about being Rick-rolled in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O1aTxo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A small but helpful addition&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Akut7K"&gt;The feature has been included in other browsers for a little while now. On iOS, both Safari and Edge already default to previewing a webpage when you long-press a link, and by default neither require the additional step of selecting “Preview page” from a menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhxMS2"&gt;Chrome’s support for link previews on Android has been in the works for a little while, and was spotted while it was in development way back in December 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-sneak-peak-page-loading/#:~:text=To%20enable%20this%20feature%2C%20you,link%20you%20want%20to%20preview."&gt;by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, however, it appears to be available to everyone without having to be manually enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
