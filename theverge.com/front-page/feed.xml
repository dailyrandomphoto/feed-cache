    <title>A comedian says he created ‘Darla,’ the anti-union Amazon worker, as a joke</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TkzeF0"&gt;While some Alabama Amazon workers were submitting their votes to unionize the company’s first US warehouse last week, something strange was happening on Twitter. Accounts seemingly belonging to warehouse workers were tweeting at users supporting the union or making unsavory comments about Amazon in general. Amazon’s anti-union Twitter army has been a subject of criticism and mockery for the last few years, inspiring a slew of accounts parodying actual Amazon ambassadors, but the Bessemer fight brought it all back into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzYxt5"&gt;Over the weekend, one parody account, in particular, caught the attention of reporters and Amazon detractors across Twitter: @AmazonFCDarla. Darla’s profile picture looked fake, but the language used in her tweets was eerily similar to that used by real Amazon employees. Publications like &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/theres-something-fishy-about-amazons-anti-union-twitter-1846572212"&gt;quickly debunked Darla’s&lt;/a&gt; account. Her profile picture appeared to have been created by an artificial intelligence program like &lt;a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/"&gt;This Person Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;. Her account was created in March with no tweets dating back to the beginning of Amazon’s ambassador program. And Darla’s tweets were half-baked “in the way that a troll might tweet,” &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq3BQ0"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of the accounts weren’t created by company employees.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Many of these are not Amazon FC Ambassadors – it appears they are fake accounts that violate Twitter’s terms,” a spokesperson said. “We’ve asked Twitter to investigate and take appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcfdB4"&gt;It didn’t take long for Twitter to suspend the Darla account and other fake ones on the grounds of “impersonation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hoJpV9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's official, Darla is dead for good. RIP, and best wishes to her boys, Tyler and Cameron &lt;a href="https://t.co/522kxhQBzI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/522kxhQBzI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— hi i'm robby (@robbleton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1377115245265580037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HRsLM1"&gt;Robby Appleton, a comedian from Chicago, came forward on Tuesday saying he had created the Darla account to parody real Amazon Twitter ambassadors. “On Friday, I created a satirical Twitter account making fun of Amazon’s anti-union propaganda,” Appleton said in a tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1376603576731111429?s=20"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. “I can’t wrap my head around how far this dumb Twitter account got,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1376683571763687429?s=20"&gt;said in another&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhuKQ"&gt;Appleton provided a variety of evidence to back up the claim, including two email responses from Twitter regarding an account suspension he claims to be Darla’s. The first email shows Twitter’s response to his appeal for the account to be reinstated. Appleton also forwarded an email from Twitter confirming that an account belonging to his email was “permanently” suspended for violating the platform’s rules on “impersonation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHUSfN"&gt;Twitter declined to confirm or deny that Appleton was the user behind the @AmazonFCDarla account on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHoReU"&gt;I spoke with Appleton on Tuesday night about why he started the account and what he would tell Amazon if the company is still paying attention to the gag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxuoiW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Sj4Z8g"&gt;
&lt;p id="0DOZTV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to make the account in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kODMj3"&gt;It was Friday afternoon when I first made the account, and I’d been watching all the news with the Amazon plant in Alabama trying to unionize. I was watching all of the really weird responses from the Amazon News account to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and I was like, “That’s a really insane PR strategy they seem to have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deXQWa"&gt;Then I started spotting these Amazon FC accounts, and I knew there were a lot of parodies, but a couple of them seemed legitimate. They had very little engagement, like three or four followers. They would reply to something and mostly just get hate. It was so bizarre to me that Amazon was making their employees sit on the clock and be sycophants for the people hiring them. Also, their strategy was so chaotic that this wasn’t even effective. And I thought, because it was so chaotic, I might be able to make an account and maybe fool a dozen people into thinking it was real and have a little fun with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdJwC0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time did you dedicate to the account? And what was your strategy for drafting the tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VgAf2"&gt;It was actually pretty minimal. I know a lot of Twitter detectives kept going after the profile picture. It was AI-generated from This Person Does Not Exist. And the reason for that was just like, I was just lazy. If I thought this was going to fool a lot of people, I probably would have gotten a friend or a family member to pose for a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRRNaH"&gt;I spent the whole weekend at my girlfriend’s parents’ house for Passover. I didn’t have a lot of free time because we were cooking, eating, and we were going shopping because I got some new cats. Most of this happened in little moments I could steal away on my phone. But the strategy was just that I wanted to see how far I could push one of these accounts without making it so absurd no one would believe me. I learned to keep it just realistic enough that I thought I could fool most people while keeping it strongly satirical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTGmSs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long were you planning to keep pushing this schtick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZZ1e2"&gt;Honestly, I had no real strategy. Once the account had been suspended, it was clear that I wasn’t going to have any more fun with this. Yesterday, I knew the end was near, and so I decided that today, I was going to post a fake PowerPoint presentation for Amazon that started as an anti-union speech and turned into this really strongly pro-union “seize the means of production” rant. But Twitter suspended me a bit before I could do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emxtQ1"&gt;I was maybe going to put the Soviet national anthem under it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvyDDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was reported that Amazon asked Twitter to investigate the account. If Amazon is still paying attention, what would you tell the company now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEg1pw"&gt;If their working conditions are as good as they claimed, they should welcome a union because it would be the pride of every union. If they’re so good that they don’t need a union, the union would come in and absolutely praise for the good work they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I1IaY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s iPhone 12 stand will follow you with face tracking (but not during video calls)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_MyDRTOtdl9YM1IeiLdi0MLnHE=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054852/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_playing_guitar_on_live_stream_carousel_1_v01_r01_1680x800_us.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgwcJV"&gt;Belkin has a new iPhone stand that’s useful enough to be interesting but annoyingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSHDJV"&gt;The company’s “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magnetic Phone Mount with Face Tracking&lt;/a&gt;” works with the iPhone 12’s MagSafe feature, clipping your phone into place using the device’s built-in magnets. It then uses face tracking to follow you around the room, rotating so it’s always facing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwSRbw"&gt;The catch is that this feature doesn’t work with video calls on Zoom, FaceTime, or any other similar service — surely one of the biggest potential use cases in a pandemic. In fact, judging by the product description, the tracking feature &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works when recording video through Belkin’s own iOS app. That would mean you can’t even use the stand to make sure your phone is always facing you as you follow along with an exercise video or recipe. We’ve reached out to Belkin to double check this and will update this article when we know more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9itFST-kcwCd0tftdHB2JqBUJ9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410698/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_hosting_streaming_workout_session_carousel_2_v01_r01_1680x800_us.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can track yourself recording video but not watching it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ij6qo"&gt;Being able to record video that tracks you will definitely be useful to some people, and Belkin says its iOS app can connect directly to social media accounts (including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others) to make posting easy. But it still means the mount is more of a specialist tool than a device that could help more consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRDLhq"&gt;Other relevant specs: the mount works in landscape and portrait orientations, can be tilted vertically from -15 to 30 degrees, rotates horizontally through 360 degrees, and is powered by three AA batteries. And of course, because it uses MagSafe to attach to your phone, it only works with the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The mount will sell for $65, but it’s only listed as “coming soon” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Belkin’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Lite is shutting down at the end of April</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdtYxl2kIH9ZyPs5nyt0pqq3aV4=/113x0:1859x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054775/pubg_mobile.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Ah5rA"&gt;There are a few different versions of &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt; — the game that popularized the battle royale genre and inspired a legion of competitors — which you can play on everything from your underpowered phone to your high-end gaming rig. At the end of April, however, the list will be one entry shorter: &lt;em&gt;PUBG Lite&lt;/em&gt;, the free-to-play version of the ultimate life and death fight specced for lower-end machines, is &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2021/03/30/notice-april-29-service-termination-notice/"&gt;going dark on April 29th&lt;/a&gt;. New downloads were shut down on March 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuMgnp"&gt;In its note to fans, Krafton, the game’s publisher, didn’t give a reason for the impending closure. Here’s what it &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2021/03/30/notice-april-29-service-termination-notice/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in full: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MAywm1"&gt;We are deeply grateful for the passion and support from the astounding number of PUBG LITE fans that have been with us. During the strenuous times of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that PUBG LITE was able to provide our fans a fun way to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhcG9n"&gt;Unfortunately, we have made the difficult decision to close service after much deliberation and the time has come for our journey to end. We regretfully inform you that service of PUBG LITE is scheduled to end on April 29th, 2021 (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NDAiii"&gt;News of the shutdown came after the publisher’s announcement last November that &lt;em&gt;PUBG Lite&lt;/em&gt; was going fully free-to-play, after &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2020/11/13/2020-november-dev-letter-l-coin-system-termination/"&gt;ditching its in-game currency system&lt;/a&gt;. The game was launched in beta in January 2019 in Thailand, and it moved to Europe in October of that same year. Goodnight, sweet prince. Goodnight, sweet ultimate life and death fight. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 review: Ring’s best doorbell yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new top-of-the-line Ring doorbell is expensive but works well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ZaO1pl"&gt;Ring’s new $249.99 Video Doorbell Pro 2 is the best video doorbell yet from a company that has nearly become a household name for video doorbells. It has an excellent field of view and video quality; plenty of customizable features for notifications and recording zones; and speedy performance, whether that’s sending alerts to your phone or smart speaker when someone rings the bell or pulling up the live feed from the Ring app on a phone. If you can tolerate the price tag, are able to install a wired doorbell at your door, and aren’t put off by Ring’s Neighbors app or police partnerships (both of which you can opt out of), the Video Doorbell Pro 2 is one of the best video doorbells you can get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDRHOb"&gt;The new Video Doorbell Pro 2 is Ring’s top-of-the-line model, replacing the original Video Doorbell Pro from 2017. Unlike Ring’s other doorbells, the Pro 2 does not have a battery option; you have to have wiring running to it for power. But because it doesn’t have to house a battery, the Pro 2 is much smaller than Ring’s battery-powered options and has faster response times when you want to pull up the feed on your phone or an Echo Show smart display. It also can work with an existing doorbell chime in your home if you have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5wxhI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421741"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9mDFz"&gt;Despite its higher-than-average price tag, the Pro 2 doesn’t really look all that much more premium than other Ring models. The housing is made entirely of plastic, and there’s a big Ring logo stamped on the bottom. If sleek design is what you’re after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22318478/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-review-test-price"&gt;Logitech Circle View Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; are better choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzGXbN"&gt;Ring has added a number of new features this time around, but the most significant change is how the Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures video clips. Unlike the prior model and every other Ring doorbell before it, the Pro 2 shoots 1536 x 1536-pixel square video, which lets you see visitors from top to bottom. It also makes it much easier to see if packages have been left at your doorstep because you can see the ground right in front of the doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM8q9t"&gt;On my doorway, the Pro 2’s wide and tall field of view was able to let me see the entirety of my small porch much better than the older 16:9 format Ring doorbells or others that have a tall but not as wide aspect ratio, like Logitech’s Circle View Doorbell. The Pro 2 captures a sharp and detailed image, complete with HDR for balancing bright skies and visitors’ faces. It also has a dedicated infrared night mode that will come on automatically if the light levels are low enough. The porch light I have at my doorway was sufficient enough to keep the Pro 2 in normal video mode, so I was able to have full-color video captures at night without blinding visitors with a light on the doorbell itself like what happens with the Circle View Doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fn6WnL93QgNcXYX-fc16XIPTPHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406592/dseifert_20210323_4486_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 has a new camera that captures a wide and tall square video clip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nMAQwL1KZ7saW93S9volPrtUtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406590/dseifert_20210323_4486_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite its higher-than-average price tag, the Video Doorbell Pro 2 is still very plasticky and looks cheap compared to other options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYDc41"&gt;Thanks to support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, pulling up the Pro 2’s video feed through the Ring app on my phone is a painless process that just takes a couple of seconds. Likewise, asking an Echo Show to display the feed is quick and easy. The Echo Show and Fire TV devices will even automatically display the feed from the camera whenever the doorbell is rung. Older video doorbells used to take an agonizing amount of time to show their video feeds. I’m glad to see this newest crop is much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoa4c9"&gt;The Pro 2 also has a new “3D Motion Detection” feature that lets you see the movements of someone on your property even if they are out of frame of the camera. The name oversells what this is doing a bit: the app will show a top-down view of movements represented as colored dots on the map of your home overlaid over the recorded video clip. It’s designed to let you see where someone has been on your property before they show up on the primary camera. But the range for this feature is limited to only 30 feet — that’s about enough to reach a third of the way down my driveway — and while it’s a neat demo of technology, I didn’t find much utility in it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dOS2ftO1vLT3Ui_-xQefBSfAFpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410391/daytime_2up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 shows more of my front porch than other doorbells. The new 3D Motion Detection feature provides the bird’s-eye view of movement on my property, seen in the right image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTuda"&gt;The other thing I didn’t find much use for is the Alexa Greetings feature, which lets you have Alexa answer the door through the Ring doorbell if you don’t get to it within a set amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2z4Yz"&gt;There are two reasons I didn’t really like this feature. One is since we’re still spending the majority of our time home due to the pandemic, I don’t really need someone else to answer the door for me — I’m always there. The other is the idea of having Amazon’s Alexa robot speak to a visitor in my place. Alexa can ask couriers to leave a package in a particular place you specify or record a message from other visitors that will be sent to your phone. In my tests, it works like a typical Alexa interaction, with a slight delay between each prompt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmk1Ok"&gt;But in general, it feels a bit off-putting and rude to force visitors to interact with an unexpected robot. I feel the same way about using the two-way audio to talk to someone at the door through my phone. While there may certainly be great accessibility use cases for these features, they weren’t helpful for me, and I left them turned off. I think basic package detection and notifications, which other doorbells offer, would be more useful, but Ring doesn’t have any features like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW7aox"&gt;The Alexa responses feature requires a subscription to Ring’s Protect plan, which starts at $3 per month and enables other features such as a six-second pre-roll recording for motion alerts, the option to only get alerted when a person is detected, video history for up to 60 days, and the ability to save and share clips. You can use the Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 without paying for this subscription, but you’ll be limited to motion alerts, live view, two-way talking, and six preset responses if you’re not home. Neither one of Ring’s plans, paid or free, offers continuous 24/7 recording. If that’s something you want, Google’s Nest Hello is a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fDqBQCrK7_eH9qhwaRMvy2hbRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410429/nightime_2up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 has a traditional grayscale infrared night mode (right), but if you have enough light, it will fall back to its color feed at night (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYdSOu"&gt;Since Ring is an Amazon company, the Pro 2 works best and offers the most utility if you have Amazon Echo speakers or smart displays. In addition to the ability to automatically show the feed when the bell is pressed, you can have Echo speakers announce when someone’s at the door so you never miss a visitor. This feature isn’t available with Google Nest smart speakers or displays; again, the Nest Hello would be a better choice if you’re running a Google smart home. (Likewise, if you’re running an Apple HomeKit smart home, the Logitech Circle View Doorbell is a better choice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmO74r"&gt;Lastly, I can’t cover a Ring product without mentioning its controversial Neighbors app and police partnerships. The Neighbors app is a separate app that collates crime and safety reports from other Ring owners in your neighborhood. By default, the Neighbors feed is integrated into the Ring app, allowing you to see other posts and share video clips from your camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57RkP5"&gt;Similarly, the Public Safety feature allows police and other public service agencies to request video clips from your camera to aid in solving crimes. You then have the option to approve or deny the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="xwGmh2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10421784"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FaiaA"&gt;Ring has made it easier to manage these features. Both of them are controlled in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050426/ring-control-center-privacy-dashboard-app-police-security-two-factor-ces-2020"&gt;app’s Control Center section&lt;/a&gt;, where you can disable the Neighbors feed and block public agencies from requesting clips from your video camera. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;enable end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt;, which will disable these features and limit the ability to share video clips with others. But I wish Ring would go even further and disable both of them by default, letting owners decide if they want to opt in or not during setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlbTl2"&gt;Ring’s portfolio of video doorbells has grown significantly over the past couple of years, and it can be confusing to figure out which one is right for your needs. The Pro 2’s pitch is simple: this is the best video doorbell camera Ring sells, provided you have the ability to hook it up to existing doorbell wiring or run new wiring to it. If you want the best performance and are in Amazon’s Echo ecosystem, the Pro 2 is the doorbell to get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Specialized Como SL e-bike review: mellow yellow</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A fun lightweight commuter from the maker of the Turbo Vado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cCW5rF"&gt;Specialized just released one of its most interesting electric bikes to date, the Como SL. The SL stands for “Super Light,” and Specialized is marketing it as an everyday commuter, perfect for zipping over to a friend’s house, picking up some groceries, or, if you really need to, carrying up a few flights of stairs. There’s even a hand grip built into the frame to help lift the bike when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JzBX"&gt;The Como SL is a slimmed-down version of Specialized’s Turbo Como, which is the company’s entry-level electric bike for commuters. The company is doubling down on a lot of the elements that made the Turbo Como so inviting to riders, while also adding a whole host of additional features — including aluminum fenders, a rear rack, and a front-mounted basket — without adding unnecessary pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlDKFz"&gt;For the last week and a half, I’ve had the pleasure of riding the Como SL all over my neighborhood to see how it measures up — not only to Specialized’s other highly capable, extremely powerful (and at times very pricy) e-bikes, but also to the other lightweight commuter e-bikes that have been flooding the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AS5sna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421956"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gFmo6e"&gt;I tackled steep hills, busy county roads without bike lanes, and even a languid ride through the park. While the Como SL is not the most powerful e-bike I’ve ever ridden, it is among the smoothest and easiest to handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLhUwx"&gt;Maybe it was the warming spring weather or the way the Como SL’s yellow paint job reflected the daffodils just now emerging from the ground, but I found this bike to be an absolute delight to ride. I did have some issues with the UX of the digital display, and the gearing left a little bit to be desired. But overall, the skill and craftsmanship Specialized put into the Como SL really shone through, and I think this will be a worthy addition to the company’s growing lineup of e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8ClsxKpsNx6e9i_24smEUOZd3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408145/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL has a surprising amount of cargo capacity for errands or other outings. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gBfy"&gt;Specialized may be based in California, but its design team is headquartered in a nondescript brick building in Cham, Switzerland. That’s where the company designs its Turbo-branded e-bikes like the Levo, Creo, Vado, and Como, as well as their Super Light variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlBMpq"&gt;To make the Como SL worthy of that suffix, the company started out by fully integrating the battery into the frame of the bike. Many direct-to-consumer e-bike brands have unsightly batteries perched on the downtube, while other companies have tried to have it both ways by integrating it into the frame while also having it be removable. Specialized decided to make its battery both fully integrated and non-removable, placing the Como SL in the same category as companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484541/ampler-stout-e-bike-review-its-not-easy-being-green"&gt;Ampler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;Gogoro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Dlni"&gt;“By integrating [the battery] we were able to make a really lightweight aluminum frame,” Dominik Geyer, head of business for Specialized’s Turbo brand, who is based in the company’s Swiss office, told me. “We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfkYvQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTrKNq"&gt;Specialized says the Como SL’s 320Wh battery should be good for 62 miles (100 kilometers) of range, depending on the terrain and power setting. I found that while riding in the middle “Sport” setting, I burned through nearly 100 percent of the battery in less than 35 miles. That’s pretty standard for an e-bike battery, but Specialized does offer an optional Range Extender for $449.99, which the company says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq44Qz"&gt;Specialized says the battery can recharge from 3 percent to 100 percent in approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes. There’s a port at the base of the downtube where you can plug in the 48V charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDCmWQ"&gt;Another driving factor was simplicity, Geyer said. Specialized wanted a bike that was easy to ride and even easier to maintain. The Gates carbon belt drive and internal geared hub motor speak to this desire, as well as the simplicity of the cockpit controls. “The bike simply needs to be a trusted partner in your daily life to get around,” Geyer added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YueJOM"&gt;Still, the Como SL isn’t exactly a featherweight. It essentially weighs the same as the Turbo Como — between 47 and 48.5 pounds, depending on the frame size — despite all those new accessories. That means Specialized has found other, unique ways to shave off some of that bulk without compromising on what makes it so much fun to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvAMUy"&gt;One of those is the SL motor, which tips the scale at 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). Compare that to the Turbo Como’s motor, which weighs about 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg), and you can see how much work Specialized put into shrinking down the componentry in this bike. The motor is developed jointly by Specialized and Brose, a German company that also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;e-bike motors for Harley-Davidson&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgW3Cl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61fDnG"&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right, to some extent. Specialized says the Como SL’s rear-hub motor has 240W of peak and continuous power as well as 35Nm of torque. That’s slightly less than the Turbo Como, which has a mid-drive motor rated for 250W of nominal power and 415W of peak and 50Nm of torque. Specialized says the Turbo Como offers riders four times their natural power input while pedaling, while the Como SL only delivers twice as much power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjfrec"&gt;That becomes readily apparent when powering up a steep hill. I found myself having to exert a lot more force than I usually do when riding an e-bike, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate an e-bike that makes you work a little bit harder to get you to where you’re going, though I realize I might be in the minority with that opinion, especially if your goal is to arrive at your office job sweat-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoLXOB"&gt;Overall, the look of the bike is very clean and polished, with all the wires integrated into the bike’s frame. That’s a stark contrast to most DTC e-bikes, which typically come with a rat’s nest of wires tangled around the handlebars. After all, there are clear advantages to going with an e-bike from a legacy bike company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJG9WixZVCDcpJs6bZaqUMC4o2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408079/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The on/off button on the downtube also displays battery levels. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ih_oVku91IpcqPqxlvBAxGnrWcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408147/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Gates carbon belt drive is cleaner and easier to maintain than a traditional chainring. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p8mGQjJ0QS_Dqv237E8YmTDpAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408146/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Front and back lights are connected to the bike’s battery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYjVfaMFfE1q1kDvYGHoIIcik88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408078/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The display has left and right buttons to toggle between different screens. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4JYT"&gt;Let’s talk about the digital display because this was my least favorite part about the Como SL. The LCD display is small by e-bike standards, 2.5 x 2 inches, or about the size of a pack of gum. There are only two buttons, left and right, which can be used to scroll through a half-dozen different screens showing speed, odometer, calories burned, distance traveled, and a timer. It’s a clean design, but I found it to be over-simplified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAxwoZ"&gt;The real controls are routed through Specialized’s smartphone app, Mission Control, which is paired with the bike via Bluetooth. I’ll be completely honest: I am not a fan of app-based controls for e-bikes. It was one of my few beefs with Gogoro’s Eeyo 1S, and the same goes for the Como SL. I understand that by offloading certain controls to an app, manufacturers can offer nicer graphics and more functionality while saving on the costs associated with the on-bike display. And you don’t need the app to actually turn the bike on; the button for that is placed on a nice rubber pad in the downtube, along with a series of blue light bars that indicate battery strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIZTw"&gt;But when I’m riding an e-bike, I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone. The Como SL doesn’t come with a standard phone mount. Although one could certainly be purchased separately, I’d struggle to find a place to mount it. The sloping handlebars would likely direct the phone’s display off to the side. And the LCD screen is mounted in the center, which would be another obvious place for a mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ5xed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYAsBj"&gt;The good part about the app is the level of fine-tuning it allows. You can customize the power settings to fit your riding style. The “Smart Control” feature automatically tailors the electronic assist in real time based on the information you input, such as how far you plan on riding. That worked well when I took the Como SL on a 10-mile ride with a lot of steep hills. The gearing on this bike is also among the most seamless I’ve ever experienced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kUABm"&gt;My last issue with the Como SL is the price. Specialized’s build quality is among the best in the industry, so you won’t be surprised to learn that this bike is a little expensive. There are two versions of the Como SL: the 4.0, which retails for $3,299.99, and the 5.0, which sells for $3,699.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnAmZy"&gt;The difference between the two is the number of gears in the Shimano drivetrain. The Como SL 4.0 features the 5-speed Nexus system, while the 5.0 comes with the 8-speed Alfine. There are also different paint jobs that come with both. The 4.0 comes in three colors: “cast umber,” “dove grey,” and “raspberry.” The 5.0, which is the one I tested, comes in “brassy yellow,” “brushed silver,” and “smoke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dc8joiTT970ppQwPQeZdNRTJI6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408082/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL is very approachable, with a low-step frame that makes mounting and dismounting a breeze. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kg2YLB"&gt;Specialized claims both bikes can reach a top speed of 28mph — which technically puts them in the speed pedelec category. However, on a flat surface and in the highest “Turbo” power setting, I was only able to get up to 24–25 mph. Not a huge deal, but it still left me wondering what I was missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQdjvP"&gt;Overall, the Como SL is a super fun, super lightweight, very approachable electric bike. The shape and contours of the frame are inviting, the front basket and rear rack allow for a decent amount of storage, and the drivetrain is extremely simple to use. Although I would have preferred less reliance on the app for basic functionality, I’m also not a Luddite, and I realize this is a direction some e-bikes appear to be heading. Fortunately, it’s not ubiquitous, so there’s still time to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BC1VRV"&gt;The price may deter those looking for something inexpensive. But for fans of Specialized — or for anyone who’s interested in an e-bike from a trusted company with decades of experience in the building, selling, and maintenance of bikes, both traditional and electric, — the Como SL should be the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DC2jOd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;coming on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;, but if you have been keeping up with the news surrounding the game, you may have heard about Lady Dimitrescu, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tall woman who has become &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/15/22233028/resident-evil-village-capcom-preview-fans-love-big-vampire-lady"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular on the internet&lt;/a&gt;. There have been a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daniellednicola/status/1354231556265680898?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1354231556265680898%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cosplaycentral.com%2Ftopics%2Fcosplay%2Fnews%2Fthis-lady-dimitrescu-cosplay-from-resident-evil-village-is-stunning"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hellyvalentine_/status/1365330999731752963?s=20"&gt;cosplayers&lt;/a&gt; who’ve attempted to re-create the iconic villain, but the most recent cosplay from Yekaterina Lisina is arguably the best yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1mdc3"&gt;Lisina, a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/worlds-tallest-model-no-one-cares-about-my-basketball-career/"&gt;former Olympian-turned-model&lt;/a&gt;, recently shared some content on Instagram of her cosplaying Lady Dimitrescu, even going so far as to re-create a parody of one of the trailers for the game. But don’t take my word for it, just check out the video she shared on her Instagram page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fjIPS5"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0CoPYi"&gt;Lisina stands at 6 feet, 9 inches tall — which, fun fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;is the inverse height of the actual character&lt;/a&gt;, according to the game’s art director. This isn’t the only content we’ve seen from Lisina cosplaying as the character: she also posted a TikTok a few days ago of her in the outfit. Outside of cosplaying as the latest &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;antagonist, Lisina also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLJHO3kBxRQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;cosplayed as Princess Peach&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CfQSj"&gt;And now, I shall patiently wait to see if someone on the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; development team notices Lisina’s cosplay because I really want to know what their reaction is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Original Xbox and Xbox 360 games arrive on Microsoft’s xCloud streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2oAFdjKAjR5sKdZsXeTKr1B3xM=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054377/xcloudxbox360games.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfmC2P"&gt;Microsoft is bringing 16 original Xbox and Xbox 360 games to the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service today. Titles like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;, the original &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt; are all now available to stream to Android devices. Microsoft is also enabling touch controls for &lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata TIP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTNyKM"&gt;The 16 games will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members and streamable to Android phones and tablets. “We’ve listened to the feedback, going all the way back to our earliest cloud gaming preview, and making games from previous generations available on mobile devices has been one of the most requested features by the community,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/31/backward-compatibility-reaches-the-clouds-for-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-members/"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9g0FY"&gt;Microsoft is also still planning to extend xCloud game streaming to iOS this spring. The software maker hasn’t revealed exactly when its iOS preview will go live, but Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;previously promised&lt;/a&gt; both iOS and web browser streaming for xCloud in spring 2021. Game streaming will be available in the Xbox app for Windows 10 PCs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly0zwB"&gt;We got an early look at how xCloud will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304762/microsoft-xcloud-app-windows-xbox-touch-controls-gyro-support"&gt;work on Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; last month, alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;exclusive first look at the web version of the service&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also testing 1080p streams for xCloud, and this will likely debut with the Windows version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o50xjZ"&gt;For now, here are the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games making their way to Xbox Cloud Gaming today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YJmXGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJ1XcD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Tooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uEZV1t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double Dragon Neon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pGYcfK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yig9FW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="50YGsT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OmnC4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MZpXQZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War: Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G0lEwQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled (touch controls enabled)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bKx9XS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kameo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nmwDhR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qiOcTW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11iKnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8VmEvm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRMHvL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AH7JwK"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata: TIP&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Zola’s first trailer is as over-the-top as the Twitter thread it’s based on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zola screenshot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anM-2vyUPq-yyv3uibSvhTtdQBI=/86x0:1015x619/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054165/200590_1_1100.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Anna Kooris / Sundance Institute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ThvXQI"&gt;Social media has produced plenty of stories that have a ring of truth but are packed with ridiculous twists that seem way too good to be true. Thus it was with #TheStory, a &lt;a href="https://shadowandact.com/heres-a-recap-of-the-epic-zola-twitter-tale-and-the-actors-who-could-star-in-the-upcoming-movie-adaptation"&gt;148-part Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; by Aziah “Zola” Wells King — except her thread turned out to be a &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; true recounting of two women on a nightmare Florida road trip. Last year at the Sundance Film Festival, director Janicza Bravo turned that thread into a film that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21082396/zola-thestory-viral-twitter-thread-film-review-sundance-2020"&gt;dramatizes the story&lt;/a&gt; without losing Zola’s sardonic charm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTxoff"&gt;A24 is now releasing &lt;em&gt;Zola&lt;/em&gt; in theaters this summer, and the first trailer was released online today. It’s a pretty good encapsulation of the movie, starring Taylour Paige as the semi-fictionalized A’Ziah King and Riley Keough as her volatile frenemy Stefani, who drags Zola into a trafficking underworld after inviting her on a spontaneous strip club tour. Also, don’t miss &lt;em&gt;Succession’s&lt;/em&gt; Nicholas Braun — who plays Stefani’s hapless boyfriend — bragging about “schmoney.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shorted video creators thousands of dollars in ad revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A dollar sign broken into small pieces revealing the Facebook logo at the center." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQCRelR4F1g62EUe_Zc6dx62ZL4=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054147/VRG_ILLO_4497_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Due to a ‘technical issue’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="obIJM4"&gt;Britain Lockhart never knows what he’ll find when he scuba dives for treasure. Neither do his viewers on Facebook who tune in for a surprise reveal. His page, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/Depthsofhistory"&gt;Depths of History&lt;/a&gt;, has been steadily growing on the social network since he started posting videos there about two years ago. He now has 70,000 followers on his page, which has started generating thousands of dollars a month in ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn2bRx"&gt;“I really didn’t think it would be that profitable at all, but Facebook has such a variety of users on their interface that don’t even use YouTube, but they’ll be on Facebook,” he says, adding that he’ll post his YouTube videos on Facebook to make ad revenue on both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZmKPe"&gt;His income varies, although he says he’ll typically make between $2,000 and $3,000 per month through Facebook. But in 2021 so far, that income has unexpectedly dried up. The January payout was only $931, leaving him thousands of dollars short. In February, it was even lower, coming in at just $664. He double-checked his creator backend, and the numbers didn’t make sense there, either. Facebook’s revenue estimation tool projected that he should have received $3,397 for January and $1,747.52 for February. When the checks came in, he ended up more than $4,000 short&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVJvPk"&gt;“It was like a slap in the face,” Lockhart says. “I was looking forward to buying more camera gear to increase my business, buying things that could prolong me working with Facebook and me working with YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LqXHa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lockhart is owed thousands of dollars from two months of shorted payouts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kqQjcQ"&gt;And he’s not the only one who hasn’t been entirely paid out. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with two other Facebook video creators, all of whom say the company shorted them on cash and ignored their requests for help. The creators had no reason to initially question the amount they were paid since Facebook’s estimated revenue tool almost always mirrored their actual payouts. Usually, they’d be short only a couple hundred dollars. But after their revenue seemed off two months in a row, the creators say they looked into the issue. All three say the problems began in January, around the time Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/introducing-the-new-page-experience/"&gt;transitioned&lt;/a&gt; to its new Pages experience and made updates to how creators can monetize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHQKCX"&gt;The sudden change is particularly alarming because of Facebook’s ambiguous approach to revenue-sharing in general. The company’s core business has always been direct, targeted advertising, but Facebook now sees an opportunity in sharing revenue with video creators, along the lines of YouTube or Twitch. Facebook has courted all sorts of creators — gamers, writers, and video hosts — through broader monetization options, like in-stream ads, shopping, and even subscription newsletters. It’s still unclear how many creators are on Facebook, but the strategy seems to be somewhat working. Facebook says there are more than 1 million shops across its app and Instagram, and that from 2019 to 2020, the number of content creators on Facebook earning the equivalent of $10,000 USD per month grew 88 percent, and creators earning $1,000 per month grew 94 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2kgkn"&gt;But these creators say Facebook only cares about advertisers, leaving them with no one to turn to when their payments are unexpectedly short. They reached out for help, but the company gave them no feedback on what could be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uypqYn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The payout problems started when creators switched to the new Pages experience&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xdWFag"&gt;After &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reached out for comment, however, Facebook said it “resolved a technical issue that prevented a small number of video creators on Facebook from receiving their full in-stream ads payouts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsKYtL"&gt;“We’re notifying these partners that they’ll receive those remaining in-stream payments during the April payout cycle, and we apologize for any inconvenience,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTmM1e"&gt;It’s good news for the creators getting a rebate but still an alarming precedent — holding thousands of dollars back for months with little explanation or guarantee the same problem won’t pop up again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rWL1V"&gt;Volodymyr Popkov, the creator of the page &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/paintifyinspiration/"&gt;Painting Inspiration&lt;/a&gt;, which demos acrylic paint art tutorials, suggests that Facebook doesn’t value the creators who make the platform thrive. “They have live chat Facebook support for the people who spend money for the ads, who bring [Facebook] their money, but for people who are like us, the creators, they owe us money right now, and they’re not doing anything,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ggkdH"&gt;Facebook estimated that Popkov would get $13,000 in January, he says, but he only received $4,600. In February, he was estimated to receive $29,000 but made only $6,400. He knows the number is just an estimate, but he says he hasn’t seen any change in the numbers of viewers on his videos — at least not enough to explain a $32,000 shortfall. It’s a particular problem because Popkov employs artists to make artwork for the page. His Facebook income serves as payroll for them, along with his revenue from YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ekgBGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook confirmed that a “technical issue” is to blame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzItpm"&gt;Another creator, Erik Reed, of the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/OutdoorswithErik"&gt;Outdoors With Erik&lt;/a&gt; page, says he’s owed over $10,000, going off the estimate tools. He specifically joined Facebook because other creators told him the monetization options and engagement levels were worthwhile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKJcg"&gt;Facebook has a long history of shoddy metrics causing problems for partners. Earlier this month, court documents &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289232/facebook-ad-revenue-proposed-reach-inflation-lawsuit-unredacted-filings"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook provided advertisers with “inflated and misleading” metrics for years on how many people their ads were reaching. The company apparently knew that the reach of these ads was amplified by fake and duplicate accounts, but chose not to delete them. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time that this reach tool provided only “an estimate,” although Facebook allegedly knew advertisers based decisions around the metric. The company also previously faced a lawsuit that claimed it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989712/facebook-inaccurate-video-metrics-inflation-lawsuit"&gt;knowingly overestimated&lt;/a&gt; how much video content users watched. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-reaches-proposed-settlement-in-video-measurement-lawsuit-11570482031"&gt;settled the suit&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTey8e"&gt;The creators who spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have all diversified away from Facebook to avoid being overdependent on one platform; they all run YouTube channels along with their Facebook Pages as well as with other social pages. For the revenue-sharing model to work, Facebook needs creators to stay happy and posting. But increasingly, creators are skeptical of the company’s incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="51SOLh"&gt;“Working with platforms is hard,” Popkov says. “And you’re not working on your [own] platform, so it’s not like I can trust them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The unsettling surveillance of anti-Asian racism</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The rise of assaults on the elderly, captured on security camera footage, raises questions about policing and what really keeps people safe&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="q2KYkl"&gt;The video opens on a sunny Oakland street corner, where two men are walking down the sidewalk. The way they move, the composition of their bodies, suggests they don’t know each other. Their stances will feel familiar to anyone used to sharing city streets with strangers. The man in front appears older, walking with deliberate caution, when the other approaches quickly from behind and gives him one vigorous shove. The motion is swift, dispassionate. As the older man falls to the ground, the assailant bounds back with inverse force, releasing his hands above his head in what could be a display of triumph — or merely a reflex — before strolling out of the frame. The clip ends at five seconds, the old man lying still on the concrete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGyENZ"&gt;The whole thing is abrupt and sudden. Maybe you’ve seen it, autoplayed on loop, almost like a GIF, as it moves through your timelines. It was first shared by ABC7 San Francisco reporter Dion Lim on February 4th on &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CK3K274gTsx/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DionLimTV/status/1357410040462733312"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and an article &lt;a href="https://abc7news.com/shocking-video-shows-man-pushed-to-ground-in-oaklands-chinatown/10311111/"&gt;titled&lt;/a&gt; “Shocking video shows 91-year-old man senselessly pushed to ground in Oakland’s Chinatown.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtX9ZO"&gt;In under 24 hours, Lim’s video was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/danieldaekim/status/1357580443403567104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1357580443403567104%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fabc7news.com%2Fman-pushed-to-ground-in-oakland-daniel-dae-kim-wu-violence%2F10316560%2F"&gt;retweeted&lt;/a&gt; by actor Daniel Dae Kim, who condemned the “skyrocketing number of hate crimes against Asian Americans” and offered a $25,000 reward “for information leading to the arrest and conviction of this man and his accomplices.” The next day, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf held a press conference in Chinatown, using recent attacks on Asian Americans as a political gambit, criticizing efforts to reduce the police budget. “I have not forgotten that this last summer,” she said, when local officials “brought a proposal to cut $25 million from the Oakland police department as a political statement, not because of operational or financial need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vHenCe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re under attack and this is reality.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W2b3S6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4SdCw"&gt;The video came at a timely moment: for over a year, “China virus” rhetoric had fueled anti-Asian street harassment and violent attacks that went largely ignored by mass media and the general public. Finally, Asian American activists, community leaders, and journalists were getting national attention on the issue. Four days later, the assailant was apprehended by the police. Because of his court records and history with “&lt;a href="https://oaklandside.org/2021/02/12/oakland-chinatown-policing-hate-crimes-community/"&gt;significant mental health issues&lt;/a&gt;,” he was not charged with a hate crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMmTEV"&gt;The victim, it later turned out, wasn’t Asian, but a Latino man named Gilbert Diaz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFuJ5x"&gt;The man who sent the footage of the attack to Lim was Carl Chan, who represents the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce. Chan, who has spent the past 30 years trying to give a voice to his community, is currently working on installing even more surveillance cameras to deter further assaults. “We’re under attack and this is reality,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “It didn’t happen yesterday. It’s been happening for so many years, but we just caught the national attention [now].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVgHt2"&gt;That attention from the videos, Chan hopes, will justify demands for more policing to combat anti-Asian violence — a sentiment shared by many Oakland Chinatown residents and which, as Kim’s $25,000 bounty suggests, is not isolated to the Bay Area. But calls for increased police presence are in direct opposition to last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests that sought to raise awareness of the over-policing of Black people. The conflict is troubling: increased surveillance and policing may appear to keep one community safer, while putting others in greater peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lpKCZZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even evidence of racism toward Asians falls into stereotypes: distant, anonymous, dehumanized&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pd9EM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG9vpA"&gt;Violent footage from surveillance cameras has been effective in attracting national coverage of the rise of anti-Asian racism. And the viral reception of the videos has also flattened the conversation from one about decades of ongoing racial suffering to one centered on increasing policing, instead of how to effectively protect communities. And it appears the police know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAwCeB"&gt;Recordings of robberies and attacks are sent to the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce on a daily basis, Chan says. But when asked who sent him the video of Diaz’s attack, Chan demurred, growing defensive that I might not be here to report on the “real issues” but rather to make it an “anti-police story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyMnP3"&gt;He would not confirm where the video came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9rj6ZV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lJzC7KjMMNzpYCz1r9Ue2IjLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409151/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="lB5Gvt"&gt;Just days before the video of Gilbert Diaz’s attack went viral on Twitter, a similar one capturing the killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee outside his San Francisco apartment made national headlines. Both were caught on surveillance cameras, and both show what appears to be one man coming up behind another and shoving them before rushing away. Never mind the fact of Diaz’s race. These two videos continue to be widely circulated as proof of the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes, even though neither of them led to hate crime charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gw93B8"&gt;“They were saying that ‘we don’t see it.’ So with these videos, people are finally seeing that it’s actually happening,” Chan &lt;a href="https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2021/03/21/social-media-surveillance-videos-silence-doubters-of-asian-american-attacks/"&gt;said to CBSN Bay Area&lt;/a&gt;. “The videos are doing justice.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCzot9"&gt;These videos have come to exemplify what we might call a new genre of the anti-Asian hate crime media. They’re often sudden and impersonal — frequently taken from surveillance footage that often shows no other bodies around besides the assailant and the victim. These images stand in contrast to the many videos of police brutality against Black bodies, almost always filmed on phone cameras. The footage that captured the killings of Eric Garner and George Floyd follow an arc that’s familiar partly because we’ve seen it too many times — recordings that unfold with slow dread as we watch a Black man victimized by a racist police officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8vDMJo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every hate crime story is a policing story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RX7qkv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrxKB7"&gt;The videos of assaults on Asian Americans present a different horror: you’re witness to a scene of brutal violence that is so swift as to appear almost random, meaningless. Watching these attacks, it’s often impossible to tell the race of any of the bodies involved. The sound is often garbled, if there is any sound to be heard at all. Even evidence of racism toward Asians falls into stereotypes: distant, anonymous, dehumanized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aScWw1"&gt;The most recent viral video capturing &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/30/nyregion/attack-asian-woman-midtown.html"&gt;the attack of a 65-year-old Asian woman&lt;/a&gt; represents an escalation of this genre. The violence is even more brutal, but just as harrowing is the reluctance of building staff to intervene. One finally responds by shutting the door on the woman. (The building managers quickly responded in a public statement by condemning and firing these workers.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4H6RfS"&gt;The NYPD is investigating whether the assault was a targeted hate crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Arjg3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sSVUbnu98GxUsOg3PnIhqaquikY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409096/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: New York City Police Department&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The attack of a 65-year-old woman was recorded in front of 360 West 43rd St. in Manhattan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qxC5WD"&gt;Every hate crime story is a policing story. After all, “hate crime” (sometimes known as “bias crime”) emerged as a new legal category in the 1980s to charge felons motivated by prejudice. Yet the term reflects an oversimplification of the phenomenon it seeks to describe, given that law enforcement hinges on whether they can “prove” the perpetrator’s “hate” toward a target group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4z0B8"&gt;This was recently made explicit when a gunman attacked three Asian spas in the Atlanta, Georgia, area, killing six Asian women in addition to two other victims, and it spurred international debates over whether the act was a hate crime. Captain Jay Baker, speaking on behalf of the Cherokee County Sheriff’s office, explained that the shooter was “not racially motivated” but by “a temptation… he wanted to eliminate.” Baker’s implication that a crime, particularly one targeting three different Asian massage spas, could not entail both racial and gendered bias prompted immediate backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGmPC9"&gt;“In Atlanta, you have the police,” University of Texas Austin history professor Eric Tang tells me, “these investigators who have known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about racism, known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about misogyny, known &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; about Asian Americans, getting to determine and interpret what happened.” Which is all to say, as Tang puts it somberly, “that we’re not in a very good position, three decades down the line.” To that point, Baker was soon revealed to have posted images of T-shirts that read “Covid 19: imported virus from Chy-na” on social media and has since been removed from the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3i4H2V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The majority of crimes that are happening throughout the city are because people are desperate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2i9Io"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCTjos"&gt;Hate crimes present problems of legibility. Notoriously difficult to convict, hate crime cases often backfire — causing further harm in their disavowal of prejudice. Failures in hate crime convictions can “really just reinforce that designation,” explains Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh, “that there are certain groups that are acceptable targets for violence… because people don’t care as much about them,” which only further licenses the hate crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDWDsf"&gt;Even while the Cherokee County Sheriff’s office dismissed racial bias in the Atlanta shooting, local authorities did not hesitate in the immediate aftermath to send emergency patrols specifically to Asian neighborhoods, while police departments as far as Chicago and New York City also &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/georgia-spa-killings-police-patrols-asian-american-communities/story?id=76532692"&gt;stepped up patrolling&lt;/a&gt;. Just as opportunistic was Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who used the pretext of rising Chinatown attacks to take a swing at her political opponents and perhaps shift the reputational burden of policy. (Critics have repeatedly pointed out that the cuts to the police department decried by Schaaf came from her own administration.) Law enforcement and politicians alike are now banding together to weaponize attacks on Asian Americans Pacific Islanders (AAPI) to their own ends, often through highly spectacularized media events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l19u0j"&gt;Chaney Turner, a Black organizer who has lived in Oakland her entire life, sees the root cause of what is happening in her hometown as an issue of poverty. “Yes, there are some targeted crimes of people because of their race,” Turner explains, “but the majority of crimes that are happening throughout the city are because people are desperate. People are dealing with economic and mental health issues, and these are issues that we were experiencing before Covid.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8JPkA"&gt;Despite rising crime throughout Oakland during the COVID-19 pandemic, including Turner’s neighborhood in East Oakland, the mayor has focused on select communities like Oakland Chinatown. Some organizers like Chan are grateful for the attention: the policing of hate crimes offers the possibility of legitimizing the ongoing suffering and fear faced by many Asian Americans. Yet the punitive demands after anti-Asian attacks also go directly against the work of so many grassroots decriminalization efforts, some of which are AAPI-based like &lt;a href="http://apen4ej.org"&gt;APEN&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/asians4abolition/?hl=en"&gt;Asians 4 Abolition&lt;/a&gt;, among &lt;a href="https://caasf.org/press-release/asian-organizations-across-the-bay-area-join-forces-to-demand-action-against-violence/"&gt;many others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9eHow2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you only focus on hate crimes enforcement, then you’re only getting at a small slice of what’s happening out there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwQqKM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8nDSB"&gt;As history and research have exhaustively shown, more policing will inevitably result in greater harm to Black and Latinx communities. Take, for example, New York City’s quota-driven &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/upshot/stop-and-frisk-bloomberg.html"&gt;stop-and-frisk program&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in increasing risks to vulnerable populations of anxiety, depression, struggles in school, and community engagement in civic life, without being particularly helpful in fighting crime. Faced with growing terror and limited options, however, some Asian communities now feel that they must choose to protect their own by turning to the police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6elvw"&gt;Yet this false binary — between choosing or not choosing the police — is not a failure of the Asian community’s desire for safety, but a failure of policing. James Burch, policy director of the Anti Police-Terror Project, tells me about alternate models, unexplored by Schaaf, such as an ambassadorship program that provides “presence of safety” to communities. The choice, to him, doesn’t have to be how few or many police officers are deployed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ou8KC"&gt;As with other Oakland organizers like Turner, Burch is also frustrated with how Schaaf has used the violence against Asians as a photo op. “What I can’t allow is our current mayor weaponizing the situation to divide Black and Asian communities at a time when we are and have been working so hard to unite them,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfIoDw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJg-J3Rgk4kNubaVMMGfArVEBIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409135/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_003.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zp09fs"&gt;If proving anti-Asian racism has hinged on the hate crime, maybe the answer is to simply move away from the term and make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNSu7v"&gt;Founded in 1991, Asian Americans Advancing Justice launched the #StandAgainstHate platform in early 2017 in an effort to track “hate incidents,” as they’re called, against AAPI and Muslim communities that surged in the wake of Donald Trump’s election. Though it’s been the newer &lt;a href="https://stopaapihate.org/"&gt;Stop AAPI Hate&lt;/a&gt;, formed last March, that has garnered more recent media attention, with its rising record of hate incidents (the latest report counted 3,795) frequently cited across articles. Instead of hate crimes, Stop AAPI Hate co-founder Russell Jeung tells me, the broader category of hate incidents captures a range of events from online bullying to physical attacks that may not be criminally prosecutable but can still be traumatizing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNIeoT"&gt;Almost 90 percent of the reports Stop AAPI Hate receives are incidents rather than crimes — in other words, forms of verbal harassment or shunning that are often overlooked when it comes to accounting for anti-Asian racism. “Unless you understand the comprehensive nature of racism in all its forms,” Jeung says, “you can’t really address it well. If you only focus on hate crimes enforcement, then you’re only getting at a small slice of what’s happening out there.” One of the questions Jeung wants to ask, however, is whether simply reporting the hate incident — &lt;em&gt;calling it what it is&lt;/em&gt; — might help reduce harm, even minimally. In contrast to hate crime data, Jeung hopes to develop “a collective voice” that expresses a different type of racial trauma — one Stop AAPI Hate plans to study by working with the Asian American Psychological Association in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="iZieog"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even surveillance footage can ultimately obscure more than elucidate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6Ibkt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BgaSR"&gt;Yet because the accounting of this data remains unofficial and broadly defined, there is also always the problem, as sociologist Tamara K. Nopper &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7MNPXHT0wM"&gt;recently pointed out in a talk&lt;/a&gt;, of media literacy. Looking at Stop AAPI Hate’s data, which ranges from physical violence to shunning, Nopper asks, “What does it mean that the term hate encompasses all of these activities? And that hate is often being used interchangeably with violence?” As Stop AAPI Hate’s data keeps getting cited in news reports, Nopper warns, “this data source, as well as the hashtag, are part of what is kind of mobilizing this hate crime statistic collection; but also the passage for tougher legislation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eq5uyp"&gt;While the vast majority of anti-Asian hate incidents have been documented in writing, it has been videos of explicit physical violence that have come to dominate and drive awareness of the phenomenon. In a culture where anti-Asian racism remains difficult to represent, footage promises something like incontrovertible evidence. Though, as the video of Diaz’s attack suggests, even surveillance footage can ultimately obscure more than elucidate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYIxbN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDDuLPkR9jJhK42jAN7DvnOVhjo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409150/VRG_ILLO_4493_Spot_004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="F0J6Vz"&gt;A month after the video of Diaz’s attack was released, I went down to Oakland Chinatown to try to see if I could find the specific surveillance camera on which it was captured. I did. It wasn’t hard. The camera was hidden in plain sight outside an unassuming Chinese tailor shop. Though when I went inside to ask whether they owned the camera, I was redirected to the Asian Resource Center next door, where a security guard told me that all of the cameras around the building belonged to the Oakland police.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfswFI"&gt;The Oakland Police Department denied a records request for the video. After several emails with the department’s media office, a spokesperson responded but was unable to provide details of where the exact footage of Diaz’s attack came from. Instead, they informed me that the department does not technically &lt;em&gt;own&lt;/em&gt; any cameras in Chinatown and that they were typically maintained by commercial or residential property owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Jkz"&gt;With this new information, I returned to Chinatown in hopes of clarifying who exactly did own the surveillance camera. Back at the Asian Resource Center, a different security guard told me that, while he had no idea who managed the security system around the building, he was pretty sure the police had access. As to who owned the surveillance cameras? This security guard wasn’t sure about that either, but he suggested I try property management. I’d put in a call to building management a month ago, and they also would not confirm if the footage had been given to anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhRlpP"&gt;No one would claim responsibility for the footage, and yet, just last week, it played during a Fox News interview with Schaaf, cited alongside Ratanapakdee’s attack as examples of why Oakland needs to restore “desperately needed police services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhWl5c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Asians are seen as inoffensive, weak, vulnerable, and therefore, can be picked on.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pAnnzC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AYxEM"&gt;Toward the end of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s interview with Chan, he apologized for his earlier defensiveness around questions about the provenance of the footage. Moving away from the individual video of Diaz, Chan started talking about all of the other videos he’d received that he was unable to forward to the media. Oftentimes, it’s because the subjects involved want to protect their privacy. “I guess that’s why I’m actually sensitive about videos,” Chan admits. “I’m having trouble trying not to remember all these images… before I go to sleep, I try not to remember what I saw because I really couldn’t go to sleep every time I imagine, I’m thinking, &lt;em&gt;My God, how could our seniors be attacked?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75YoXC"&gt;For Chan, the desire for more patrols and cameras in Oakland Chinatown stems from a sense of desperate urgency — a desire to keep his community safe from what feels like endless injury with little relief in sight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g30E2g"&gt;Even those who disagree with Chan carry with them the history of unacknowledged pain. Earlier that day, I’d spoken with Gordon Chang, a professor of Asian American history at Stanford. We’d spoken about the violence, and though he disagreed with increased policing, he was sympathetic to Chan’s despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZnWj7"&gt;“Asians are seen as inoffensive, weak, vulnerable, and therefore, can be picked on. We all know that the Asians get picked on,” he’d put it bluntly. “This is our lot in life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LPRPiF"&gt;I’ll admit, something rings true about this sentiment — many anti-Asian hate crimes are also crimes of opportunism, targeting those who are socially viewed as unlikely to fight back or speak up. But it was a sunny day when I went in search of the surveillance camera that had caught Diaz’s attack. A year of the pandemic had heightened not just racial but also economic suffering. Walking around Chinatown, I observed restaurants and shops opening — some, but not all — as people shuffled on with their day, just outside the frame of that original video.&lt;/p&gt;
