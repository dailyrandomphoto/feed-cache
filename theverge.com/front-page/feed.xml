    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k86eje"&gt;A new document released as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; has revealed how much Epic paid developers to give away their games for free following the launch of the Epic Games Store in December 2018. The document, which was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1389297530341519362"&gt;spotted by writer Simon Carless&lt;/a&gt;, covers the 38 games given away free between December and September the following year. We already know that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380895/epic-games-store-afford-give-away-17-5-billion-free-games"&gt;Epic is spending millions on its giveaways&lt;/a&gt;, but the new document reveals how much that translates to on a per-game basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tv81v1"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381109913112489987"&gt;previously revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the company pays a flat fee to each developer to give away their games, rather than paying per download. Over the period covered by the document, Epic paid over $11.6 million in total for the games. In response to the deals, almost five million new users signed up to the store, which translates to Epic paying $2.37 for each new user it signed up in this period. That’s money which the company would theoretically make back if each new user went on to buy just one $20 game, based on the 12 percent commission Epic takes on new purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A table showing how much Epic paid for each free game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XYopGl"&gt;Beyond the ten months covered in the table, Epic says it’s acquired a total of 18.5 million new users via free game giveaways, and that around 7 percent of them, or about 1.3 million people, go on to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FrAPAs3LZaZ8eSjtrwGuZviBw4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22490554/image__8_.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A summary of how many total users Epic’s giveaways have attracted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MFTuaz"&gt;There’s a huge amount of variance between how much Epic paid for each giveaway. At the top end is the $1.5 million it paid to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20875378/batman-arham-asylum-city-knight-free-epic-games-store-lego-batman"&gt;give away the Batman Arkham trilogy games&lt;/a&gt;, but it also paid substantial amounts for &lt;em&gt;Subnautica &lt;/em&gt;($1.4 million) and M&lt;em&gt;utant Year Zero&lt;/em&gt; ($1 million). In comparison, the company paid much less for indie titles like &lt;em&gt;Super Meat Boy&lt;/em&gt; ($50,000), &lt;em&gt;Jackbox Party Pack&lt;/em&gt; ($60,000), and &lt;em&gt;Fez&lt;/em&gt; ($75,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijADBA"&gt;At only 38 titles, the list covers less than half &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1381021318640979968"&gt;of the 100+ games&lt;/a&gt; Epic has given away on its store since its launch. It also doesn’t cover one of Epic’s biggest giveaways from May 2020 when it made &lt;em&gt;GTA5 &lt;/em&gt;free on its store. Rockstar’s title proved so popular that the store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258043/epic-games-store-down-gta-5-grand-theft-auto-free-pc"&gt;was knocked offline for several hours&lt;/a&gt; as everyone tried to claim their free copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyt2Mh"&gt;As well as paying to give away existing games for free, Epic has also paid for upcoming games to be released exclusively on its store. Another document released as part of the legal proceedings and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1389372260067123200"&gt;found by Carless&lt;/a&gt; reveals that Epic paid a $146 million advance for a deal that included &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BwM2P"&gt;The new numbers were made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer is accusing Apple’s App Store of being a monopoly, and takes issue with the 30 percent commission Apple charges on many in-app purchases. With the court trial having kicked off this week, expect more of the inner workings of each company to be made public in the days ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple antitrust trial kicks off with Tim Sweeney’s metaverse dreams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple And Maker Of Popular Video Game Fortnite, Epic Enter Court Battle" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qoMGkcxInM3pZMqdvlZB3VJgrPc=/0x0:4976x3317/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69231267/1316070621.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WlIUrc"&gt;Epic Games launched its courtroom war against Apple in an extremely on-brand way: with CEO Tim Sweeney describing the metaverse from Neal Stephenson’s novel &lt;em&gt;Snow Crash&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFpYiA"&gt;It’s “a real-time, computer-powered 3D entertainment and social medium in which real people would go into a 3D simulation together and have experiences of all sorts,” Sweeney explained to a courtroom partitioned by plastic barriers and a series of teleconferencing hotlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UQLuvL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sweeney called Fortnite ‘a phenomenon that transcends gaming’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XJ0cpu"&gt;The metaverse is Sweeney’s chosen metaphor for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the battle royale game that Apple banned from its iOS App Store last year. Epic sued in retaliation, and today, both companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417725/apple-vs-epic-full-trial-slideshows-opening-arguments"&gt;delivered opening statements&lt;/a&gt; before Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers. Epic put Sweeney on the stand for hours of exhaustively detailed questions about — among other things — Epic’s Unreal Engine, gaming consoles, the App Store, and what players do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301688/fortnite-party-royale-christopher-nolan-movies-date"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; party island&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, Sweeney positioned &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as something much bigger than a simple video game: it’s “a phenomenon that transcends gaming,” he told the court. And in Epic’s narrative, Apple is unfairly demanding a cut of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GoeTm0"&gt;While Sweeney has referred to Epic’s fight with Apple as a “fireworks show,” today’s session wasn’t quite as dramatic as that suggests. Sweeney is a generally soft-spoken man who delivered testimony through a barely audible microphone setup after a long troubleshooting period that involved random teenagers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417347/epic-games-apple-fortnite-trial-public-call"&gt;yelling “free &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;!” into accidentally unmuted conference lines&lt;/a&gt;. Epic’s legal team was responsible for asking questions that set up Sweeney’s statements, resulting in queries both extremely tailored (“How would you define the metaverse?”) and comically general (“Are you familiar with something called a ‘console’?”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zXe1JB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Epic are holding battle lines they drew months ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DdIjDF"&gt;More generally, Apple and Epic were holding battle lines that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;they drew months ago&lt;/a&gt;. “Developers found themselves caught in a trap of Apple’s making,” Epic argued in its opening statement, and “the most prevalent flower in the walled garden was the Venus Flytrap.” Apple countered by calling Epic’s suit “a fundamental assault on Apple’s secure and integrated ecosystem.” In cross-examination, Apple’s attorney pushed Sweeney to confirm that Epic spent nearly a decade playing by Apple’s rules before launching an operation &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fortnites-mastermind-goes-to-battle-with-apple-11619236807"&gt;codenamed “Project Liberty”&lt;/a&gt; to flout them. Both sides promoted high-minded ideals (freedom for Epic, security for Apple) and appeared shocked — &lt;em&gt;shocked&lt;/em&gt; — that their opponent was trying to make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2irQVP"&gt;But hearing the arguments laid out helped clarify which tactics seem most likely to stick. Epic and Apple frame Epic’s demands very differently. Epic mostly stuck to discussing its most moderate request: that Apple let developers process in-app purchases through their own systems, bypassing Apple’s fee. Apple highlighted the most extreme ask: that Apple let iPhone owners side-load third-party app stores like the Epic Games Store. The former would be a big hit to Apple’s profits. The latter would transform iOS and poses security concerns that are much easier for Apple to lay out. (These are separate demands, so Judge Rogers could end up finding both parties’ arguments here compelling.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1ZGNJ0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Fortnite vs Apple: App Store Royale|78038" data-volume-uuid="e322ad1d6" data-volume-id="78038" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-300" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RYe8jr"&gt;Apple’s attorney didn’t finish cross-examining Sweeney on Monday. But he hammered on Epic’s willingness to deal with gaming companies like Sony, who lock down their consoles in ways that Apple compares to the iPhone. Sony, for instance, requires Epic to pay if a user plays &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; mostly on PlayStation but spends lots of money on another platform like PC. But Epic hasn’t complained about that deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAHYRW"&gt;On the other side, Epic can point to an intuitive sense that the iPhone platform is bigger and more all-encompassing than the Xbox or PlayStation. But Sweeney and its attorneys have drawn a much finer distinction involving its business model, saying that console makers typically sell their hardware at a loss, so they have an incentive to treat developers better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="BZQKpH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How is an iPhone like a PlayStation?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CwPSwv"&gt;Judge Rogers actively questioned that distinction during today’s testimony. “Apple did have to do something to the iPhone itself in terms of the technology of the iPhone in order for it to be sophisticated enough to play your software,” she said. “How is that any different than consoles — not so much about the payment piece, but about the development of the technology that allows your product to be played?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkBuCz"&gt;This trial is about the entire App Store model, and as witnesses from Apple begin taking the stand, that will become more clear. Epic will grill them about Apple’s business practices and whether it’s delivering on its promise of a safe, secure experience for developers and iOS users. But Sweeney neatly laid out a more personal vision of the conflict: &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is Epic’s answer to the web, and Apple wants 30 cents of every virtual dollar that an iPhone user spends in it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Inside the all-hands meeting that led to a third of Basecamp employees quitting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJWLQcF9Chp6MSCvWmke5f1HyWk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69231151/acastro_210503_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company’s senior leadership wanted to quell employees’ concerns, and only made things much, much worse&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="IyMbry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0vb44N"&gt;At 8AM PT on Friday, a bleary-eyed Basecamp CEO Jason Fried gathered his remote workforce together on Zoom to apologize. Four days earlier, he had thrown the company into turmoil by announcing that “societal and political discussions” &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;would no longer be allowed on the company’s internal chat forums&lt;/a&gt;. In his blog post, Fried said the decision stemmed from the fact that “today’s social and political waters are especially choppy,” and that internal discussions of those issues was “not healthy” and “hasn’t served us well.” The public reaction had been furious, and Fried said he was sorry for the way the new policies had been rolled out — but not for the policies themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UP1A7f"&gt;Behind the scenes, Fried had been dealing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy"&gt;an employee reckoning over a long-standing company practice of maintaining a list of “funny” customer names&lt;/a&gt;, some of which were of Asian and African origin. The internal discussion over that list had been oriented primarily around making Basecamp feel more inclusive to its employees and customers. But Fried and his co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson, had been taken aback by an employee post which argued that mocking customer names laid the foundation for racially-motivated violence, and closed the thread. They also disbanded an internal committee of employees who had volunteered to work on issues related to diversity, equity, and inclusion.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="unKmq2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“My honest sense of why everybody is leaving because they’re tired of Jason and David’s behavior”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CwgI8C"&gt;On Friday, employees had their chance to address these issues directly with Fried and his co-founder. What followed was a wrenching discussion that left several employees I spoke with in tears. Thirty minutes after the meeting ended, Fried announced that Basecamp’s longtime head of strategy, Ryan Singer, had been suspended and placed under investigation after he questioned the existence of white supremacy at the company. Over the weekend, Singer — who worked for the company for nearly 18 years, and authored a book about product management for Basecamp called &lt;em&gt;Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters&lt;/em&gt; — resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofYI9W"&gt;Within a few hours of the meeting, at least 20 people — more than one-third of Basecamp’s 57 employees — had announced their intention to accept buyouts from the company. And while many of them had been leaning toward resigning in the aftermath of Fried’s original post, the meeting itself pushed several to accelerate their decisions, employees said. The response overwhelmed the founders, who extended the deadline to accept buyouts indefinitely amid an unexpected surge of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Goz61p"&gt;This account is based on interviews with six Basecamp employees who were present at the meeting, along with a partial transcript created by employees. Collectively, they describe a company whose attempt to tamp down on difficult conversations blew up in its face as employees rejected the notion that discussions of power and justice should remain off limits in the workplace. And they suggest that efforts to eliminate disruptions in the workplace by regulating internal speech may cause even more turmoil for a company in the long run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u5H9xp"&gt;“My honest sense of why everybody is leaving because they’re tired of Jason and David’s behavior — the suppression of voices, of any dissent,” one employee told me. “They really don’t care what employees have to say. If they don’t think it’s an issue, it’s not an issue. If they don’t experience it, then it’s not real. And this was the final straw for a lot of employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="p4yoUM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SAygIt"&gt;While Friday’s meeting would eventually grow heated, it began on a conciliatory note. Fried, who employees described as looking tired, began the meeting by apologizing for announcing the policy changes by a public blog post rather than first telling all employees. Hansson tuned into the meeting from bed, where he reported that he was feeling ill, and after making introductory remarks turned off his camera for the duration of the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TS7AFV"&gt;Fried opened the floor for comments and questions. For the next two and a half hours, employees pressed the founders on the policy changes, the events leading up to them, and the state of the company. The first part of the meeting was devoted to discussing the events that had unfolded in the company’s internal Basecamp chat last month, in which an employee had cited the Anti-Defamation League’s “&lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/pyramid-of-hate.pdf"&gt;pyramid of hate&lt;/a&gt;” to argue that documents like the “funny” names list laid a foundation that contributes to racist violence and even genocide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zjmr1y"&gt;Roughly 90 minutes into the meeting, Singer raised his hand and spoke. One of Basecamp’s most senior executives, he had joined the company in 2003, when it was known as 37Signals and consisted of just four people. From his original role designing interfaces, Singer had risen to become head of strategy — essentially, Basecamp’s chief product officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="w5DMIW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The difficulty of this conversation is exactly why I raised it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uQxCjs"&gt;Along the way, he had also alienated some of his coworkers by promoting conservative views. In 2016, three employees said, he praised right-wing website Breitbart’s coverage of the presidential election in an internal forum. (About a week before rolling out the policy changes, the founders deleted nearly two decades of internal conversations from previous instances of Basecamp and its other collaboration products. Among other things, this made it more difficult for employees I spoke with to accurately describe past interactions with Singer in the forums.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrm2Be"&gt;In the April discussion about the list of customer names, Singer posted to say that attempting to link the list to genocide was “absurd.” On the Friday call, he went further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNKNUv"&gt;“I strongly disagree we live in a white supremacist culture,” Singer said. “I don’t believe in a lot of the framing around implicit bias. I think a lot of this is actually racist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gywgq"&gt;He continued: “Very often, if you express a dissenting view, you get called a Nazi. … I have not felt this is open territory for discussion. If we were to try to get into it as a group discussion it would be very painful and divisive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkLYJG"&gt;Singer concluded his remarks. Fried responded, “Thank you, Ryan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ba9euE"&gt;A handful of other speakers followed. Then a Black employee asked if the company could revisit Singer’s remarks. (I’m withholding the employee’s name and other identifying details out of colleagues’ fears that they could be targeted for harassment for speaking out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="remEHs"&gt;“The fact that you can be a white male, and come to this meeting and call people racist and say ‘white supremacy doesn’t exist’ when it’s blatant at this company is white privilege,” the employee said. “The fact that he wasn’t corrected and was in fact thanked — it makes me sick.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ftS6op"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it’s absolutely the most disgusting thing in the world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C53unh"&gt;Fried went to move on, but other employees pressed him for more of a response from him and Hansson. At that point, employees said, Singer spoke up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6V5r88"&gt;“I can gladly respond,” he said. “I stand by what I said. Saying white people have something in common is racist. I stand by it … I am very sure I don’t treat people in a racist way.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MY5yX7"&gt;(Singer remembers one of these quotes differently: “I said that claiming anybody &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; have a certain viewpoint because of the color of their skin is racist,” he said today.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lW6aTC"&gt;The Black employee said they did not want to hear from Singer, but after some cross-talk, he finished his statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAChcq"&gt;“The difficulty of this conversation is exactly why I raised it,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFEwSV"&gt;The Black employee responded: “You said, ‘white supremacy doesn’t exist.’ That’s a factual lie. It’s not true.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JcSgdD"&gt;To which Singer responded: “I said we have different ways of framing … If you want to debate whether it exists anywhere, then yeah. But not here at this company, not with the people I associate with.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m12yWH"&gt;“It exists right now,” another employee said. “This is fucking bullshit. You are being ridiculous.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCZZON"&gt;“I don’t accept that framing,” Singer responded. “It’s not productive to argue further. I don’t want to argue. This difference in views, it is what makes a political discussion so difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIH8rK"&gt;Employees once again pressed Fried and Hansson for a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qavAn9"&gt;“I don’t like hearing that someone doesn’t feel valued,” Fried said. “I don’t know what to say … I can understand why [the employee] feels uncomfortable right now. I feel terrible about it. I don’t know how else to respond.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tj5Stk"&gt;The employee called for the founders to denounce white supremacy. “That would be the bare minimum for me,” they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkObmF"&gt;“I’m not here to share my personal views on anything,” Fried said. “I’m horrified when one group dominates another.” Fried, who is Jewish, added that he had lost relatives during the Holocaust. “I think it’s absolutely the most disgusting thing in the world … I can’t say that’s happening here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTKtfo"&gt;Fried added that he didn’t “know what to say about specific terms. I don’t know how to satisfy that right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUO5yN"&gt;Hansson remained on mute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sijBaw"&gt;It was in that exchange that several employees decided to quit Basecamp, I’m told. Two employees told me that they had found themselves crying and screaming at the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvLvpl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Evil is not required”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsLvbI"&gt;“This was the test, as far as I’m concerned,” one told me later. “Do you protect this extremely senior employee that you’ve protected for many years? And [the answer] was yes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gxPso"&gt;Over the next hour, employees continued to come forward to discuss Basecamp’s new policies and what would be like going forward. But before the meeting ended, one employee spoke up to address Singer’s remarks directly in a way that Fried and Hansson did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3aAZ12"&gt;“Racism [and] white supremacy are not things that are so convenient that they only happen when full intention is present, or true malice is present,” the employee said. “Evil is not required. We’re not so lucky as for this to come down to good and evil. It’s as simple as creating a space where people do not feel welcome.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z21bjH"&gt;The employee continued: “The silence in the background is what racism and white supremacy does. It creates that atmosphere that feels suffocating to people. It doesn’t require active malice. It’s not that convenient.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aED08y"&gt;The meeting broke up after no more employees had questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cNXurP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eRPXDT"&gt;A half hour after the meeting ended, Fried posted an internal note saying that Singer has been suspended pending an investigation. He added that the company was bringing in unspecified outside “help” to address the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="33TOl7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I objected to an employee’s statement that we live in a white supremacist culture”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JCh25E"&gt;On Monday morning, in an interview, Fried told me that Singer had resigned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjKZGt"&gt;I asked Fried to clarify his remarks during the Friday meeting, which had clearly caught him off guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5WDxt"&gt;“I denounce white supremacy unconditionally,” he told me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhNPYF"&gt;Fried declined to answer my other questions on the record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3iPzM"&gt;I also asked Singer about his remarks. Here is what he said, over email, in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qksCj8"&gt;“I objected to an employee’s statement that we live in a white supremacist culture. White supremacism exists, and America’s history of racism still presents terrible problems, but I don’t agree that we should label our entire culture with this ideology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KPIvX"&gt;On the call, the view I gave was we all want a future where everyone is treated fairly.  And yet there can be disagreement on whether defining our culture as ‘white supremacist’ helps us to get there. The subject is so charged that discussing such disagreements at work quickly leads to misunderstanding, heated accusations, and loss of faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F50CH5"&gt;Unfortunately, painful misunderstanding did result. Tensions were so high after the call that I decided it won’t be tenable to stay on the team. I gave my resignation over the weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W4YD1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IV. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="JrxUlQ"&gt;This week was to have been Basecamp’s (virtual) biannual meetup, in which employees come together to bond over social activities while talking about the future of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lSFfho"&gt;Those discussions will still take place, but amidst a backdrop in which some of the company’s most senior leadership has abruptly departed. More employees are likely to follow in the coming weeks as they find new jobs and make other arrangements, I’m told. In the meantime, no changes to the policies that Fried laid out last week are planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8W5LM"&gt;Fried and Hansson’s moves last week, and the discussion around them, revealed clear fault lines between executives and workers that go far beyond Basecamp. Founders at Coinbase, Basecamp, and other companies have sought to quash internal dissent that, in their view, distracts workers from the company mission and makes everyone miserable. To a manager, the exchange that led to Singer’s departure could lend credence to the idea that addressing social injustices on company Zoom calls is bound to be disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb2FMr"&gt;Meanwhile, employees at those companies have recoiled at what appear to be transparent efforts to prevent their workplaces from becoming more diverse, equitable, and inclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zglUYT"&gt;No one I interviewed offered a confident prediction about how the past week’s events would affect Basecamp over the long term. On one hand, it’s clear that the five books Fried and Hansson wrote &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/books"&gt;lecturing other people about good management&lt;/a&gt; made them a lot of enemies, at least on Twitter, where they have been criticized relentlessly. On the other hand, as one employee told me, it’s not clear that average Basecamp customers know or care much about Basecamp the company, and no one predicts a mass revolt of the user base.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OPTXWz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The founders refused to lead, and so the company was doing it itself”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TIiqFz"&gt;But as much as the conversation about Basecamp’s moves has been framed as “politics,” it seems important to remember that the entire affair began when a third of the company — not all of whom are among the 20 who have departed so far, by the way — volunteered to help the company become more diverse and equitable. It was only when their committee dug a skeleton out of the company closet — that list of names — that Fried and Hansson moved to shut the whole thing down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrihET"&gt;“It was actually a positive thing we were doing,” one employee told me, marveling at the chaos that had followed. “We had identified the problem, how it happened, and vowed not to do it again. It was a company doing exactly what it should do. The founders refused to lead, and so the company was doing it itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzVgkI"&gt;Another employee said they had been thrown by the fact that the founders, after years of telling employees that they were part of an elite chosen few who were good enough to work at Basecamp, would get rid of them so easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9Vaurp"&gt;“They just want to build cool shit all day,” the employee said. “They don’t want to deal with people, which is something you have to do as a manager … Jason and David just threw us away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsbHq4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of the article misattributed two quotes. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="AYTEqc"&gt;
&lt;p id="I0se5c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arrival and Uber are working on an electric ride-hailing car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UPK4omPz0C7LIB6y9GSMi4xw0qI=/188x0:2213x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230776/Arrival_Uber_Car_Shot_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Arrival&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xXbnsF"&gt;UK-based EV startup Arrival is working with Uber to develop an electric car that will be “purpose-built” for ride-hailing. Arrival plans to put the car into production in late 2023 and says it will not be exclusive to Uber. Instead, the startup says the goal is to create an affordable vehicle that would appeal to the millions of ride-hailing drivers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCxZMA"&gt;It’s another vote of confidence in Arrival, which just became &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/british-ev-firm-arrival-arvl-goes-public-via-spac-today.html"&gt;a publicly traded company in March&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. Founded in 2015, Arrival is also developing electric delivery vans (with UPS as a customer) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293615/arrival-uk-electric-bus-ev-photos"&gt;buses&lt;/a&gt;. It also has backing from Hyundai and Kia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzhAA6"&gt;Arrival and Uber released a handful of renderings of the new car’s interior and said a final design will be revealed by the end of the year. Between now and then, the companies plan to get some drivers involved in the design process, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MALV8l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10481187"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz9ihL"&gt;What’s being teased in the images that were released is not some radical rethink of what a car should be like on the inside — in fact, in comparison to the concept cars we see every year at auto shows around the world, it’s quite familiar. There’s a large horizontal screen mounted to the dashboard, similar to what’s in Tesla’s Model 3 and Model Y (and the forthcoming Model S and Model X refresh), and the steering wheel is also quite similar to what’s found in a Tesla, with just two scroll wheels and no driver display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeC70q"&gt;But there are a few subtle differences that Arrival says could enhance the ride-hailing experience for both drivers and passengers. The driver’s seat is ergonomically designed to ease the physical strain of sitting in a car for hours on end. The front passenger seat folds up to create more leg room. There’s a bench-style seat in the rear, which makes it easier to get in and out of the vehicle. And there are small, lighted cubbies and handrails on the inside of each door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l30tns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The key will be affordability&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Byyu5l"&gt;The goal is to make “hundreds of small improvements, changes, and tweaks to the design that perhaps haven’t been applied before,” according to Tom Elvidge, Arrival’s senior vice president of mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sr1wxX"&gt;Electric vehicles can make a lot of sense in a ride-hailing setting. They tend to have fewer moving parts than internal combustion cars, and therefore require less maintenance and upkeep. They’re also inherently compliant with the zero-emission zones that have been adopted in cities across Europe, as well as broader internal combustion bans that are on the horizon. But electric vehicles are, currently, more expensive than the cheapest internal combustion or hybrid cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5krzdH"&gt;The goal is to design an affordable vehicle from the outset, Elvidge says, though Arrival believes it can broadly reduce the cost of manufacturing electric vehicles by using so-called “microfactories,” or highly automated, small-footprint facilities where it plans to build its vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szBhS6"&gt;Arrival has yet to prove that strategy can work. Like many of its SPAC peers, it is still in the developmental phase and has yet to actually sell any production vehicles. Uber has quietly poked at a number of electric vehicle startups over the last few years but never struck any deals, though it has recently cleaved a number of money-losing divisions, like the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;focused on autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; and the one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22086597/uber-sells-flying-taxi-elevate-joby-aviation"&gt;dedicated to flying taxis&lt;/a&gt;. The partnership with Arrival, then, may be a sign that it’s ready to try to execute on its promise to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;100 percent of its rides&lt;/a&gt; happen in electric vehicles in the US, Canada, and Europe by 2030 — a goal Uber said it would reach by partnering with a variety of companies across the transportation industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Impossible Foods clears legal battle over the ingredient that makes its meat ‘bleed’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Impossible Burger" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HrsneG7wySnBz4ztpZihjghQ8QE=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230584/1297646110.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Close-up shot of the Impossible Foods Company’s product Impossible Burger in Walnut Creek, California, January 11, 2021. | Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Moa3Q"&gt;A San Francisco federal appeals court upheld a decision by the Food and Drug Administration to allow Impossible Foods to use “heme,” the additive the company says makes its products “&lt;a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/heme"&gt;taste like meat&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecvfbT"&gt;Had Impossible Foods lost this legal battle, it could have dealt a heavy blow to the company. Genetically engineered heme is what sets its products apart from other competitors like Beyond Meat that don’t use the ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s3JJ01"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Heme is what sets its products apart from other competitors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NW1uYm"&gt;The FDA used a weaker legal standard than it should have to approve the use of heme, the nonprofit Center for Food Safety argued in a lawsuit it filed last year. It said the FDA made its decision based on safety standards for food additives rather than on standards for color additives, which stipulate that there needs to be “convincing evidence” that the color additive causes no harm. Heme is a red ingredient that makes Impossible Foods’ products appear to “bleed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGLXuC"&gt;The appeals court ruling said that the FDA had “substantial evidence” to deem heme in Impossible Foods safe to eat, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-03/impossible-foods-wins-ruling-to-continue-use-of-key-additive?sref=DWzi38c2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported today. It also allowed the FDA to rely on research commissioned by Impossible Foods in its decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpdRz3"&gt;Impossible Foods shared its own data with a food safety panel of experts from several universities for review and then conducted &lt;a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/blog/the-agonizing-dilemma-of-animal-testing"&gt;rat feeding studies&lt;/a&gt; to address questions from the FDA. “We have no questions at this time regarding Impossible Foods’ conclusion that soy leghemoglobin preparation is [generally recognized as safe] under its intended conditions of use to optimize flavor in ground beef analogue products intended to be cooked,” the FDA &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/116243/download"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64Ek6z"&gt;The Center for Food Safety, on the other hand, said there needs to be more analysis. “FDA should have required additional independent testing to make sure that this new substance does not cause allergic reactions or other health problems in people,” Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the Center for Food Safety, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/5961/center-for-food-safety-filed-lawsuit-against-fda-challenging-decision-to-approve-genetically-engineered-soy-protein-found-in-the-impossible-burger"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkoPsn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gYq21"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVzpPS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Thursday Night Football deal will start early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Seattle Seahawks v San Francisco 49ers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tNyNQLJxAIy7TIhh1vriNZaibK0=/0x0:3790x2527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230358/1295550077.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A9LOTc"&gt;Amazon made history as the first all-digital streamer to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;acquire exclusive rights to the NFL’s &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and now &lt;a href="https://nflcommunications.com/Pages/AMAZON-PRIME-VIDEO-TO-BECOME-THE-EXCLUSIVE-HOME-OF-THURSDAY-NIGHT-FOOTBALL-BEGINNING-WITH-THE-2022-SEASON.aspx"&gt;the NFL has announced&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon will be streaming games sooner than expected — starting with the 2022 season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4rHeRC"&gt;The NFL’s previous announcement set the start of Amazon’s exclusivity in 2023. Now Amazon gets its exclusive rights even sooner and for even longer thanks to a new 11-year contract matching the NFL’s other partners, including CBS, NBC (and Peacock), and Fox. That means 2021 will mark the final season with Fox broadcasting &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="smS9ZN"&gt;One important note: Amazon’s exclusivity doesn’t extend to local markets. You should still be able to watch &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; on an over-the-air broadcast if your team is playing, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/03/amazons-thursday-night-football-package-will-begin-in-2022-instead-of-2023.html"&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0MvgBQ"&gt;Amazon’s history hosting &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; actually &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nfl.com%2Fnews%2Fnfl-amazon-prime-announce-tnf-streaming-deal-0ap3000000797854&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F3%2F22417957%2Famazon-nfl-thursday-night-football-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;began in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, when it handled the digital streaming of games while NBC and CBS handled the OTA broadcasts. Later OTA broadcasts were handled by Fox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egeBKA"&gt;The online retail giant also gained &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241195/amazon-nfl-games-thursday-saturday-streaming-twitch-prime-video"&gt;exclusive access to some Saturday games in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Before that, Amazon was reportedly considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/20/18104821/amazon-fox-sports-network-disney-bid-twitch-nfl"&gt;buying multiple Fox sports channels&lt;/a&gt; outright as a way to aggressively get into sports. Amazon’s current offerings aren’t anything to sneeze at, but it’s not hard to imagine a future where Amazon streams an even bigger NFL event, like say, the Super Bowl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMorbe"&gt;Now if you want to watch a &lt;em&gt;Thursday Night Football&lt;/em&gt; game and it doesn’t involve the team in your broadcast region, then watching via Amazon is the only way to go. While that may be annoying for those who don’t have a Prime account, it will probably still be better than dropping $50 for NFL Game Pass, which is subject to brutal blackout periods that can often make it feel like a waste of a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite made more than $9 billion in revenue in its first two years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/omGWhEnKWsunn90E3dhwmh02eTY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69228857/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FSHy4T"&gt;After a meteoric rise to popularity in 2018, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; generated more than $5 billion in its first year for Epic Games, new financial documents reveal. The document, made public as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic’s court battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the latter’s App Store practices, shows that the game brought in more than $9 billion total for Epic in 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjcOKW"&gt;The document doesn’t break down how much Epic specifically profited from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but the company reported more than $5.5 billion in profit from the two-year period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3adjc"&gt;In the document, the company predicted that it would have almost $3.6 billion in revenue for 2020. Epic doesn’t usually publicly provide financial statements, but CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1389295991602380803"&gt;Tim Sweeney’s recent testimony&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it actually made much more: $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Sweeney says Epic employs 3200 people, has offices around the world and (this might be new info?) made $5.1bn in gross revenue in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;— erin griffith (@eringriffith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eringriffith/status/1389295991602380803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KJmiaI"&gt;The revenue from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; far outshone any other businesses that Epic ran at the time — “other games” (such as &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;acquired by Epic in 2019&lt;/a&gt;) made $108 million in revenue in 2018 and 2019, and Epic’s engine brought in $221 million over the same span. Epic’s Game Store, launched at the end of 2018, brought in a total of $235 million between 2018 and 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s once again time to update your iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch as soon as possible</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KaNOSNGw-Fr6G6BSHVThms2YyUc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69230068/acastro_170731_1777_0004_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IcVriv"&gt;I know there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a ton of other Apple news happening today&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re reading it on a Mac, iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch (okay, that last one may be a stretch), you should probably pause and update that device — today’s update fixes a security issue that &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;Apple says&lt;/a&gt; may have been actively exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPKvyv"&gt;The updates contained in &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212336"&gt;iOS / iPadOS 14.5.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212335"&gt;macOS 11.3.1&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212339"&gt;watchOS 7.4.1&lt;/a&gt; are meant to fix arbitrary code execution exploits present in WebKit, Apple’s framework that renders most of the web content you see on your device (unless you’re using, say, Chrome or Firefox on Mac). In normal language, the updates patch a hole that let malicious websites run unchecked code on your device, so it’s not the type of update you want to put off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8xbf2"&gt;If you have an older device, such as an iPhone 5s or 6, iPad Air or Mini 2 and 3, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212341"&gt;Apple also released iOS 12.5.3&lt;/a&gt;, which addresses WebKit flaws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIiN7j"&gt;If this story sounds a little familiar, it’s because there have been two recent updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22251149/iphone-update-14-4-fixes-exploited-security-vulnerabilities"&gt;iOS 14.4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352676/iphone-ios-update-fixes-xss-exploit-security-issue"&gt;14.4.2&lt;/a&gt;, that closed similar security holes. Even if you don’t think you should update because you use an alternative web browser on your Mac, or don’t browse the web on your Apple Watch (for obvious reasons), it’s still worth updating any devices you may have — WebKit can be used in unexpected places, and it’s never good to have security holes open on your devices, especially ones that may have been exploited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BDV7F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article stated that the iOS 12.5.3 update was available for the iPhone 5. It is actually available for the iPhone 5s. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates and Melinda Gates are separating, but their charitable foundation will continue</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="wWfAMA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BillGates/status/1389316412259270657"&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/melindagates/status/1389316399428866049"&gt;Melinda Gates&lt;/a&gt; have announced that they’ll be ending their marriage after 27 years together, explaining in a joint statement that they “no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Icvnt"&gt;Bill Gates is best known as the founder of Microsoft, who leveraged his fortune at the helm of that company working together with Melinda Gates to form the &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/"&gt;Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;/a&gt; in 2000. The Gates Foundation has since grown to become one of — if not the largest — charitable foundations in the world, with an endowment of almost $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKWy6O"&gt;Bill had previously stepped away from his &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/2000/01/13/mu7.html#18b884f65d83"&gt;positions at Microsoft as CEO&lt;/a&gt; (in 2000), &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-microsoft-gates/bill-gates-bids-a-teary-farewell-to-microsoft-idUSN2630130120080628"&gt;a full-time employee&lt;/a&gt; (in 2008), and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;member of the company’s board&lt;/a&gt; in order, he claims, to better focus on philanthropy. Melinda had previously worked as a product marketing manager at Microsoft and oversaw a number of software launches before leaving in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLJcV5"&gt;It’s not clear what impact the Gates’ separation will have on the Gates Foundation. According to the released statement, the Gates still both share a belief in the Gates Foundation’s mission and “will continue our work together at the foundation” despite their separation. While both Bill and Melinda — along with fellow multibillionaire Warren Buffett — serve as trustees for the Gates Foundation, the foundation is led by CEO Mark Suzman.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are Apple’s and Epic’s full slideshows arguing why they should win at trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncr4l-L-A4U6IklCTAA7TgKXwGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69229294/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVIIeO"&gt;Both Apple and Epic have released their opening presentations on why they feel they should win this week’s trial, which is set to determine &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;the future of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. In the documents, which you can look through below, each company lays out its case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXsOf4"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief"&gt;lawsuit started&lt;/a&gt; when Apple removed Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;from the App Store after Epic bypassed Apple’s system for in-app purchases. But it’s turned into a much deeper examination of Apple’s walled-garden approach to technology, and whether some of the walls the company puts up might violate antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01XMHx"&gt;We took &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373826/epic-games-v-apple-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-lawsuit"&gt;a deeper look at the companies’ legal strategies&lt;/a&gt; in advance of the trial, but you can see the same arguments play out in these presentations. Epic uses metaphors of brick walls and gas stations to argue that Apple’s control over what can and cannot be installed on the iPhone is unfair, and that allowing other methods of installing apps wouldn’t harm iOS’s security. Apple pushes back saying that Epic getting the openness that it wants would harm not just the App Store but other stores from Sony and Nintendo. &lt;/p&gt;
