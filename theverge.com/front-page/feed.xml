    <title>Chuck Schumer wants to replace every gas car in America with an electric vehicle</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Senate majority leader is reviving his plan to give people discounts for swapping their gas car for an electric one&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UnXkqU"&gt;With the $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill signed into law, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is ready to tackle the next major challenge: President Joe Biden’s call for a massive infrastructure bill. As part of that package, Schumer said he plans to include his ambitious proposal to get every American to swap their gas-guzzling car for an electric one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4s4nuu"&gt;“It’s a bold new plan designed to accelerate America’s transition to all electric vehicles on the road, to developing a charging infrastructure, and to grow American jobs through clean manufacturing,” Schumer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a brief interview this week. “And the ultimate goal is to have every car manufactured in America be electric by 2030, and every car on the road be clean by 2040.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dBBWh"&gt;The top-line details of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931983/schumer-electric-car-trade-in-gas-discount-proposal-zero-emission"&gt;“cash for clunkers’’-style plan&lt;/a&gt; haven’t changed much since Schumer first proposed it in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/opinion/chuck-schumer-electric-car.html"&gt;an op-ed in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But the political landscape has certainly shifted in favor of the Democrats, breathing new life into the idea. Under the proposal, anyone who trades in their gas car for an electric one would get a “substantial” point-of-sale discount, Schumer says. He wouldn’t say how much of a discount, only that it would be “deep.” A spokesperson later confirmed they are eyeing rebates that are “more generous” than the current $7,500 federal EV tax credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="a6zi7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Schumer wouldn’t say how much of a discount, only that it would be “deep”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5eDHPZ"&gt;He also wants to provide direct incentives to auto manufacturers to phase out their production of internal combustion engine vehicles and tax breaks for property owners to install EV chargers at their homes or apartment buildings. Lastly, he proposes to send direct subsidies to local governments to improve and expand the nation’s network of EV charging stations. Schumer would deploy $45 billion in grants to upgrade the nation’s charging infrastructure and $17 billion to encourage manufacturers to retrofit their facilities for EV production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARyu2K"&gt;There are still details to work out, such as how much of a discount to give each person who trades in a car, and how to structure the plan so the lowest-income earners receive the most cash back. Schumer estimates that the plan will cost $454 billion over 10 years to implement, compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/us/politics/biden-climate-plan.html"&gt;$2 trillion Biden has said he would spend&lt;/a&gt; on his infrastructure and climate proposal. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ojSVbU"&gt;Biden would probably be agreeable to Schumer’s plan — there are elements of it already included in the president’s Build Back Better proposal — though a spokesperson for the White House did not respond to a request for comment. Since taking office, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;Biden has signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; to replace the government’s fleet of almost 650,000 vehicles with all-electric models produced in the US. And he pledged to spend billions of dollars to add over half a million EV charging stations in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iESF99"&gt;Given those facts, Schumer’s convinced that Biden will be an easy sell. “I haven’t sat down and discussed the whole thing with them,” Schumer said of the White House, “but yes, I think it is going to be part of the infrastructure plan.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ulNm2O"&gt;Since first announcing the plan, Schumer has sought out support from labor unions and auto manufacturers. So far, three powerful labor unions have endorsed the plan: the AFL-CIO, UAW, and IBEW. With their buy-in, the majority leader is convinced that the proposal will have an easier path to approval, even with Republicans largely opposed to anything that originates from a Democrat’s desk. Still, he’s optimistic that he can peel away a few Republican votes, thanks to broad support for electrification from the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uQkdVk"&gt;“I’m excited by the substance of the proposal,” Schumer said, “but I’m also excited by the politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gMbf1L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m excited by the substance of the proposal, but I’m also excited by the politics.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gz2dPp"&gt;There has been &lt;a href="https://usa.streetsblog.org/2019/10/25/six-reasons-why-schumers-ev-plan-takes-a-wrong-turn/"&gt;criticism by transit advocates&lt;/a&gt; who would rather see that sum of money spent on strengthening the nation’s public transportation infrastructure, especially at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a huge drop-off in ridership. (The recently approved American Rescue Plan of 2021 includes $30.5 billion for transit.) The government shouldn’t be spending money on incentives for car purchases, regardless if they’re electric, they argue, when congestion and sprawl are such major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJ43Ky"&gt;Schumer said he’s working on a “large investment in clean mass transit” right now, which he also hopes to include as part of the Democratic infrastructure proposal. “Transit is an integral part of the way to revolutionize the way we move around,” he said, though he declined to say whether more money should be spent on public transportation than his gas-for-electric swap idea. “I’m not going to compare. We need to do both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atFXkM"&gt;Another potential problem for Schumer’s plan is the current state of the electric grid in the US. Electric vehicles are only as green as their power source, and &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Coal%20was%20the%20second%2Dlargest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25."&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;, 38 percent of the nation’s power supply comes from natural gas, 23 percent comes from coal, 20 percent from nuclear power, and only 17 percent from renewable sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Senators Hold Media Availability On Capitol Hill" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E0RHnqsghCmTSVQfo0veYIT3cTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22377115/1231753968.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Kevin Dietsch-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wdmh3V"&gt;Schumer noted that while his proposal doesn’t specifically address the electrical grid, he is a co-sponsor of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430616/democrats-thrive-agenda-economy-pandemic-racism-climate-change-resolution-congress"&gt;THRIVE Act&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for federal investments to boost renewable energy. Included among the 83 co-sponsors are Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), co-authors of the Green New Deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OggfR"&gt;The progressive wing of the Democratic Party has pushed to get Schumer to sign on to the Green New Deal, but he says he prefers his alternative approach. “The THRIVE agenda is a practicalization of the Green New Deal,” Schumer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aW5NfZ"&gt;Schumer also wouldn’t go so far as to say he would support a federal ban on the sale of gas-powered vehicles. The European Union has said it wants to &lt;a href="https://www.coltura.org/world-gasoline-phaseouts"&gt;phase out gas car sales&lt;/a&gt; by 2035, with some nations like Ireland, Sweden, and the Netherlands saying they would ban the sale of new gas cars much sooner, by 2030. A number of US states have signed on to similar timelines, including California, the largest auto market in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFjUbP"&gt;Major auto producers have also said they would sell only electric vehicles within the next 10 to 15 years, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22325813/vw-volkswagen-power-day-battery-electric-car-announcement"&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt;, and others. But Schumer declined to say whether he would support a national plan to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars, saying he prefers using a carrot rather than a stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FEuZ"&gt;“Our proposal will do the most that can be passed,” he said. “My goal is to pass into law the boldest change, and I think this is sort of the sweet spot where that is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RTRqgG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our proposal will do the most that can be passed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knRU7m"&gt;Today, anyone who buys an electric car is eligible for a $7,500 federal tax credit in addition to any local tax credits that exist at the state level, depending on where they live. The incentive was created by the Obama administration in 2009 to encourage automakers to embrace electrification. It was also meant to help consumers offset the price of a new EV, many of which were (and still are) too expensive for most Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFicyf"&gt;But the credit was never meant to be permanent, and a cap of 200,000 vehicles sold was included. Once a car company passes that mark, the tax credit slowly phases out over a period of 18 months. In recent years, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/12/17563908/tesla-federal-tax-credit-ending-date"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166619/gm-ev-tax-credit-bolt-sales"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; have hit the 200,000-vehicle threshold and have begun to phase out the credit. But Schumer says the tax credit is targeted at “affluent” people, whereas his plan applies to everyone across the economic spectrum, including “people who don’t pay taxes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4HZeb"&gt;Electric cars aren’t the only battery-powered vehicles that are changing the way people get around. Electric scooters and bikes have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;exploded in popularity&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, with environmental advocates touting them as an even greener mode of transportation than EVs. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;A bill was recently introduced in the House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; that would give a refundable tax credit of 30 percent on the purchase of a new e-bike, which Schumer says he would support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9tMaE"&gt;“I would like to look at the broad range of transportation,” he said. “We’re looking at mass-transit buses and subways right now. And I’d like to make it as expansive as possible — scooters, everything. I’m a bicycle rider. Obviously, that’s very clean.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DzvZCB"&gt;He added, “Things like that, we’d like to expand and incentivize.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9nsY2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0SKaVo"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIjRgy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60bBfd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Labor board reportedly sides with Amazon workers who protested COVID-19 safety policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSpvb-puSS1hWet--4qYftXhRnU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981248/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YYYZP0"&gt;Amazon and US labor regulators are reportedly negotiating a settlement for workers who protested Amazon’s COVID-19 safety standards. &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) found merit in a retaliation complaint from Chicago warehouse employees. According to text messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;, the NLRB said on March 10th that “Amazon has stated its intent to settle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvvPen"&gt;Workers have requested, among other things, that Amazon contact employees and “make clear that their rights will not be violated again.” The complaint alleged that Amazon unlawfully retaliated against workers after they launched a series of safety strikes last year, asking for the company to cover COVID-19 medical costs and offer more transparency if a person on-site contracted the coronavirus. Amazon and the NLRB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV5MDu"&gt;The NLRB can’t assess penalties against Amazon, but it can require “make-whole remedies” that prevent future violations. As &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; explains, an investigation can also push companies to back off of intimidation campaigns or other offenses, making it easier for employees to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8D8585"&gt;If a settlement isn’t reached, the NLRB could issue a formal complaint and schedule a hearing on the case. That’s what happened last December, when it &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/amazon-worker-retaliation-coronavirus"&gt;found merit in a complaint&lt;/a&gt; from Philadelphia employee Courtney Bowden. Last month, the NLRB also sided with Alabama workers seeking to vote on a union, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268280/amazon-nlrb-denied-union-election-alabama-warehouse"&gt;denying Amazon’s request&lt;/a&gt; to delay the vote. That vote — which could mark the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272213/amazon-union-bhm1-alabama-rwdsu-vote-begins"&gt;first US employee union&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon’s history — will conclude at the end of March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mortal Kombat’s producer says the movie’s violence is ‘like Bambi’ compared to the games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjWxp2EL8750cwK_WbvGtkMRDsw=/554x0:2354x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981126/MK_T1_0073r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6jNf9D"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jBa_aHwCbC4"&gt;recent trailer&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming movie adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; makes the film look &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; violent. In one scene, &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; icon Sub-Zero slices an opponent’s arm with a sword, freezes the resulting blood splatter into a dagger, and uses that blood dagger to stab his foe. But in an interview this week, producer Todd Garner told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the movie’s violence isn’t nearly as over-the-top as it is in the classic game series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyworz"&gt;“Compared to the game, we’re like Bambi,” says Garner. “We’re like a G-rated movie compared to the game. The game is just incredibly operatic in terms of the violence, and the Motion Picture Association of America would never let us do that much violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vnzO94h_Sab1FY2W-6rh-9KPuIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376688/MK_T1_0061.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9QIvyg"&gt;Fights in the &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; games are brutal, with blood often appearing following each punch, kick, throw, or weapon slice. And the series is famous for its Fatality finishing moves, where characters murder their opponents in exceedingly gruesome ways. (They often involve some kind of dismemberment.) Violence is part of playing the game, and it’s something that has only become more extreme as the series has progressed. In fact, it can be so bad that it’s even &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/id-have-these-extremely-graphic-dreams-what-its-like-t-1834611691"&gt;impacted members of the development team&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie isn’t trying to violence for violence’s sake, though, according to Garner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUEAjM"&gt;“We’re trying to make a movie where you care about the people, it’s grounded, it has a realistic tone to it, and the violence comes from the rules of the world that have been established, but you’re not just trying to make torture porn,” he says. “You’re trying to do something that is faithful to the IP, but also comes from a motivated and grounded place that is motivated by real characters that feel like they’ve lived real lives up until this moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hySmo45NrPL7PQZnecIFOtK1cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22376684/MK_T1_0099.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FjDqnr"&gt;In a separate interview, director Simon McQuoid talked about how he wanted to do right by the series by including violence, but that also allowed him to make a more authentic movie. “I just wanted to do &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; justice,” McQuoid says. “It was about studying and looking at what the fundamental ingredients are of &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat.&lt;/em&gt; What are the key strands of DNA that make this what it is?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5K2lG"&gt;“One of those, obviously, is kind of the brutality [of the series],” he says. “And what I liked about the blood aspect of that is that we could be authentic. We didn’t have to hold back on the fights.” For example, if somebody was stabbed through the head, “blood probably would burst down the back,” McQuoid notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHYmKR"&gt;McQuoid’s not just saying that hypothetically. I’ve seen the first 13 minutes of the film, which included a big, blade-filled fight scene. And one of its most memorable moments features a knife being plunged into the top of someone’s head, and yes, blood does seep from the wound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6trSdp"&gt;But while the movie could come across as overly violent, “everyone knows &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat &lt;/em&gt;is known for that and was OK sort of doing that,” McQuoid says. “It wasn’t a great surprise. It’s not like it’s a Jane Austen novel that we’re turning super violent. That would not be good.” The violence “matters for this property,” he says. “It allowed us to be authentic in a stylistic approach and [it was] also just what’s right for &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emgyiw"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie will hit theaters and HBO Max on April 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’ll start punishing group members who break its rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SGcD1yk2IjFys6qi0WAub8Mcro0=/0x0:2808x1872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68981123/fbgroups.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QMxcfI"&gt;Facebook is trying to clean up its Groups experience and limit the reach of potentially problematic users and communities. The company announced multiple changes to groups today, including plans to put users who break rules on probation, further limit the reach of civic and political groups, and require more moderation in groups that have violated Facebook’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a12u55"&gt;Group members who break Facebook’s rules will suffer various new consequences. Initially, people with repeat violations will be prevented from posting or commenting in any group for a certain period of time. A spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this time could be either seven or 30 days, depending on the number of violations and the severity of them. They also won’t be able to invite other people to any groups or create new groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilNvXr"&gt;One of the biggest changes is around members who break rules. Groups that have numerous violations will soon come with a warning label, too. Whenever a user tries to join one of these groups, they’ll receive a disclaimer that the group has violated community standards, which might dissuade them from joining. Facebook will also limit invite notifications for these groups. For existing members, the company will reduce the distribution of the group’s content, meaning it’ll be shown lower in the News Feed. (It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/7/21554349/facebook-groups-probation-violating-rules-misinformation-election"&gt;first piloted&lt;/a&gt; this functionality around the 2020 US presidential election, but it’s now making it a regular feature.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buFZgr"&gt;Finally, these violating groups’ admins and moderators will have to temporarily approve all posts whenever the group has a substantial number of members who have violated policies or were part of other groups that were removed for breaking the rules. If these admins or moderators just approve everything, even content that breaks the rules, the entire group will be taken down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bCKw0"&gt;As a broader update, Facebook started removing civic and political groups &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55842587"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, as well as newly created groups, from recommendations in the US. It’s now making that the standard worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBCNIs"&gt;Facebook has received much criticism for allowing &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/salvadorhernandez/facebook-profit-militant-extremist-groups-ads"&gt;extremist political groups&lt;/a&gt;, as well as groups that spread conspiracy theories or anti-vax rhetoric, to thrive on its platform. As one example, members of the group that plotted to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/08/gretchen-whitmer-kidnapping-plot-facebook-groups-militias-fbi/"&gt;used Facebook groups to organize&lt;/a&gt;, according to an FBI affidavit. And in the past, even its attempts to limit the reach of political groups have failed, according to &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/01/19/facebook-said-it-would-stop-pushing-users-to-join-partisan-political-groups-it-didnt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which found that political recommendations still showed up for users. (A Facebook spokesperson says this error has now been corrected.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PntBqo"&gt;The company continues to be in a game of whack-a-mole, where it attempts to squash the bad groups and members, only to see others sprout up. These new rules might dissuade some people from behaving badly or limit their time on the platform, but there’s always a chance that they just create a new account or skirt around the rules without breaking them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s midrange phones now feature fast refresh rate screens, stabilized cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69CPj9-NiG1F8ABRAFuhYmI4OH4=/0x330:4000x2997/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980752/32_galaxya52_a72_white_black_210310001526.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A72 feature quad rear-camera arrays, though the A72 includes a telephoto rather than depth-sensing camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJQJa4"&gt;At its second Unpacked event of the year, Samsung officially unveiled three of its next A-series phones: the Galaxy A52, A52 5G, and A72. While the company isn’t sharing US pricing or availability yet, it has confirmed European pricing: €349 for the A52 (about $415), €429 for the A52 5G (about $510), and €449 for the A72 ($534).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laK8jm"&gt;Key specs across the board include IP67 water and dust resistance, brighter screens with faster refresh rates, and a 64-megapixel main camera with optical image stabilization. All three models include a microSD card slot for expandable storage and will ship with a charging brick in the box — features that you won’t find in the S21-series flagships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="24r4ZA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N4Lex2"&gt;Each is built on an unspecified octa-core (dual 2.3GHz + hexa 1.8GHz) processor and will ship with Android 11 and Samsung’s One UI 3.0. Storage variants of 128GB and 256GB will be offered for all models, with RAM configurations that will vary by region. The devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;meet the hardware requirements&lt;/a&gt; to receive three generations of Android OS platform updates, and, like all recent Galaxy phones, are guaranteed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;at least four years of security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdPhNi"&gt;The Galaxy A52 and A52 5G will both feature 6.5-inch Super AMOLED screens. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278488/samsung-galaxy-a52-a72-leak-90hz-refresh-rate-screen"&gt;As rumored&lt;/a&gt;, the A52’s display will offer a 90Hz refresh rate, while the A52 5G will have a 120Hz screen. Each will feature a rear “quad” camera array, though one of those four cameras is a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The main 64-megapixel f/1.8 camera is accompanied by a 12-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide 5-megapixel macro and 32-megapixel f/2.2 selfie cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tM8wo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TFaxC9"&gt;Samsung says the A52 models feature brighter screens — up to 800 nits as compared to last year’s 600 — and 4,500mAh batteries capable of two days’ use on a single charge. And naturally, the A52 5G includes 5G connectivity, though Samsung hasn’t confirmed yet which frequencies it will support in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQP3P2"&gt;The Galaxy A72 offers a slightly larger 6.7-inch Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers the same basic rear camera array but includes an 8-megapixel f/2.4 3x telephoto camera instead of the depth sensor. The A72 is an LTE-only model; a 5G version is likely to come but Samsung hasn’t confirmed this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oVmRRQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10396033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkerI"&gt;We should find out US pricing and availability for these devices — and potentially other A-series models — in the next few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21212085/samsung-galaxy-a01-a11-a21-a51-a71-5g-mid-range-android-price-release-date"&gt;Last year’s&lt;/a&gt; A51 and A51 5G were introduced at $400 and $500, respectively, with the 5G version of the A71 coming in at $600. If this year’s models are priced similarly, these devices will be well-positioned to tempt midrange shoppers with features like fast refresh rate screens, stabilized main cameras, and IP ratings, which aren’t common in this class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvSpSx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 17th, 10:50AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; Added information about Android platform OS updates.&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right) | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. But, if you want an Echo Dot now, you can buy it for $35 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is $5 more than its lowest price yet. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information on sale for $45 (usually $60). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also selling some bundles, including a $45 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for the same price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40; right now it is on sale for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is also selling a bundle for $60 which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition plus an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Amazon is selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo for two Philips Hue bulbs&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $160&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c8b1ed4e46d21c7660ba5ae3006737b8&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wwkfpq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy an Echo Show 8 on Amazon, you will also receive a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZF1T9X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year subscription to Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $85 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;There are no active deals going on right now for the Echo Show 10, but if you just want the device itself, you can get it for its usual price of $250 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551%3Fpreselect%3D80770248%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kppkjv"&gt;There are, however, a few bundles going on that throw in an additional item alongside the Echo Show 10. At Amazon, can buy the Echo Show 10 and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FRR5V57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $40 on a one-year subscription&lt;/a&gt; to Food Network Kitchen. Additionally, the e-commerce site is offering a promotion, where you can save $100 off the price of two Echo Show 10 devices when you enter code &lt;strong&gt;SHOW102PACK &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGQIus"&gt;Both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329393970906605#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; also have a bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini HD security camera for $255.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 8 that’s 5G-ready on Verizon and other carriers is nearly half off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5o4K1c5CNAQrdSPOZFznB0CtG1I=/4x0:2296x1528/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980831/vzw.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kdyIku"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is offering the best price we’ve seen on the OnePlus 8 in the onyx black colorway. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615543-REG%2Foneplus_5011101036_8_5g_uw_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22335683%2Foneplus-8-verizon-amazon-echo-dot-clock-ea-play-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Originally $800, it’s just $450&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21220454/oneplus-8-pro-verizon-carrier-price-release-date"&gt;unlocked Verizon variant&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only version that supports UWB 5G and sub-6GHz 5G when connected to Verizon’s network. Alternatively, it works with AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s networks if you’re with either of those. This model originally sold for more than the base OnePlus 8 because of its Verizon 5G compatibility, but at this point, B&amp;amp;H’s deal knocks its price down below that of the base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWvJSD"&gt;This model has a 6.5-inch OLED screen that has a 90Hz refresh rate. It features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 865 processor, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. We’re close to OnePlus announcing its latest phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323979/oneplus-9-pro-leak-images-hasselblad-camera"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;, though we don’t know yet how much that will cost. It’s safe to assume, though, it’ll likely cost much more than this discounted phone today. And with these specs and its 5G compatibility, you might not miss out on much by opting for the OnePlus 8 instead of waiting on the new phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kRfMKi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ep6jbZ"&gt;It’s been a while since Amazon ran discounts on its latest Echo hardware, but you can get some decent price cuts today. One of its most useful devices, the Echo Dot with a built-in digital clock, is $15 off its usual price. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085M66LH1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This makes it $45&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon is a little backed up on orders, claiming to deliver in late March or early April, depending on your color preference, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1735153130507205842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is also honoring the deal&lt;/a&gt; if you prefer to not wait as long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2468nN"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;my colleague Dan Seifert’s review of the new Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which he claims have better sound quality than the previous version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="go4yG4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397064"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zRjaCpdNZS-Z545s1XVCsD1Oetc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21920671/XGP_EAPlay_HERO.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="psXZw6"&gt;If you game on Xbox One or one of the new Series X or Series S consoles, there’s still a way to get four months’ worth of Game Pass Ultimate for cheaper than usual. First, you’ll need to get a one-year subscription to EA Play, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014Q5UNH4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;which costs $30&lt;/a&gt;. When you redeem it on your console, Microsoft will automatically convert it to a four-month Game Pass Ultimate subscription (usually $60 total).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3JJfFw"&gt;Many games available through EA Play are on Game Pass now, in addition to a fleet of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325044/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-bethesda-games-list"&gt;newly added Bethesda games&lt;/a&gt; since Microsoft recently acquired the game publisher and its many studios.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OfydKphyuEnfrEBj3Y6ZnqVFCR0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980827/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_14_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Twelve months of turnips, K.K. Slider, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="RIRTH7"&gt;It took less than a year for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the Nintendo Switch’s defining games. Launching around the same time that millions of people were forced inside due to the pandemic, and with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188006/animal-crossing-new-horizons-design-interview-aya-kyogoku-hisashi-nogami"&gt;a new design philosophy meant to shake up the series&lt;/a&gt;, the game became a cultural phenomenon. It turned into a social space where millions — from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;streetwear enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22321111/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-archive-one-year-anniversary"&gt;museums&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/4/23/21233424/elijah-wood-animal-crossing-turnip-prices-stalk-market"&gt;movie stars&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21257183/animal-talking-new-horizons-elijah-wood-danny-trejo-gary-whitta-late-night-show"&gt;talk show hosts&lt;/a&gt; — could relax in a calm, quiet virtual world. As the community continued to find new and inventive ways to play, Nintendo steadily updated &lt;em&gt;New Horizons &lt;/em&gt;with new features and content. It’s gone on to sell more than 30 million copies to date — and it doesn’t look like things will slow down anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My favorite artist of 2020 was Animal Crossing’s singing dog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="K.K. Slider" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEGYTSKOVZBOXQvU31CR26jqXgI=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68980719/kksliderlede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="62ZQSp"&gt;I never play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on mute. I love hearing the grass crunching under my character’s shoes, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2020/3/22/21188355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-language-video"&gt;the cutesy language that all of the villagers speak&lt;/a&gt;, and, of course, the sound effects tied to all of the emotes, like the signature piano noise that plays right before you’re about to get messed up by a bunch of angry bees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHjULa"&gt;But what makes the game really worth listening to closely is the music — specifically K.K. Slider’s tunes. He’s the king of cool, a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies that inhabit your island. And for the kind of dreadful year that 2020 was shaping up to be when &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; released, hearing K.K. Slider’s work was a beam of positivity that took me and my apartment over completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8zDBt"&gt;If you’ve played &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; games before, then you may already know several of the songs. But despite seeing him guest DJ every night at Club LOL in &lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt; for the 3DS — my first serious foray into the franchise — the music didn’t really resonate with me then. Maybe it was the small screen or the tiny speakers. But when I hear one of K.K. Slider’s tunes in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; with my Switch docked, I want to get up and dance... or at least engage in some serious head-bobbing. And for much of last year, that deep catalog of tunes was all I was humming between sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjK2Bb"&gt;Most of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ music is comprised of acoustic, playful pop and light jazz grooves, but K.K.’s music dives more deeply into capturing different moods and genres. “K.K. Ska,” for instance, is a pop tune that can apparently be repurposed for wholesome memes. It didn’t really hit me just &lt;em&gt;how good&lt;/em&gt; this song was until I heard it attached to this very cheerful video on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ncTsuD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OfkViWKucCU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aZHtxR"&gt;If that kind of music doesn’t strike your fancy, how about something like “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5Gx1skphZw"&gt;K.K. Cruisin’&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyI106n2AvI"&gt;K.K. Groove&lt;/a&gt;,” or “&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khoe2zCjZpk"&gt;K.K. Metal&lt;/a&gt;”? The catalog of tunes runs the gamut of new and older popular genres, plus a few oddities to show off Nintendo’s music-writing chops even more. The art team clearly had fun designing the album covers, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhbU19"&gt;“&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZH33m9jfwyg"&gt;K.K. Jazz&lt;/a&gt;” cops the signature styling of a Blue Note Records jazz album — label insignia, two-toned layout, and all. Given the way &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; took off after launch, it’s no surprise people &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/4/21/21228752/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-kk-slider-redraw-challenge-music-album-covers-nintendo-switch"&gt;started drawing their own K.K. Slider-inspired album art for real music&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ky5BY-_CZMLEUtUELxT1Ti0qF48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374931/kkslidercomparo.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo isn’t subtle about its inspirations for K.K. Slider’s album art.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aENV86"&gt;Most of the songs in &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; aren’t new, but my enjoyment this time around had a lot to do with Nintendo’s methodical rollout (or withholding, depending on how you look at it) of K.K. Slider. Instead of having him immediately available to jam out, he’s struck it big as a musician and doesn’t have time for you and your island until you’ve proven it’s a happening place. It’s the end goal for the narrative of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, and it feels like a real achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oHx8De"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a crooning pup star among a bunch of normies”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ACJYlH"&gt;While you work toward that goal, you can buy different K.K. Slider songs through the Nook Stop PC located in the Resident Services building. It’s usually possible to get a new song every couple of days. And with enough time, you’ll have a sizable catalog of songs that can play from a stereo in your home or a boombox to set up outside for other villagers to listen (and sometimes hum along) to. The music even sounds different, depending on the kind of stereo you purchase. Some gadgets add crackles to make K.K.’s songs sound like they’re on vinyl, and buying the full DJ kit really adds a lot of bass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUn1OA"&gt;Nintendo could have easily let the player stream K.K. Slider tunes through the Nook Phone. Instead, it turned the game’s main musical act into something you had to work toward and pay dearly to fully experience. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="KK Slider" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OgPNX6Qq14K5LQ58prD4jwQH3Co=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22375177/kkslidergif.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6AUsiM"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; hub on &lt;a href="https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/K.K._Slider_song_list_(New_Horizons)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fandom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are 95 original compositions in the game. It’s well worth asking K.K. Slider to play one of them during his weekly visits, as you’ll get both a live acoustic performance and a bootleg for later use in a stereo at your home within the game. If you don’t want to go through that, just load some songs on YouTube. And if you really want to fall down a rabbit hole, people have contributed an endless trove of DIY covers in K.K. Slider’s vocal styling on YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLNEgM"&gt;Now that we’re at the anniversary of the launch of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, there aren’t many stones (proverbial, or otherwise) that I’ve left unturned. But whenever I do boot up the game, I’m always pleased to hear the songs that helped make my experience of living through 2020 a bit more pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="eq38P9"&gt;Unagi, maker of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/17/18080142/unagi-electric-scooter-kickstarter-price-specs"&gt;stylish electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;, is bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21352552/unagi-electric-scooter-subscription-price-cities"&gt;nascent subscription service&lt;/a&gt; to more cities. After testing out its $40-a-month service in small parts of New York City and Los Angeles, the Oakland, California-based company is expanding its service area in both cities, while also bringing it to seven new markets, including San Francisco, Austin, Seattle, Phoenix, Miami, and Nashville.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mwr8XJ"&gt;Helping fuel its growth, the company also just closed its first round of fundraising for $10.5 million, led by the Ecosystem Integrity Fund with participation from Menlo Ventures, Broadway Angels, and Gaingels, among others. Flush with cash, Unagi plans on adding more cities in the months ahead and is eyeing a launch in Europe as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJq7I7"&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment,” Unagi CEO David Hyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s partially generational. There’s a large generation of consumers that prefer access over ownership.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Unagi&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m7e6SO"&gt;Unagi first launched its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Funagiscooters.com%2Fpages%2Funagi-all-access-scooter-subscription%2F%3Fshow_sub_signup%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F17%2F22334608%2Funagi-electric-scooter-subscription-expansion-cities-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;All-Access subscription service&lt;/a&gt; last August in a few neighborhoods in New York City and LA. Hyman said the demand was “incredible,” though he declined to share any specifics figures. With the added cities, Hyman said Unagi All-Access will be available to over 30 million people — roughly one-tenth of the population of the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1UBfu"&gt;There will be some changes to the original subscription. The price is increasing from $39 to $49 a month. There’s still an initial $50 service fee, but Unagi is now requiring subscribers to commit to at least three months before canceling. Maintenance and insurance from scooter theft or damage are also included in the monthly fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PxgSY5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We understood that there are a lot of people who have fear of commitment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IuNjXw"&gt;Originally, Unagi promised to deliver the scooter to customers within 24 hours. With the expanded service area and new markets, that wait time is being increased to 72 hours for at least the first four weeks after launch. After that point, the scooters should arrive via FedEx in under 48 hours. Previously, the scooters were being hand-delivered by a courier; now, they will arrive in the mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0H3tWV"&gt;“It’s almost like a Netflix DVD mailer, but just much bigger,” Hyman said of the new packaging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FmbHN0"&gt;Those interested in subscribing to an Unagi scooter should check the company’s website to ensure they reside in the service area. Another change from the initial service is a range of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054731/unagi-electric-scooter-dual-motor-color-paint-job-customize"&gt;colorful options&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers can choose between four different colors for their scooter: “cosmic blue,” “sea salt” (white), “matte black,” and “scarlet fire.” (Hyman is an avowed Deadhead.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wHyGL"&gt;Like most electric scooters, Unagi’s vehicles are made in China. But unlike the hordes of cheap scooters you can find on Amazon, these scooters have a definite premium feel. Unagi’s Model One scooter has two electric motors, giving it slightly more power than your average Lime or Bird scooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW59Fy"&gt;Despite the addition of another motor, the scooter is still comparatively lightweight, clocking in at only 26 pounds. The scooter has three drive modes: Beginner (9-11 mph), Advanced (13-15 mph), and Professional (15-19 mph). The lithium-ion battery allows for a range of up to 15.5 miles. And Unagi uses a blend of aluminum and carbon fiber for the frame, helping save on weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLk34g"&gt;Unagi will sanitize each scooter before sending it out to customers, but subscribers are not guaranteed to get a brand-new scooter. That’s what makes this business model work, Hyman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DvKAr"&gt;Unagi isn’t the first scooter company to dip its toes into the world of subscriptions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523121/bird-electric-scooter-delivery-monthly-rental-sf-barcelona"&gt;Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21025818/lime-limepass-weekly-subscription-electric-scooters-bicycles-rental-rideables-micromobility"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt; have been experimenting with subscriptions for their shared electric scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/31/20747817/bird-electric-scooter-monthly-rental-san-francisco-bike-app-review"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. And electric bikes are jumping on the subscription bandwagon, too, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22279921/revel-ebike-subscription-nyc-price-specs"&gt;Revel in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, Dance in Berlin, and Swapfiets and VanMoof as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgFNGx"&gt;Hyman said the initial six months of All-Access has proven to him that scooter subscriptions can work on a wider level. Still, there will be other metrics to keep an eye on. “We’re convinced internally, but some things you can only prove with time. Right?” he said. “Like, how long does the scooter last? What are all the service costs to keep that scooter running over its lifetime? What does consumer retention and churn rates look like? It’s a longitudinal exercise that some things can only prove with time. But we feel like the data points we have are pretty conclusive.”&lt;/p&gt;
