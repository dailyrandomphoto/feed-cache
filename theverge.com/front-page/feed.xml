    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xcZSyZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gcqkd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tracy* kept it together &lt;/strong&gt;when her mom died in mid-March in New York. She kept it together when she came back from the funeral on an Amtrak rather than an airplane because there were no flights operating to get her home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOqtRc"&gt;It wasn’t until she went back to her job as a flight attendant and saw out of the galley window row upon row of airplanes stacked &lt;a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/03/31/pittsburgh-international-airport-parked-planes-coronavirus/"&gt;nose to tail&lt;/a&gt; with cloth covers over their engines and sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KFlkC"&gt;Tracy has been flying for over 16 years. She worked during the Great Recession, when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/07/business/07outlook.html"&gt;passenger traffic fell by 10 percent&lt;/a&gt; and forced &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airline_bankruptcies_in_the_United_States#Chapter_11"&gt;several airlines to declare bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt;. She worked during the years of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/business/us-issues-first-fine-for-tarmac-delays.html"&gt;nightmarish tarmac delays&lt;/a&gt; prior to 2010, when airlines weren’t required to taxi back to the gate to let passengers off even after delays of three or more hours. And she worked during the SARS epidemic in 2004, H1N1 in 2009, and the Ebola scare in 2014. But nothing in her training or her experience prepared her for the sight of so many airplanes from so many airlines with nowhere to go and no passengers to fly. For the first time in her entire career, she broke down and cried while on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AhM19x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This has to be the beginning of the end&lt;/em&gt;, she thought. &lt;em&gt;How are we going to recover from this?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMr9RAmc24YaM3398cKUWMoVRoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277439/4364_going_up_800.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="1UKmIC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two months earlier,&lt;/strong&gt; in January 2020, the outlook for the year was bright. Airlines had just posted their seventh consecutive year of &lt;a href="https://www.bts.gov/newsroom/2019-annual-and-4th-quarter-us-airline-financial-data"&gt;multibillion-dollar profits&lt;/a&gt; and were expected to continue doing &lt;a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/IATA-forecasts-higher-airline-profits-in-2020"&gt;just as well&lt;/a&gt;. For an industry historically defined by cycles of boom and bust, there seemed to be no storm clouds on the horizon — the economy was good, gas prices were stable, and business travel was expected to grow to a record &lt;a href="https://www.travelpulse.com/news/business-travel/gbta-forecasts-global-business-travel-spend-to-reach-16-trillion-by-2020.html"&gt;$1.6 trillion&lt;/a&gt; for the full year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVf8aH"&gt;But then the bottom fell out of commercial aviation. On March 1st, nearly 2.3 million passengers took a flight somewhere in the United States. Just 30 days later, &lt;a href="https://www.travelweekly.com/Travel-News/Airline-News/IATA-forecasts-higher-airline-profits-in-2020"&gt;that number was just over  136,000&lt;/a&gt;, a 94 percent drop against the previous year. And the number would keep falling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOf2UK"&gt;Airlines were pushed to the brink. Delta burned through &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/coronavirus-delta-air-lines-cash-burn-revenue"&gt;$60 million&lt;/a&gt; in cash a day; American Airlines, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F03%2F18%2Fcoronavirus-has-cash-rich-airlines-scrambling.aspx&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22258257%2Fflight-attendants-history-covid-pandemic-airline-industry-aviation#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 million&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/30/848704986/american-airlines-and-united-report-nearly-4-billion-in-combined-losses"&gt;United&lt;/a&gt;, $100 million. In April, Congress passed the CARES Act, which included $25 billion in loans and grants to keep payrolls full and airlines out of bankruptcy, but even that was only enough to keep the industry afloat for six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntmQK0"&gt;In October, with the COVID-19 pandemic showing no signs of abatement and Congress failing to pass an extension to the CARES Act, airline executives switched to plan B. They &lt;a href="https://airlinegeeks.com/2020/10/08/american-airlines-halts-routes-after-cares-expiration/"&gt;stopped service to smaller airports&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-havoc-forces-airlines-to-retire-iconic-planes-sooner-2020-3"&gt;retired entire fleets&lt;/a&gt; of aircraft. They took on a collective &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/01/us-airline-2-losses-expected-to-top-35-billion-in-dismal-2020-from-pandemic.html"&gt;$67 billion&lt;/a&gt; in new debt — including some creative new strategies, like mortgaging their &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-to-put-up-frequent-flier-program-for-5-billion-loan-11592227825"&gt;frequent flyer programs&lt;/a&gt;. But most of all, they tried to scratch what revenue they could out of the few people willing to travel. And there was no guarantee these drastic measures would work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUreki"&gt;“We’ve got 12 to 15 months of pain, sacrifice, and difficulty ahead,” said Scott Kirby, CEO of United Airlines, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/10/15/924225784/united-airlines-reports-1-8-billion-loss-but-looks-ahead-to-friendlier-skies"&gt;in mid-October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWGEk1"&gt;And the nation’s flight attendants would have to bear more pain, sacrifice, and difficulty than most. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm5d6I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDz8cCwApaB7HP79jc1b4yvnPjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277129/4364_mask_police.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="bBolUM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On March 17th,&lt;/strong&gt; the Department of Homeland Security designated airlines as “critical infrastructure” and &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA-Guidance-on-Essential-Critical-Infrastructure-Workers-1-20-508c.pdf"&gt;flight attendants as “essential workers.”&lt;/a&gt; This wasn’t an honorific: in the DHS’s own words, essential workers “have a special responsibility to maintain your work schedule” and ensure “continuity of functions.” And as flight attendants went back to work, they found that they were not returning to friendly skies. Just as the pandemic changed everything else about travel, it’s also turned their chief role — as the face of the airline from takeoff to landing — from a source of pride into a source of dread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgEsgO"&gt;Within weeks, &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/american-southwest-airlines-employees-test-positive-covid-19/287-f23b904a-60d0-49f5-8c45-30137c1e2891"&gt;several hundred flight attendants&lt;/a&gt; tested positive for COVID-19. By the end of April, it had claimed the lives of five. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JoEso"&gt;“Once it started going like wildfire, there was a lot of fear within the flight attendant community,” recalled Lori Lochelt, who flew for 22 years. “There was so much unknown about the virus. Could it live on metal surfaces, the seat back pockets, the tray tables?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jceThx"&gt;Despite this, most major airlines were rumored to &lt;a href="https://viewfromthewing.com/american-airlines-flight-attendants-risk-discipline-for-wearing-protective-face-masks/"&gt;actively prohibit&lt;/a&gt; flight attendants from wearing masks while on-duty, although only American Airlines went on record acknowledging such a policy. (At the time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that only people with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Surgeon_General/status/1244020292365815809"&gt;COVID symptoms&lt;/a&gt; wear a mask).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g1nP2j"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="otIDF2"&gt;“This did not make sense to us,” said Paul Hartshorn, Jr., the head of communications for the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), which represents the 27,000 US-based flight attendants at American Airlines. “Our major fight was to move the airlines towards a policy of everyone wearing some face covering in the airplane cabin. It just had to happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hp166"&gt;By &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/23/business/united-airlines-coronavirus-masks-flight-attendants/index.html"&gt;April&lt;/a&gt;, airlines allowed their cabin crews to wear masks. And &lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-06-15-united-airlines-strengthens-onboard-mask-policy-to-further-protect-passengers-and-employees-against-covid-19-spread-2646175010.html"&gt;a month&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/facecoverings"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;, they required passengers to mask up, too. Flight attendants became the mask police, which led to even more trouble — both on the ground and in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mxjITP"&gt;“At least one passenger on every flight has a mask issue,” said Connor*, a flight attendant with two years of experience. “It gets a little bit tiring to have to remind people, and when you remind them they get a little upset.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgvPrQ"&gt;Tracy agreed. “You always have a couple of jerky people. You can remove your mask when you’re eating or drinking, so you have the guy eating one sunflower seed at a time so he can keep the mask off the whole flight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YHjaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What a shitshow it was. I didn’t want to fly in this environment anymore.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C6sBQI"&gt;Sometimes, passengers get outright belligerent. In late October, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMho5p3DMoE"&gt;a viral video&lt;/a&gt; showed someone slap a flight attendant in the face when she tried to enforce the mask policy during boarding. The offender was quickly de-boarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVe7if"&gt;Other passengers make it all the way to their seats before picking a fight over masks. And although flight attendants have the law on their side, quoting federal regulations at a disobedient passenger does little to get them to actually wear a mask if they don’t want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiCq0K"&gt;Ben*, the lead attendant on a Boston-bound flight, found this out the hard way. After takeoff, one of his colleagues told him that there was a passenger on board who had taken off her mask and was refusing to wear it, despite pleas from every single one of the cabin crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvKTLx"&gt;“I’m a free American and you can’t make me,” she told them. “Stop infringing on my rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZtBqa"&gt;The best Ben could do was give the customer a so-called “yellow card,” a slip of paper first pioneered by &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/162805.stm"&gt;British Airways&lt;/a&gt; (hence the soccer reference) that warns passengers: follow crew member instructions or get banned from the airlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMLFuZ"&gt;She remained maskless for the rest of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSYH3a"&gt;The pandemic has laid bare the many ways airlines tend to leave their flight attendants out on a metaphorical island, without the tools or support to deal with the difficult situations they might face in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4eWPE"&gt;Of the 40 flight attendants who talked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, only one recalled an instance where a flight was diverted to deal with an especially unruly maskless passenger. The rest of the time, the cabin crew — and the passengers around the offender — just had to grit their teeth and endure the risks until they landed.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E88gbq"&gt;“What a shitshow it was,” said Lochelt, who took early retirement in August because of the pandemic travel conditions. “I didn’t want to fly in this environment anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0Cl4m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SidvNjYE4at1rBjVj18Put4s7wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277084/4364_business_beer.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="EZmMd1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It might seem like the job&lt;/strong&gt; has gotten a lot worse from the so-called Golden Age of travel between 1960 and 1978. Dinah Barron-Hess, who flew during the ‘70s and wrote about her experiences in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fly-Life-Aloft-Dinah-Barron-Hess-ebook/dp/B072MHHNRZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fly By: A Life Aloft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, recalled an age of “caviar, prime rib carved in the aisle, an ice cream sundae cart and every top shelf wine, champagne, and liquor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcCiEQ"&gt;“First class was truly first class,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “There were fewer people, and I had more time to be a gracious hostess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwmdpN"&gt;And more time to accrue some amazing stories. In February 1979, Barron-Hess was trying to prepare her first class section for landing when a drunken passenger blocked her way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yPsVy"&gt;“Do you need a ride into the city?” he said. “I have a limo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wtSVDX"&gt;Behind her, someone spoke up. It was a voice that was unmistakable to everyone in the cabin — in fact, it would have been unmistakable to almost everyone in America at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkjDN7"&gt;“She has a ride to the city,” said the voice, “with &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0VSTKE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Flight attendant training is 95% emergency preparation training, and 5% service training”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9QxIW4"&gt;Dressed in a dark suit, a narrow black tie, and his trademark horn-rimmed glasses was legendary actor Cary Grant. He was in his 70s at the time — but, said Barron-Hess, still incredibly handsome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDZ8kc"&gt;Awestruck, her harasser backed off. Grant, true to his word, did indeed take her into the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v84vJG"&gt;Nowadays, the inflight service is not quite so glamorous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19tz7U"&gt;“Most people don’t really realize, flight attendant training is 95% emergency preparation training, and 5% service training,” said Joe Thomas, who hosts the &lt;a href="https://groundedwithflightattendantjoe.podbean.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grounded with Flight Attendant Joe&lt;/em&gt; podcast&lt;/a&gt;. “Which is weird, because when you get on the plane, it’s the complete opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gySKQx"&gt;Still, although in-flight celebrity encounters are rare, normal passengers provide more than enough entertaining stories. Before a departure in Las Vegas, Thomas was surprised to see two passengers coming down the jetway with a third, completely limp, dangling between them with an arm around each of their shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6NUV7"&gt;“Hi guys,” he said, “is everything okay?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MkCwU"&gt;One of the men gestured to their unconscious friend. “Oh yeah,” he said. “Dan’s just a little tired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ey29C4"&gt;Thomas could smell the alcohol even from inside the airplane. Dan wasn’t just a little tired; he was flammable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wybr1x"&gt;“Sorry, fellas,” he said. “Dan isn’t going anywhere today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6iaf0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z5oYRMkQbTqeaAQWHxLyr_n1uXc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277196/7ca5c42acf5daf597b8d49fc5833fcce.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A Southwest Airlines ad from the 1970’s.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="XpvWbD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there’s one constant&lt;/strong&gt; between the age of COVID and the mythical Golden Age of flying, it’s that flight attendants have to deal with harassment on a daily basis. Nowadays, it’s much more overtly hostile. But even in the Golden Age, it was there: rampant sexism that often rose to the level of sexual assault. And in both cases, it was caused by the massive economic pressures that come with such a volatile industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uj5ssk"&gt;In the 1960s, the average flight was only &lt;a href="https://airlines.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/1968.pdf"&gt;half full&lt;/a&gt;: all of that champagne and lobster might cause the well-heeled to flock to first class, but it didn’t fill the tens of millions of empty seats in the back of the airplane. So airlines sought a competitive edge that everyone could appreciate. And they found it in their cabin crews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD2QiU"&gt;As long as there have been flight attendants, there have been overly friendly passengers, as one “air hostess” &lt;a href="https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/04/12/85301712.pdf?pdf_redirect=true&amp;amp;ip=0"&gt;told&lt;em&gt; The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1936. “It’s usually at the end of the run when we’re off duty and the man is away from home and lonesome,” she said. “If we like him we sometimes go to dinner and a show — if we aren’t already going out with the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfNF9l"&gt;But in the 1960s, airlines learned to weaponize this interest. They hired flight attendants with &lt;a href="https://clickamericana.com/topics/money-work/fly-girls-stewardess-job-requirements-of-the-50s-60s"&gt;a specific “look”&lt;/a&gt;: women no older than 27, weighing less than 135 pounds, between 5’2” and 5’7” in height, and “unencumbered” by a husband. And each airline hired for different personalities. Pan Am stewardesses were sophisticated and worldly. Braniff and Pacific Southwest, sexy and flirtatious. United wanted the “girl next door.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fZSOBw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Anyone who got engaged or pregnant could be fired on the spot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bjr3Lp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkFt5V09HzU"&gt;A TV commercial for Eastern Air Lines&lt;/a&gt; dramatized the process — but only slightly — by having a Woody Allen sound-alike dismiss a parade of young women who weren’t a fit: “She’s awkward.” “She’s married.” “She wears glasses. Honey, no.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGdxZr"&gt;Even with such strict guidelines, airlines had a wealth of applicants. In 1961, Pan Am placed a recruiting ad in a London newspaper for flight attendants. A thousand women responded: the airline hired just 17, including Betty Riegel, who flew for eight years and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Up-Air-Aboard-Glamorous-Airline/dp/147111225X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote a book&lt;/a&gt; about her experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmUZWr"&gt;She can still remember the airline’s grooming standards: hair above the collar, no necklaces or bracelets, eye shadow in regulation blue, and only one approved shade of lipstick — “Persian melon” by Revlon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUX7mx"&gt;“We were required to wear girdles,” she added. “Every month, the supervisor would get the scales out to check we hadn’t gone over our maximum weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdB63g"&gt;Above all else, flight attendants must always remain young and unattached. Anyone who got engaged or pregnant could be fired on the spot. And no matter what, your career was over &lt;a href="https://theweek.com/articles/466935/10-shocking-secrets-flight-attendants"&gt;as soon as you turned 32&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my422H"&gt;Yet, every new hire at every airline had one trait in common, as Barron-Hess found out from a drunk HR executive one evening: across the entire industry, he told her, recruiters primarily looked for “tens who think they are sixes.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEee3e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ivZMZZ8zHSgnYxeCef5no5dJuE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277599/coffeeteaormeuni00bake_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Cover of Coffee, Tea, or Me? from 1967.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="mYg7Ho"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In 1967, the airlines’&lt;/strong&gt; soft sell of their cabin crews turned harder. Two flight attendants named Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/coffeeteaormeuni00bake/page/n3/mode/2up"&gt;published a book&lt;/a&gt; that purported to be “the uninhibited memoirs of two airline stewardesses.” But mainly, it was positioned as a step-by-step guide to picking up flight attendants, who, the book assured readers, were ready and willing targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5EKea"&gt;“Good or bad, meeting men is the name of the stewardess game,” wrote Baker and Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kFxzwe"&gt;The book was a smash hit, selling &lt;a href="https://archive.org/details/coffeeteaormegir00bake"&gt;3 million copies&lt;/a&gt; and spawning three sequels — except Trudy Baker and Rachel Jones didn’t exist. The book had actually been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/obituaries/donald-bain-dead-widely-read-author-but-not-by-that-name.html?searchResultPosition=5"&gt;written by an American Airlines publicist&lt;/a&gt; named Donald Bain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmDKsm"&gt;Truthful or not, &lt;em&gt;Coffee, Tea, or Me?&lt;/em&gt; planted the image of “stewardess sexpots” in the popular imagination, and airlines were quick to capitalize on it. &lt;a href="https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-ceo/2017/may/southwest-airlines-50-year-anniversary-love-field-dallas/"&gt;Miniskirts and go-go boots&lt;/a&gt; became part of the standard uniform at Southwest Airlines. Braniff featured &lt;a href="https://www.collectorsweekly.com/articles/when-airline-fashion-was-flying-high/"&gt;designer catsuits&lt;/a&gt; in psychedelic patterns. And Trans World Airlines made its flight attendants don &lt;a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_af6xrbETC0/WJJxfytHatI/AAAAAAAABAc/osJvlHaPfMoGb_BGcpTDpq7gUebnbexTwCLcB/s1600/Taste%2Bof%2BEurope.jpg"&gt;disposable paper outfits&lt;/a&gt; in styles like “British wench,” “Roman toga,” or “Manhattan penthouse” just before meal service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E4wyLu"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pjh8HS"&gt;No one was more on the nose than National Airlines and its 1971 “Fly Me” campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFjJXFmuEqM"&gt;In one commercial&lt;/a&gt;, a bikini-clad flight attendant named Judy runs down the beach while she says in voice over, “Fly me to Houston. Or fly me to New Orleans. You can fly me morning, noon, and night. Just say when!” The campaign drove a &lt;a href="https://style.time.com/2012/08/07/virgin-americas-new-uniforms-a-75-year-history-of-fashion-in-flight/slide/national-airlines-1971/"&gt;23 percent increase in passenger bookings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMQUpd"&gt;More than a few passengers took that image a little too seriously. In her 1974 memoir &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sex_Objects_in_the_Sky/i8UgAQAAMAAJ?hl=en&amp;amp;gbpv=0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sex Objects in the Sky&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, American Airlines flight attendant Paula Kane talked about the barrage of harassment that she had to endure in the wake of &lt;em&gt;Coffee, Tea, or Me?&lt;/em&gt; — everything from “patting and pinching” to full-on sexual assault. One elderly passenger asked a colleague of Kane’s to retrieve his coat from the overhead compartment for him. When she did, he shoved his hand up her skirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58jL10"&gt;When asked what the airline was doing to stop such handsy behavior, one supervisor &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=sex+objects+in+the+sky+patting&amp;amp;tbm=bks&amp;amp;ei=rUpVX7K9KormsAWvl62oAw&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyx4OWs9XrAhUKM6wKHa9LCzUQsJ4FCAM"&gt;replied&lt;/a&gt;, “They might get a pat, but the girls are moving so fast they scarcely have time to get pinched.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xas367"&gt;Forty years later, the problem persists. A &lt;a href="https://www.afacwa.org/metoo#a6"&gt;2018 survey&lt;/a&gt; by the Association of Flight Attendants found that 68 percent of flight attendants have experienced sexual harassment at some point during their careers, and 1 in 5 have been physically assaulted on an airplane in the prior year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="5reObg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re at 36,000 feet with nowhere to go.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="d6bhWe"&gt;One passenger &lt;a href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/flight-attendants-share-their-own-sexual-harassment-stories-both-as-victims-and-offenders/"&gt;pulled a female flight attendant&lt;/a&gt; down into his lap and asked if she wanted to join the mile-high club. Another &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/travel/la-tr-travel-fly-guy-sexual-harassment-flight-attendants-20190506-story.html"&gt;slapped a flight attendant&lt;/a&gt; on the buttocks as she bent over to get a can of pop out of the drinks cart for him. Others ask flight attendants where their “&lt;a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/10/news/airline-attendant-sexual-harassment-survey/index.html"&gt;hottest layover&lt;/a&gt;” was or whether they “&lt;a href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/news/local/flight-attendants-allege-american-airlines-ignored-complaints-about-pilot/509-b77f1f4f-a47d-4504-b2a8-47f02a691d69"&gt;wanna come to my room and tie me up?&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUTuUE"&gt;For their part, flight attendants try to brush it off as just part of the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dt3wD"&gt;“You can tell that type of person,” said Tracy. “The kind of guy that would want to hit on a flight attendant is the same guy who would hit on the bartender, the waitress, anyone in that serving role. Depending on the person, they can take it too far.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ox5V8u"&gt;But flight attendants who are the victims of sexual harassment &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3234856"&gt;also experience&lt;/a&gt; higher rates of depression, anxiety, and suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0r9tDu"&gt;“We’re at 36,000 feet with nowhere to go,” a flight attendant named Teri &lt;a href="https://www.nprillinois.org/post/flight-attendants-say-they-havent-been-trained-how-deal-sexual-harassment#stream/0"&gt;told NPR in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. “So if something happens in the air, you’re forced to deal with that until you’re on the ground.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ei9f2Q"&gt;If it happens at all. This past March, the &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2020-03/Task%20Force%20Report.pdf"&gt;Department of Transportation&lt;/a&gt; released a study on in-flight sexual assault, which found that “airlines generally do not contact law enforcement every time that they learn of an in-flight sexual misconduct incident.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmMip"&gt;In that same report, the DOT asked the 12 largest US-based air carriers if they would be willing to revise their process for reporting in-flight harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cX3xS6"&gt;“Most of them responded that they would not,” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJlHCM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I became a flight attendant because&lt;/strong&gt; I wanted to travel,” said Joe Thomas. “A lot of people say, &lt;em&gt;oh, it’s because I want to give good customer service&lt;/em&gt;. But I don’t really believe that. I believe you become a flight attendant because you want to see the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcCSeK"&gt;The job itself pays a wage that is &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000"&gt;right at the national median&lt;/a&gt;. But you get free flights in your off-time and discounted hotels, cruises, rental cars, and pretty much everything else related to hospitality. On the job, you have a flexible work schedule and freedom from much direct supervision. And you get to visit a different city every day just by going to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyjskC"&gt;Betty Riegel, who worked Pan Am’s Pacific routes out of San Francisco in the 1960s, would often spend days-long layovers in places like Tahiti, Sydney, Manila, and even the occasional war zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYbuGm"&gt;“We flew Vietnam out of San Francisco,” she recalled, “and so we were landing in Saigon with the snipers’ bullets flying all around us. And staying at altitude until the last minute, and coming down almost vertically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OW2Cba"&gt;The flip side of it is missed holidays, family gatherings, and an unpredictable early career. It’s not until flight attendants accrue seniority, which can take a year at a small airline, and five or more at the legacies, that they have control over when they work and where they go. And that still doesn’t mean you’re working on the same schedule as the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EljyKY"&gt;“It’s not your usual 9 to 5. It is completely a lifestyle you have to adapt to,” said Tracy. “You really have to alter your entire existence, and if you hang on, the rewards on the tail end are worth it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSoYoI"&gt;That lifestyle is also a big reason why so many gay men turn to flying. In 2015, a &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/businessreview/2016/01/18/there-may-be-some-truth-to-the-gay-jobs-stereotype/"&gt;London School of Economics&lt;/a&gt; study found that, proportionally speaking, there are more gay men working as flight attendants than there are working as hair stylists or nurses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IhieDo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Becoming a flight attendant didn’t just change my life, it &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; my life”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Cdpswo"&gt;Flying first became a refuge for gay men in the 1950s, according to &lt;a href="https://www.k-state.edu/history/faculty-staff/tiemeyer.html"&gt;Phil Tiemeyer&lt;/a&gt;, a historian of gender and sexuality at Kansas State University. For the entire decade, federal and state governments barred gay men and women from an increasing number of careers: &lt;a href="https://www.navalhistory.org/2018/03/26/key-dates-in-u-s-military-lgbt-policy"&gt;the military&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_10450"&gt;civil service&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/lgbtqheritage/upload/lgbtqtheme-law.pdf"&gt;many professional jobs&lt;/a&gt; — teachers, doctors, lawyers, even bartenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHludd"&gt;Airlines only hired a few hundred men as cabin crew in the 1950s (and &lt;a href="https://www.colorado.edu/gendersarchive1998-2013/2007/06/01/male-stewardesses-male-flight-attendants-queer-miscarriage-justice"&gt;virtually&lt;/a&gt; none between 1960 and 1971). But a &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2013/07/gay-male-flight-attendants-in-im-so-excited-the-history-of-the-gay-steward-stereotype.html"&gt;huge proportion&lt;/a&gt; were gay — up to 90 percent, according to some former stewards. And they found, ironically, that the very policies that forced women out of the profession allowed gay men to stay in it. Male stewards didn’t have to retire upon turning 32. Marriage restrictions didn’t apply to male stewards at the time, and they obviously didn’t get pregnant, either. So while female flight attendants stayed on the job for an average of &lt;a href="https://unitedafa.org/afa/about/milestones/"&gt;18 months&lt;/a&gt;, male flight attendants accrued experience and seniority that the constant influx of female new hires couldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdIKfF"&gt;So airlines tolerated gay men in the cabin, if only to keep their most senior stewards in place. And as airlines consolidated around major hubs — San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York — the pull toward aviation became even stronger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vPkpsX"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQiwhg"&gt;As Tiemeyer described it: “You can make decent money, you can work with other gay men, you don’t have to worry about job security because the unions protect you and the companies decide to tolerate you, and you can go to all these exciting gay cities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FT3mWT"&gt;It’s a legacy that endures to this day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEtdbE"&gt;“I’m from a small town and always knew I wanted to get out and see the world,” said Rich, a flight attendant who blogs as one half of &lt;a href="http://www.twoguysonaplane.com/"&gt;twoguysonaplane.com&lt;/a&gt;. But it never seemed like he would get there. He was on food stamps, struggling to pay his rent every month. “A friend saw an ad for a flight attendant open house. They thought it would be the perfect summer job for me so I decided, why not?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Um39r6"&gt;It’s been seven years since he took a chance on air travel. In that time, he met his husband, who’s also a flight attendant, on a flight. Three years later, the two of them were married in an airplane hangar. They launched their travel blog together in Since 2017, they’ve blogged together at &lt;a href="http://www.twoguysonaplane.com/"&gt;twoguysonaplane.com&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIOHke"&gt;“As gay men, we often struggle while growing up with being labeled and feeling trapped,” he said. “Flying allows for a great deal of freedom to be exactly who you are, an opportunity which we don’t always receive as members of the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF9oAM"&gt;“Becoming a flight attendant didn’t just change my life, it &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; my life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ4BjF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UHhRQ3t-QLNIstMjyaw6iWPnBCs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277442/4364_going_down_800.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="6xOqQM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In times of crisis, though,&lt;/strong&gt; the lifestyle can keep flight attendants chained to a job whose other benefits are disappearing before their very eyes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5bBzD"&gt;In 1978, President Carter signed the &lt;a href="https://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/jetage/jetage08.cfm"&gt;Airline Deregulation Act&lt;/a&gt;, which dissolved commercial aviation’s regulated cartel and opened the industry to real competition for the first time in forty years. For consumers, this meant more flights and lower fares. By 1980, 134 new airlines were launched. Five years later, domestic capacity had increased by 50%, while the median ticket price had fallen by almost 25%. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wF8xV"&gt;But it was a classic &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/260/250422.pdf"&gt;race to the bottom&lt;/a&gt;. That kind of lost revenue was unsustainable in an industry where profit margins rarely made it to double digits. By 1988, over 100 airlines had gone out of business. Even the legacy carriers that defined the Golden Age started to disappear: Braniff and National in 1982, Pan Am and Eastern in 1991. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DsXJba"&gt;To survive, airlines cut costs to the bone. In 1980, a mid-career flight attendant working a normal schedule made about $4,200 in today’s dollars. By 1995, a flight attendant with the same seniority and same hours would earn only $2,550 — a &lt;a href="https://eml.berkeley.edu/~card/papers/airline%20labor%20earnings.pdf"&gt;40% decrease&lt;/a&gt; in pay for the same work. And all but two airlines terminated their pension plans, refusing to pay out more than &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/260/250422.pdf"&gt;$12 billion in retirement benefits&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="33Ncr3"&gt;
&lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div class="ad-placemarker-athena-mobile"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PXUsjC"&gt;Wages and benefits weren’t the only things that airlines did away with post-deregulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39ucFi"&gt;“When airlines took away things that passengers took for granted — meals, blankets, pillows — it was always the flight attendants who were left to deliver the bad news,” said aviation historian and former flight attendant Gailen David, who flew between 1988 and 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQlcD"&gt;The clientele changed, too. With the rise of the &lt;a href="https://thepointsguy.com/guide/evolution-frequent-flyer-programs/"&gt;modern frequent flyer program&lt;/a&gt; in the 1980s, a new generation of passengers — largely business travelers who had previously flown economy — now found their way into first class. It was a good way to reward flyers whose steady demand has always kept airlines afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4sMK6"&gt;But some of them had trouble acclimating to the new amenities, as Cecilia*, a flight attendant who worked first class in the 1980s, recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8sfzP"&gt;“Sir, may I offer you some hors d’oeuvres?” she asked one particular passenger at the start of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxstdo"&gt;He looked confused and pointed to the food cart. “What’s that?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL0RzW"&gt;“Sir, we have goose liver paté, smoked salmon, shrimp cocktail, and caviar.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pae6NL"&gt;“Caviar?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mtzPn"&gt;“Uh, it’s roe,” she said. Then, she clarified: “fish eggs, sir.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR93fi"&gt;He lit up. “Okay,” he said, “give me two. Make ‘em fried!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XaawDe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IDXL6SFkcX7Plo8UDdBekBqlWlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277381/4364_covid_640.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="W9wRq1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;None of aviation’s past crises,&lt;/strong&gt; however, compare to COVID-19. Not deregulation, not the 1973 oil crisis, not even September 11. To try and survive, airlines have cut schedules, &lt;a href="https://samchui.com/2020/05/10/covid-19-a-list-of-retired-aircraft/#.X4s1wdBKiUk"&gt;retired older airplanes&lt;/a&gt;, and borrowed over &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/airlines-plan-for-prolonged-coronavirus-travel-drought-11602848431"&gt;$100 billion&lt;/a&gt; in loans and Federal aid. They’ve invested in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/travel/coronavirus-airplane-cleaning.html"&gt;electrostatic sprayers and medical-grade disinfectant&lt;/a&gt;, in a bid to make people comfortable with flying again. And they’ve deployed their flight attendants not only to enforce their patchwork mask rules, but also to try and recreate some semblance of the way things used to be, even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_49kZe6VmUM"&gt;behind layers of personal protective equipment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S5ZzOQ"&gt;But most of all, they’ve looked to reduce the largest line-item on every airline’s balance sheets: wages and benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTRW3m"&gt;“The potential for layoffs in the US aviation industry is staggering,” said AFPA’s Paul Hartshorn, Jr. “It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6B40k"&gt;According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/transportation-and-material-moving/flight-attendants.htm"&gt;121,900&lt;/a&gt; flight attendants employed at the end of 2019. With the end of the &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/23/airlines-support-clean-payroll-support-extension-assuming-no-additional-strings-380180"&gt;Payroll Support Program&lt;/a&gt; in October, airlines furloughed more than &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/23/coronavirus-stimulus-gives-airlines-15-billion-to-call-back-furloughed-workers.html"&gt;1 in 4&lt;/a&gt; of them — 32,000 people over the course of three months. And there might have been even more furloughs if &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-airline-layoffs-industry-10-million-americans/"&gt;thousands more flight attendants&lt;/a&gt;, like Lori Lochelt and Joe Thomas, hadn’t taken early retirement or unpaid leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIOJzG"&gt;For Rich, the bad news arrived in mid-September. Over email, his airline informed him and hundreds of his colleagues that they would be furloughed. After he read it, he sat down on his staircase and cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RROvpR"&gt;Two days before Christmas, Congress passed a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-in-the-900-billion-covid-19-aid-bill-11608557531"&gt;$900 billion stimulus package&lt;/a&gt; that included $15 billion for airlines. They have already started to recall furloughed flight attendants, which is a condition of the stimulus package, but the process is slow. Rich has yet to receive his recall notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uczc27"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The potential for layoffs in the US aviation industry is staggering”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zUnGQt"&gt;Still, if his career has taught him anything, it’s to adjust to the circumstances, no matter what they might be. He plans to come back to flying when the jobs come back. Besides, he can’t imagine going back into the “real world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA4sgr"&gt;Even so, a recall won’t be permanent. Federal payroll aid is scheduled to last for four months, and most airlines have characterized the recalls as &lt;a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/story/careers/covid-relief-bill-airlines-roll-back-layoff-notices/"&gt;“temporary employment” only&lt;/a&gt;. Come April, those 32,000 might find themselves out of work once again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1c8WBJ"&gt;And the rollout of vaccinations worldwide won’t restore air travel by then. Although airline executives like to claim that they’re seeing a “&lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/delta-air-lines-announces-september-quarter-financial-results"&gt;slow and steady build in demand&lt;/a&gt;” or that they’re positioned to “&lt;a href="https://hub.united.com/2020-10-14-as-q3-ends-united-airlines-shifts-from-surviving-the-covid-19-crisis-to-positioning-to-lead-the-rebound-2648210545.html"&gt;lead the rebound&lt;/a&gt;,” the reality is that airline revenues are down between 70% and 80% compared to 2019, and may not reach pre-pandemic levels for two or more years. That’s just not fast enough to guarantee jobs for every flight attendant once the stimulus package expires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIKFC3"&gt;So more than a few of them are looking toward a future that may not involve flying any more. Jennifer “Jaki” Johnson, who’s been flying for six years, sees long-term changes coming to commercial aviation, even after the pandemic subsides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXuSl0"&gt;“All of these different options to have virtual conferences and meetings [will] change the face of business travel, which a lot of airlines depend on,” she said. “Airlines will have to become leaner, smaller. Travel might look so different in the future that we don’t need as many flight attendants as before.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg9Enu"&gt;She hasn’t flown since March, and now focuses on her own wellness product line, &lt;a href="https://www.jetsetterchic.com/"&gt;Jetsetter Chic&lt;/a&gt;, which just launched pandemic amenity kits — complete with hand sanitizer and masks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuH9hg"&gt;Her advice to other flight attendants is blunt, but hopeful. “Rethink a career in aviation. Look at what else you can do, because there are so many new paths going to open with technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iThNov"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jF0HF6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Name has been changed to protect the identity of those involved.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV for $1,000 is the best TV deal in 2021 so far</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQDzj_spAmtrWpqqx03JV41cUIY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762342/viziooled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJP1rL"&gt;You have another chance today to pick up Vizio’s 55-inch OLED TV at a discount. Normally $1,300 for this size, it’s down to &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260082412707165" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The best price from late 2020 was $100 cheaper than today’s deal, but if you’re scrambling for a decent price cut in time for the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 7th, your search might end here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6z5BDu"&gt;This model is Vizio’s debut OLED television, launching alongside a larger 65-inch version that currently &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260096336715183" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;costs $1,500&lt;/a&gt; (down from $2,000) at Best Buy. Other than having excellent picture quality and contrast, thanks to its OLED screen tech, it’s going to be a good choice for people with either a fast gaming PC with a recent Nvidia graphics card, a PS5, an Xbox Series X, or all of the above. That’s because it has HDMI 2.1 ports that can display 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second, which will allow your machines to churn out high-end visuals at a fast frame rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ibEfH3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="utlphW"&gt;If you want a larger 65-inch Vizio TV with similar gaming chops, but you don’t need it to be an OLED panel, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260223954464612" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vizio’s 65-inch P-Series Quantum QLED TV is $920&lt;/a&gt;, or $900 if you sign in with your Best Buy account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8xLUcW"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Galaxy Buds Live review: good beans, no compromises|76973" data-volume-uuid="2f0898dea" data-volume-id="76973" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-271" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LwiDvf"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live wireless earbuds have been succeeded, in a way, by the Galaxy Buds Pro, and we’re now seeing their price plummet. If you’re willing to give a refurbished set a try, Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731260495850956119" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling the black colorway for just $60&lt;/a&gt; (down from around $139 in new condition). These are cleaned and inspected, and Best Buy assures that all original accessories are included with each set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IN8K8X"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad mini 2019 review: the best small tablet|63300" data-volume-uuid="e735355f0" data-volume-id="63300" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-808" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bJSDOk"&gt;Apple’s latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; tablet that launched in 2019 has hit its lowest price yet. The 64GB Wi-Fi version is $335 at Amazon (down from $399). It didn’t take long after launch before we saw $50 price cuts on this particular model, so this isn’t a huge departure from what we’ve seen before. But if you’re browsing for a small 7.9-inch iPad, this is the one to get. It features Apple’s A12 Bionic processor, and it has a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood celebrates amateur investors in awkwardly timed Super Bowl ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3vH_fU9xafVBdR0i8f0lmsn98Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68762124/acastro_210201_1777_robinhood_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FPPPKG"&gt;Robinhood is running its first Super Bowl ad, just as the company faces a growing brand crisis. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/robinhood-will-run-super-bowl-ad-as-brand-crisis-mounts.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the commercial marks Robinhood’s biggest brand campaign, and it focuses on the idea that anyone can be an investor. That’s been at the center of Robinhood’s message since it was founded seven years ago, but recent stock restrictions have undermined Robinhood’s entire brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee6o6Q"&gt;Robinhood temporarily banned small investors from buying stock in companies like GameStop last week, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256419/robinhood-limits-wall-street-bets-stock-buys"&gt;placing restrictions on stocks&lt;/a&gt; associated with r/WallStreetBets — including GameStop, AMC, and Nokia. The move angered thousands of Robinhood customers trying to buy stocks, and the company’s app got review-bombed on the Google Play Store. While Google initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;tried to salvage&lt;/a&gt; the app’s rating, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261178/robinhood-google-play-store-app-rating-one-star-reviews-stocks-gamestop-reddit"&gt;plummeted back down&lt;/a&gt; to just one star yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxDYOH"&gt;Robinhood is also facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22254656/robinhood-gamestop-stonks-trade-freeze-class-action-lawsuits"&gt;dozens of lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the GameStop stock freeze, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254584/gamestop-robinhood-short-reddit-wallstreetbets-aoc-ted-cruz"&gt;called on Congress to investigate&lt;/a&gt; the Robinhood app. &lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week"&gt;Robinhood claims&lt;/a&gt; the restrictions were put in place due to clearinghouses suddenly requiring much higher deposits, but the company hasn’t specifically explained the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;cryptocurrency restrictions&lt;/a&gt; it also put in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xhofl"&gt;This new Super Bowl commercial doesn’t address any of the controversy around Robinhood right now, making it rather awkwardly timed. CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports that Robinhood’s chief marketing officer, Christina Smedley, says the ad is designed to let people know more about the app. “It felt like this was a great stage for us to remind people about what we stand for and remind people about why the company was put into existence in the first place,” says Smedley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkzTQK"&gt;Robinhood has disabled comments on the YouTube version of the commercial, but a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RobinhoodApp/status/1356950742112768002"&gt;version on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; is already seeing negative responses to this new Super Bowl ad.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OneDrive for Android now supports Samsung Motion Photos and 8K video playback</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SQxUfRO3NOpoqtWderua_Ucd5c=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761927/Microsoft_OneDrive.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CYR4zb"&gt;Microsoft is updating its OneDrive app for Android this week with a new home screen, Samsung Motion Photos support, and the ability to play 8K videos. The new home screen includes quick access to recent files, offline files, and the “On This Day” feature of OneDrive that reminds you of your old photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rNacd"&gt;Samsung Motion Photos support is also included in this update, allowing owners of Samsung phones to play back photos captured with motion in the OneDrive app or online. These photos work like Apple’s Live Photos and capture a still image alongside several seconds of video and sound before the capture. Microsoft says Samsung Motion Photos playback is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/onedrive-for-android-updates/ba-p/1953515"&gt;rolling out worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and will require Android version 6 or above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZEDf_ZxRAXXb4kBANmkaypzuB-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278175/onedriveandroid.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OneDrive’s new home screen on Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ryix81"&gt;The final addition is 8K video playback for compatible Samsung phones like the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt; or last year’s S20. While you’ve always been able to store 8K videos on OneDrive, the service now supports playback on compatible screens and devices. This could tempt more to store 8K video on Microsoft’s cloud storage service, particularly when OneDrive now supports &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231123/microsoft-file-upload-limit-250gb-onedrive-teams-sharepoint"&gt;up to 250GB files&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEepet"&gt;This latest Android update for OneDrive focuses a lot on Samsung’s phones and is an example of the ongoing partnership between Microsoft Samsung. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;Both companies&lt;/a&gt; are working on a variety of ways to integrate Microsoft’s software and services into Samsung Android phones, and there’s even a partnership for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134167/microsoft-samsung-xbox-partnership-xcloud-cloud-game-streaming"&gt;cloud gaming through xCloud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Budden is bringing his podcast to Patreon </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="REVOLT X AT&amp;amp;amp;T Host REVOLT 3-Day Summit In Los Angeles - Day 1" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RLF8vAy9-qnbUkaN8C3DZY5DHjw=/0x0:4824x3216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761788/1183514261.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phillip Faraone / Getty Images for Revolt&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7FjAY0"&gt;Four months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;ending his exclusive Spotify deal&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Budden is bringing his podcast &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/joebudden"&gt;to Patreon&lt;/a&gt; and has been made an adviser to the company, taking on the title head of creator equity. Like many other podcasters on Patreon, his show will be available freely on most podcasting platforms — with the notable exception of Spotify — and paying supporters will have access to additional perks. Both his show, &lt;em&gt;The Joe Budden Podcast&lt;/em&gt;, and his network, The Joe Budden Network, will be supported through the same Patreon page with the same subscription cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEcL3X"&gt;Subscribers can pay between $5 and $25 a month for bonus content, a private Discord, and exclusive tour deals. Budden tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he and his team will also gate new shows as exclusives for Patreon subscribers, with them possibly being released more widely after a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmmhPA"&gt;The message from this move is clear: although many podcasters are committing to exclusive deals, Budden doesn’t see them as the future of podcasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y7a4J"&gt;“That is so prehistoric,” he says, explaining that when he signed his Spotify deal three years ago, he and Spotify both wanted to see if exclusive deals could work. He says he proved the model, along with the potential of his audience, but didn’t want Spotify to use his fans and reach to prove the platform’s own worth and make money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K8a6EO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Subscription tiers range from $5 to $25 per month&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iS3H5A"&gt;“For many years, the record labels and the system that I come from tricked us into thinking they were doing us a favor by capitalizing off our talent and basically loaning us money, and that’s been the standard the entire time,” Budden says, adding that he already knows how that system worked out for creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3ugww"&gt;When Budden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403282/joe-budden-spotify-exclusive-leaving-host-podcast"&gt;announced his split&lt;/a&gt; from the tech company, he said Spotify was “pillaging” his audience and only cared about how his show contributed to Spotify overall, not about his actual podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlSV21"&gt;Jack Conte, the CEO of Patreon, says Budden is on a standard Patreon plan, where the company takes a cut of his subscription revenue, but having him as an adviser sets him apart from other creators and emphasizes the company’s interest in hearing from him directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBb08l"&gt;“This is about tech companies paying creators the minimum amount that they can get away with instead of paying creators what they’re actually worth,” Conte says. “Creators are uploading gold to these platforms — billions of hours of energy, and enthusiasm, and passion, and creativity, and storytelling, and excitement — all the stuff that we love to read, and listen to, and watch, and see and hear, and creators are getting paid fractions of what they’re actually worth. And not only that, they’re disconnected from their audiences. They don’t own the relationship with their audience. They don’t get data. They don’t get to run their own business. They get locked out of their business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hd5oLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Budden is being made the head of creator equity at Patreon as part of the deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3NMRFv"&gt;Budden’s not the only one to have spoken out about how Spotify treats creators. The hosts of &lt;em&gt;The Nod,&lt;/em&gt; which became a Spotify-owned show after the company acquired Gimlet Media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308074/the-nod-spotify-rss-feed-another-round-buzzfeed-podcast-ownership"&gt;spoke out&lt;/a&gt; in June about their issues with show ownership. The hosts, Brittany Luse and Eric Eddings, say they built their show and audience but owned none of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMPg3i"&gt;“At the end of the day, investing in someone’s talent isn’t the same as having the talent yourself,” Luse told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s very strange that [Spotify and Gimlet] are the only people who can claim ownership over [&lt;em&gt;The Nod&lt;/em&gt; and its segments].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0S7Ot"&gt;Still, Spotify has continued to sign deals with big-name talent, including Michelle Obama, Kim Kardashian West, Meghan Markle, and Prince Harry. It’s also continued to encourage small creators to try podcasting through its creation software, Anchor. Patreon is setting itself up as the antithesis to exclusives — a place where podcasters can reward their most loyal fans while also benefiting from the freedom to do whatever they want with their show.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok will now warn you about videos with questionable information</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mOdqMYYpzMY2NH_nJv8cFLCPOB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761761/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xHW5sb"&gt;TikTok will start displaying warnings on videos that contain questionable information that couldn’t be verified by fact-checkers, and it’ll begin warning users when they go to re-share those videos that the information hasn’t been confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1yeuL"&gt;The app will now display a warning label on these videos that reads, “Caution: Video flagged for unverified content.” This means a fact-checker looked at the content but wasn’t able to certify that it was right or wrong. TikTok has already been reducing the spread of some unverified videos, but they weren’t publicly flagged before today. Creators will now get a message when a warning label is added to their video, and those videos will all have their distribution reduced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0MoqtsXkRLKRLgz3R5uT1y7aQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22277165/New_prompts_to_consider_before_sharing.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qv2zdj"&gt;Viewers will also be warned when they go to re-share a video that has a warning label on it. After clicking the share button, which lets you post a video outside the app, a pop-up will ask if you’re “sure you want to share this video?” You can still share the video if you want to, but the prompt seems to be designed to dissuade some people from following through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RefQqK"&gt;TikTok didn’t say how many videos it looks at each day for fact-checking or how it chooses which videos to review. A spokesperson said that fact-checking is often focused on topics like elections, vaccines, and climate change and that a video doesn’t have to reach a certain popularity to qualify for review. Videos that violate TikTok’s misinformation policy will be removed outright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RY0oo"&gt;Other social apps have tried similar warnings over the past year to limit the spread of misinformation. Facebook warns you before you share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21365305/facebook-covid-19-warning-notification-post-misinformation"&gt;stories about COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21304173/facebook-old-news-articles-warning-notification-time"&gt;articles that may be out of date&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter will warn you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611927/twitter-show-warning-like-labeled-tweet"&gt;before retweeting potential misinformation&lt;/a&gt;, and on a much funnier note, will also suggest that you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455635/twitter-read-before-you-tweet-article-prompt-rolling-out-globally-soon"&gt;open and read through a news story&lt;/a&gt; before you repost it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify subscribers surge past 150 million</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aUS9Dz"&gt;Spotify now boasts 155 million premium subscribers and 345 million monthly active users, according to its &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Fourth-Quarter-2020/default.aspx"&gt;latest earnings report released today&lt;/a&gt;. Those numbers represent a 24 percent and 27 percent year-over year increase. Its biggest increase was in ad-supported monthly active users, which rose 30 percent to 199 million. &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-10-29/spotify-reports-third-quarter-2020-earnings/"&gt;Last quarter&lt;/a&gt;, it reported having reached 144 million subscribers, and 320 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOoCJE"&gt;However, despite the growth in listeners, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-with-focus-on-podcasts-11612350000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that the average revenue per user fell by 8 percent to €4.26 (around $5.13) compared to a year ago. That’s because of the discounted plans used to lure in new subscribers, and the lower prices it charges in markets like Russia and India. Ad revenue was up, however, accounting for 13 percent of revenue despite historically bringing in less than 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHzt5xeRsDYXJWtgJry9747l42k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278130/Header_Gif.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify now has 345 million monthly active users.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xWIlm3"&gt;Overall Spotify still made a loss of €125 million, but that’s down from the €209 million loss it made the year before. It’s rare for Spotify to post a profit as the company continues to invest in growth, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sREQZL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spotify continues to sign big names for its podcast business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iA0HB"&gt;The earnings announcement comes as Spotify continues to make big investments outside of music, the service’s traditional strength. It recently made moves into audiobooks, experimenting with offering recordings of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;celebrities reading public domain books&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYOV0p"&gt;Spotify is also investing heavily in podcast. This quarter, the company continued to sign big names for its podcast business like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176014/prince-harry-meghan-markle-podcast-spotify-exclusive-archewell-audio"&gt;Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242381/ava-duvernay-spotify-podcast-audio-deal-exclusive"&gt;Ava Duvernay&lt;/a&gt;. It now offers more than 2.2 million podcasts through its service, with podcast consumption up nearly 100 percent compared to the same time a year ago. Spotify says that 25 percent of its users engaged with podcast content during the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5FqMxN"&gt;Spotify has argued that its investment in podcasts in particular increases usage, engagement, and customer retention, and present an opportunity for it to decrease its reliance on licensing music from labels. Spotify reiterated that belief in today’s earnings release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UADCmc"&gt;However, some analysts say the investment in podcasts has yet to meaningfully pay off, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/15/spotifys-big-bet-on-podcasts-is-failing-citi-says.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBNC&lt;/em&gt; recently reported&lt;/a&gt;. Writing in an investor note, analysts at Citi said that “to date, we have not seen a material positive inflection in app downloads or Premium subscriptions” as a result of Spotify’s podcast investments. Last year, reports indicated that Spotify was exploring the possibility of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552822/spotify-podcast-subscription-service-survey"&gt;subscription podcast service&lt;/a&gt;, opening up another source of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K1wYY"&gt;This earnings report won’t be Spotify’s last major announcement of the month. Yesterday the company teased a “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1356648594460315648"&gt;Stream On&lt;/a&gt;” event taking place on February 22nd. In today’s release, the company said it will use the event “to share the latest on the state of global audio streaming and where it’s headed in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poly’s new monitor has a built-in mic, camera, and even lighting for video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bUvUYO2YSHBpz7oVr5eR5w-dMG8=/0x0:1613x1075/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761456/Studio_P21_In_call_Lifestyle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poly’s P21 display has a built in webcam, microphone, speakers, and lighting.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Poly&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mN7yuw"&gt;Poly, the &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;brand launched&lt;/a&gt; after headset-manufacturer Plantronics bought video conferencing company Polycom &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/02/1532616/0/en/Plantronics-Completes-Acquisition-of-Polycom.html"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, is announcing a new lineup of office gear for the work-from-home era. There’s the $129 Poly Studio P5 webcam, the $599 Poly Studio P15 Personal Video Bar, and the $815 Poly Studio P21 Personal Meeting Display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnaohW"&gt;The P21 display is particularly interesting. Although it’s fundamentally a 21-inch monitor, it’s designed to make the most of video calls. It’s got a built in webcam with a physical privacy shutter, microphone, and integrated stereo speakers. There’s even a pair of ambient lights on its left and right sides to keep your face well-illuminated on video calls. Its stand doubles as a wireless charger, and there are video call shortcut buttons along the bottom of the screen, including one to quickly mute your microphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca12Eu"&gt;There’s no mention of the monitor’s resolution or panel type &lt;a href="https://www.poly.com/us/en/products/video-conferencing/studio-p/studio-p21?utm_medium=media&amp;amp;utm_source=press_release&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GL-PS-FY21Q4-OzProductLaunch%E2%80%94EN&amp;amp;cnid=7013t000001l3I1"&gt;on its product page&lt;/a&gt;, and Poly is specifically pitching it as a “second or backup display” despite advertising it as “pro-grade.” So suffice it to say, this probably isn’t going to replace your main monitor anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ex7nMzlL-D3HysGKaeuo0NASNSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278097/Studio_P15_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poly P15 Personal Video Bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jzZA0mm_B0RunKBQ4b_n1VVVRX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22278098/Studio_P5_Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Poly Studio P5 webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMJJmE"&gt;The P15 Personal Video Bar is a 4K webcam (capable of automatically keeping you in frame) with a built-in speaker and microphone. Then there’s the Poly Studio P5, a 1080p webcam with up to 4x digital zoom, and a built in USB Type-A connector that lets you plug a headsets’ wireless receiver directly into the back of the camera. Both cameras have built-in privacy shutters. It’s also selling bundles of its Studio P5 webcam with an included headset or speakerphone, starting at $149.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjYOdC"&gt;Poly has been in the video conferencing business for a while, first as Polycom, and as Poly since &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-plantronics-poly-polycom.html"&gt;its 2019 rebrand&lt;/a&gt;. Its latest product launch follows a huge increase in the amount of people working from home which is expected to continue long after the immediate health dangers of the pandemic pass. The last year has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21199521/webcam-shortage-price-raise-logitech-razer-amazon-best-buy-ebay"&gt;seen webcam shortages&lt;/a&gt; as people upgraded their home video calling setups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aedALW"&gt;All three new products will be available beginning in April, Poly says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HX1KA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqiwUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony sold 4.5 million PlayStation 5 consoles last year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j5AZ__pvMlw_E9osPwEfPdXr1Vs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761261/vpavic_4278_20201030_0301.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gxWfOb"&gt;Sony shipped 4.5 million PlayStation 5 units worldwide in 2020, as revealed by information &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/20q3_supplement.pdf"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; alongside the company’s latest earnings report. The number highlights Sony’s current ability to mass-produce the console, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;extremely difficult to buy&lt;/a&gt; since its launch in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZv49A"&gt;Demand for the PlayStation 4 dropped dramatically year-on-year, with 1.4 million units shipped in the October-December quarter — a 77 percent decrease from the previous year. Sony actually managed to sell fewer PS4s in the holiday quarter than it did from July to September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lglW5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best quarter in PlayStation history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VI9X02"&gt;Sony’s gaming business overall performed much better than a year ago, with analyst Daniel Ahmad &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1356860649402425344"&gt;noting&lt;/a&gt; that it was actually the best quarter in PlayStation history. Revenue increased 40 percent to 883.2 billion yen ($8.4 billion), partly driven by PS5 sales. Operating profit was up by 50 percent to 80.2 billion yen ($763.3 million) because of higher game sales, PlayStation Plus subscriptions, and better margins on PS4 hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2H7Fd"&gt;Sony does note, however, that expenses related to the PS5 launch offset some of its profit gains, and also confirms that the PS5 hardware itself is being sold for less than it costs to make. A loss was incurred due to “strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than the manufacturing costs,” the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZV4S3"&gt;There’s not much to read into PS5 sales numbers until people who want to buy one are actually able to do so. But at the very least, the console’s launch seems to be broadly comparable in size to the PS4’s; the PS4 also shipped 4.5 million units in its launch quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj8lNK"&gt;Microsoft didn’t release specific sales figures for the Xbox Series X or Series S with its earnings report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250826/microsoft-q2-2021-earnings-revenue-xbox-cloud-services-surface-gaming"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, but the company did say that Xbox hardware revenue was up 86 percent year-on-year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s next folding phone is coming on February 22nd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkhnGnxiwkQIkLnmrqkWocgmnoU=/0x0:690x460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68761147/matex2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KEqkw4"&gt;Huawei will announce a new flagship foldable phone later this month, according to a &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/K0bsQcYma"&gt;Weibo post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s official page. Based on the name, the Mate X2 sounds like it should be a more substantial followup to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18238269/huawei-foldable-phone-mate-x-price-release-date-specs-mwc-2019"&gt;original Mate X&lt;/a&gt; than Huawei’s last foldable phone, the faster and slightly tweaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lFCft"&gt;Unless Huawei is being deliberately cryptic, the teaser image for the Mate X2 actually suggests that the phone could possibly switch to a different folding screen design with the flexible panel on the inside, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold line&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Mate X phones had a single panel that wrapped around the outside when closed, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22149866/royole-flexpai-2-hands-on-folding-phone"&gt;Royole’s Flexpai devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzTHsP"&gt;Otherwise, there’s not much in the way of details on the Mate X2 yet. It’s likely that it’ll have the same Kirin 9000 processor found in the Mate 40 Pro, and of course Huawei probably still won’t be able to include Google apps and services on board, limiting the device’s viability outside of China unless something changes unexpectedly quickly with the new Biden administration’s approach to sanctions. Huawei’s hardware is always worth paying attention to, though, so stay tuned for more news and details on February 22nd. &lt;/p&gt;
