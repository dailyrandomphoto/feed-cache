    <title>The ACLU is suing for more information about the FBI’s phone-hacking lab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4wNRkrtmqPhSWfHDOeKkSJXnty8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572501/acastro_180109_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BGKIVx"&gt;On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a new lawsuit demanding information about the FBI’s Electronic Device Analysis Unit (EDAU) — a forensic unit that the ACLU believes has been quietly breaking the iPhone’s local encryption systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFP3QN"&gt;“The FBI is secretly breaking the encryption that secures our cell phones and laptops from identity thieves, hackers, and abusive governments,” the ACLU said &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/the-fbi-is-secretly-breaking-into-encrypted-devices-were-suing/"&gt;in a statement announcing the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, “and it refuses to even acknowledge that it has information about these efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdnXlh"&gt;The FBI has made few public statements about the EDAU, but the lawsuit cites a handful of cases in which prosecutors have submitted a “Mobile Device Unlock Request” and received data from a previously locked phone. The EDAU also put in public requests for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/9/17550970/apple-ios-usb-restricted-mode-iphone-passcode-cracking-bypassed-usb-accessory"&gt;the GrayKey devices&lt;/a&gt; that found success unlocking a previous version of iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsSWeJ"&gt;In June 2018, the ACLU filed a FOIA request for records relating to the EDAU, but the FBI has refused to confirm any records even exist. After a string of appeals within the FOIA process, the group is &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief?redirect=aclu-v-department-justice-complaint-injunctive-relief"&gt;taking the issue to federal court&lt;/a&gt;, calling on the attorney general and FBI inspector general to directly intervene and make the records available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HVt4V"&gt;“We’re demanding the government release records concerning any policies applicable to the EDAU, its technological capabilities to unlock or access electronic devices, and its requests for, purchases of, or uses of software that could enable it to bypass encryption,” the ACLU said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDW8TM"&gt;For years, Apple has promoted its iOS disk encryption as a powerful protection against identity theft and unauthorized access — a crucial reassurance as more and more sensitive data is routed through our phones. Apple’s insistence on robust data security has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/12/10749806/encryption-debate-fbi-terrorism-going-dark"&gt;brought it into conflict with the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, which has repeatedly pressured the company to build a backdoor into its system, most notably in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/29/11325030/apple-fbi-iphone-hack-security-encryption-what-comes-next"&gt;the San Bernardino case&lt;/a&gt;. The FBI’s current capability to break iOS encryption remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom may launch an email service and calendar app to compete with Google and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rrtrlNpAmcag-yDlGK1rDKNV5JE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68572093/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EXWZEp"&gt;Videoconferencing platform Zoom has had a blockbuster year, with its stock price rising more than 500 percent due to the unprecedented surge in remote work brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. But now the company is looking to expand beyond workplace video chat and into new territories, specifically email and calendar services, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/buoyed-by-video-success-zoom-explores-email-calendar-services"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEo54i"&gt;The company is already working on the email product, which the report states will be a web email service Zoom may begin testing as early as next year. The calendar app appears farther off and it’s unclear if development has even started. But both ideas are smart avenues for Zoom to explore, especially if companies start bringing employees back to the office and reliance on videoconferencing declines as COVID-19 vaccine distribution picks up through 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZwfDI"&gt;Many of Zoom’s major competitors are videoconferencing platforms bundled as part of broader enterprise app suites, with the two biggest ones belonging to Microsoft with its Office 365 platform and Google with its competing Workspace bundle. Both of those platforms offer calendar, email, and videoconferencing products, so it makes sense Zoom would look to email and calendar to try to round out its offerings and make Zoom less of single-purpose platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvOcYe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;report has a number of other telling signs the company is interested in building a full enterprise app suite, including job postings for “exciting chat features” and its existing integrations with other apps like Asana and Dropbox. But there is always the possibility the company decides to wait and see how the shift back to office work affects businesses and whether remote work remains a prominent factor of life well into the future. Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The CDC says the top global health story of 2020 was mosquitoes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anopheles Stephensi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbxjUN9fSM8tqEyvLbODICnOxxA=/18x0:5283x3510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571975/938660572.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iMnYNX"&gt;Like they do every December, websites across the internet are rounding up their best posts and stories from the year. That includes the website for the Center for Global Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which highlighted its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/globalhealth/newsletter/2020/december-21-2020.html"&gt;top five stories&lt;/a&gt; for 2020. And coming in at the number one spot, the health agency picked... mosquitoes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGAFF8"&gt;Specifically, it picked its recognition of World Mosquito Day, where the center called attention to a mosquito species called &lt;em&gt;Anopheles stephensi&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which spreads malaria. It’s certainly an interesting choice, considering the CDC spent the year battling a global pandemic. Not to knock mosquitoes! They’re very important, and they’re very deadly. But COVID-19 didn’t even make the number two slot — it clocked in at number three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OV58bc"&gt;Infectious disease and global health experts on Twitter found it interesting, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K7PLlL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Oh my goodness. Did a mosquito write this list?&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Michaud (@joshmich) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/joshmich/status/1341505174540574722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="tQuN7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;"#1:  The Spread of Anopheles stephensi and the Fight Against the World’s Deadliest Animal"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cdc?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CDC&lt;/a&gt; surprising choice&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;December 21, 2020: Top 5 Global Health Stories of 2020 &lt;a href="https://t.co/rCHa3wiWmw"&gt;https://t.co/rCHa3wiWmw&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDCgov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CDCgov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Sax (@PaulSaxMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PaulSaxMD/status/1341567501054976000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNu2A8"&gt;The Center for Global Health didn’t say what its methodology was for this ranking, so we can’t be sure how the list ended up ranked the way it did. The CDC could be tracking page views. Or maybe it’s a sign of self awareness from the agency, which made a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/cdc-coronavirus.html"&gt;number of missteps&lt;/a&gt; stateside that contributed to the horrible US response to the pandemic. Maybe the people building the list were just sick of COVID-19. No clear answers here. But congrats to the mosquitoes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government blacklisted DJI drones, but some drone companies are more confused than worried</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3gvZpD7rPkqUKZddwxa000Q-nyk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571797/vpavic_042029_4003_0144.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ydf6LW"&gt;Last week, the US Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put Chinese drone maker DJI&lt;/a&gt; on its Entity List, limiting how it can work with US companies. The news startled DJI’s huge American user base, including companies that rely on DJI for entire fleets of commercial drones. But it’s likely less onerous than it initially sounded — even if, like many Trump administration decisions, it comes with a dose of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78UycQ"&gt;The Trump administration has repeatedly used sanctions to crack down on Chinese tech giants, sometimes on nebulous or disputed grounds. It banned US companies from dealing with Huawei and ZTE, and it’s pursued confusing, legally ambiguous bans on the Chinese social apps WeChat and TikTok. While the Entity List is primarily meant for restricting companies that threaten national security, DJI is being censured for enabling “wide-scale human rights abuses within China,” following reports that it &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-03-26/dji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price?srnd=economics-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;provided surveillance drones&lt;/a&gt; for Chinese detention camps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z7LQYr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banning DJI would devastate the US drone industry — but that’s seemingly not happening&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VV5wwD"&gt;Completely banning DJI drones would be a catastrophic blow to the industry — but early indications suggest that’s not happening. DJI dominates hobbyist and commercial small drone sales, thanks to its comparatively low prices, sophisticated designs, and early entry to the market. “It’s the equivalent of taking Apple out of the smartphone game,” says Daniel Windham, a geographic information system (GIS) specialist who works with DJI drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyOtiy"&gt;After the announcement, however, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22190097/dji-blacklist-ban-xinjiang-entity-list-trump"&gt;DJI asserted&lt;/a&gt; that Americans could still buy its products. “DJI is disappointed in the US Department of Commerce’s decision. Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the company said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1yctf"&gt;That tallies with other companies’ interpretation of the order. “The challenge with the order has been just figuring it out,” says Mike Winn, CEO of drone data analysis company DroneDeploy. “Our understanding, after talking to lots of experts and lawyers, is that US companies are restricted from exporting US technologies.” Companies can get around this by applying for a license — something that has allowed Intel, for instance, to &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/intel-huawei/intel-gets-u-s-licences-to-supply-some-products-to-huawei-idUSKCN26D0I3"&gt;continue working&lt;/a&gt; with Huawei. “I think in the short term, we don’t see a big problem here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="itZgnB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“At this point, we simply don’t have enough data.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QISYvZ"&gt;Limiting engagement with DJI could still cause trouble for companies that sell components to the company, and it could force DJI to adapt its supply chain. But for people buying, using, and reselling the drones, it would be less of a problem. “Often, this type of order restricts a foreign company from purchasing US products. If that is the case, there would be zero impact,” says Kerry Garrison, general manager of drone vendor Multicopter Warehouse. Garrison notes that the federal government had already placed restrictions on buying the Chinese-made drones, although it could cause larger problems if the government bans using federal grants to buy them. “At this time, we simply don’t have enough data yet to really know for sure what this will all amount to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49Zkpt"&gt;The Trump administration announced its ban just a month before President-elect Joe Biden is set to take office, and it’s unclear what tack Biden will take toward the drone maker. But Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, believes there’s not much political appetite for loosening restrictions on China. “Any of these actions that they would reverse would have a political cost,” Chorzempa says. And since DJI isn’t accused of violating a concrete sanctions rule or creating a specific technical vulnerability, there’s not a simple fix for getting taken off the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shoq97"&gt;Even if the ban stands, though, DJI’s business may be unusually well-structured to withstand cutoffs. “While I’m sure there’s going to be some changes for DJI, they are a very highly vertically integrated company and they produce a lot of their own hardware,” says Winn. DJI’s drones benefit immensely from US-made software applications, but these are built on top of DJI’s own software development kit. It’s not tied to an American-made operating system the way that phone maker Huawei depended on Google — a dependence that has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;locked phone buyers out&lt;/a&gt; of popular Android apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QD11Oa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rivals have still called to “think twice” about using DJI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TaTneO"&gt;Some competitors have nonetheless hailed the DJI ban as an opportunity. The decision “sends an unmistakable signal to the marketplace: companies should think twice about doing business with a known violator of human rights,” said Brendan Groves, the policy head at rival drone company Skydio. Similarly, open-source drone platform Auterion argued that the blacklisting would make “every transaction” with DJI a legal risk, pushing businesses toward US-made alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRgqpO"&gt;But Winn doesn’t think DJI will be supplanted anytime soon. “We think it’s very exciting that there are more options. But the reality is that DJI has about 75 percent market share.” If it were truly shut out of the American market, it would leave a “big, big hole” to fill. “We don’t yet know of a company that could do that,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 review: powerful portable gaming</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A great gaming rig and an okay laptop&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hARC30"&gt;If you’re looking for the absolute most powerful gaming hardware out there... well, you don’t want the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15. You want a desktop or a laptop that weighs seven pounds, requires multiple power bricks, and is basically a desktop. But if you still want something you can realistically carry around, the Strix is about as powerful as it gets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Cwetf"&gt;We’ve reviewed a number of Asus laptops this year that are members of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price#:~:text=Asus%20ROG%20Zephyrus%20G14%20specs&amp;amp;text=Speaking%20of%20the%20touchpad%20and,sturdy%2C%20with%20very%20little%20flex."&gt;ROG Zephyrus gaming line&lt;/a&gt; — powerful, while still portable and attractive. You’d buy a Zephyrus if you want decent gaming results but also want an everyday work machine you could bring into the office or class. The Strix line eschews the latter role. These are gaming laptops. They are just for games. They’re not cheap, they’re not subtle, and they hold nothing back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Close-up of the ROG Strix logo on the Strix Scar 15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFPvN4jbdg4Fv03-vpjPWA8h18c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183651/mchin_190314_4347_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Strike. Slay. Stun.” is the Strix Scar’s motto.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zUSwu"&gt;That’s where the Strix Scar 15 stands out. Every aspect is designed with the gaming enthusiast in mind, and there are a number of unique features for those customers. Of course, those also come with a few trade-offs — and folks who might need to use their machine for tasks besides gaming should consider other options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D1Eslb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10248257"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="iFFcBD"&gt;The Strix Scar 15 starts at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/search?q=rog%20strix%20scar%2015&amp;amp;s_c=1"&gt;$2,199.99&lt;/a&gt; on the Asus store. The &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202006AM100000008"&gt;base model&lt;/a&gt; comes with a Core i7-10875H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super, 1GB of SSD storage, and a 240Hz screen. The model we’re looking at today is a significant step up from that: it costs &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202007AM150000006"&gt;$2,799.99&lt;/a&gt; and is powered by Intel’s eight-core Core i9-10980HK and an RTX 2070 Super, which are joined by 32GB of RAM, 2TB of storage, and a 1920 x 1080 300Hz screen (3ms response time). The 10980HK is a workhorse — it’s one of the most powerful mobile chips on the market — and 300Hz is the fastest display you can get on a 15-inch laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Strix Scar 15 seen at a 135-degree angle." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aTzXemr0v3qrt3uxufTnb2q6HSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183653/mchin_190314_4347_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says the design was inspired by a collaboration with BMW Designworks Group. See it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X80o4X"&gt;If you clicked on this review, you’re probably most curious about the frame rates this laptop is putting up. Suffice to say: they’re good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VPXwV"&gt;On &lt;em&gt;CS:GO&lt;/em&gt; at maximum settings, the Strix Scar averaged 248fps. Thanks to this model’s 300Hz screen, the chips aren’t just rendering 248fps; you’re actually seeing 248fps. You’ll see a frame rate difference between this system and an identical one with a 240Hz display, albeit a small one. (But to folks who play a lot of esports and first-person shooters, a small difference can matter.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="UDX7az"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The chips aren’t just rendering 248fps — you’re actually seeing 248fps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rW7ge8"&gt;Overall, &lt;em&gt;CS:GO &lt;/em&gt;was a smooth experience. The Scar only dipped below 100fps once when I was running through a thick flurry of dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXX38n"&gt;Not all titles are able to take full advantage of the 300Hz screen, unless you plan on bumping the quality settings down. The Strix put up 67fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s highest settings with ray tracing on Ultra. On &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt; (one of the most demanding games out there) cranked up to Ultra, the Scar averaged 54fps. Both games were quite playable on those settings, without any stuttering or slowdown. Those results are right on par with the MSI GE66 Raider (which put up 50fps on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;and 70fps on &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;) and beat the smaller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; by a significant margin. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 from the back." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t31NeL19hhWHFmS_xsfq1oTMIh4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183655/mchin_190314_4347_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With HDMI 2.0b, you can view content at up to 60Hz on a connected 4K monitor or TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="FZ2Zks"&gt;It’s worth noting that while I was letting the Scar rip in Turbo mode (the highest power profile available) the 10980HK got quite hot throughout my gaming session, spending a chunk of time in the mid-90s and even hitting 99 degrees Celsius a couple of times. When I swapped to the regular Performance profile, the CPU spent more time in the mid-high 80s, and I only saw a 1-2fps difference as a result. So if you’re worried about frying your hardware, you won’t miss much if you stay on the Performance profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sXeShN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The 10980HK got quite hot throughout my gaming session&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VP2QZ1"&gt;Moving on to other laptop stuff. Apart from its chips, what distinguishes the Strix Scar 15 as a gaming laptop is the design. It features a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, a luminous logo on the lid, and a bright LED strip around the front three sides. A glowing strip may seem obnoxious, but this one is actually more subdued than strips you may have seen on gaming rigs like MSI’s GE66 Raider. It wraps around the underside of the deck, so you don’t see it full-on; the effect is less garish gamer than the GE66 Raider and more fancy nightclub. (You can turn all of the RGB stuff off, of course. But then, what’s the point?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XsFFNA"&gt;Another cool thing is the deck design, which is printed with what Asus calls “Cybertext.” Basically, Republic of Gamers is written all over it in an urban-chic sort of font. It’s subtle and far from distracting, but it gives the whole product a subtle sci-fi vibe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHnaHM"&gt;Speaking of the keyboard deck: the palm rests are coated in a unique “soft-touch paint.” It’s much smoother than your typical palm rest (you can very much feel the difference when you touch the rest of the chassis) and is quite nice to lay your hands on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y815DN"&gt;Asus keyboards are often among my favorites, and the Strix Scar’s keyboard is no exception. I love typing on this. I feel like my fingers are flying while using it. There’s a satisfying click with very little resistance. And I especially appreciate the convenient row of hotkeys at the top, which includes volume controls, a microphone mute, one that changes the performance profile, and another button that brings up Armoury Crate (Asus’ app where you can adjust various settings and features). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bwx9P7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You have a good port selection at your disposal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47EDtA"&gt;If you’d rather plug in your own peripherals, you have a good port selection at your disposal. There are three USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports and an audio jack on the left side, while the back houses one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C port (which supports DisplayPort, but not PD charging), the charging port, one LAN RJ-45, and one HDMI 2.0. That’s most of what you’ll need but there’s one glaring omission: Thunderbolt. Plenty of people may not care about this, but it’s a port I’m disappointed not to see on a $2,799 laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpRAtR"&gt;On the right side is a Keystone II reader. A Keystone II is a physical key on which you can save personal settings. You can also use it to access a private storage space, which Asus refers to as a “shadow drive.” This can be encrypted if you have Windows 10 Pro. (Only this model ships with that operating system. You’ll need to upgrade from Windows 10 Home if you buy the base configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The lid of the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15 from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a9GgQF5vOtkTJ7Xe7w_VshYEvfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183660/mchin_190315_4347_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can link a shadow drive to multiple keystones to share access or create backups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9jUfqX"&gt;The Keystone II is a neat idea considering how many settings and profiles there are to keep track of on the Strix. In the ROG app GameVisual, you can choose between color presets for different types of games (FPS mode enhances brightness and contrast, RPG mode prioritizes vivid colors, etc.). In Aura Creator, you can customize your keyboard’s colors and animation. In GameFirst VI, you can prioritize bandwidth between the programs you have running; there are presets like Gaming First, Live Streaming First, and Multimedia First.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="mgdyqq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Keystone II is a neat idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t6uAS6"&gt;One more thing I like: the speakers. Music sounded great, with a nice surround quality. The Strix won’t replace a good external speaker and percussion was a bit tinny. But vocals were quite clear, and at maximum volume, I never heard distortion. The laptop’s fans get quite loud during gaming, but I had no trouble hearing my games’ audio over them. (You can also switch to the Silent profile if the whine is bothering you.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Close-up of the LED strip on the Asus ROG Strix Scar 15." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69glPYacI8MQwpTqEHpWWYpRrgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183650/mchin_190314_4347_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus says its “smart amp” technology makes real-time adjustments to the Strix’s speaker output to minimize distortion and prevent damage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="thBI83"&gt;There’s lots of good stuff on the Strix, as you can see. But there are trade-offs, too. Most of them aren’t super relevant to gaming (and thus, forgivable on a laptop like the Strix), but they’re worth bearing in mind nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvz9YJ"&gt;For one: there’s no webcam. It’s not a deal-breaker — streamers will be using their own equipment anyway — but it’s a big minus for anyone who would otherwise use the Strix for an occasional work meeting or virtual catch-up with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="xEaInJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10248274"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K145jC"&gt;I also have a couple of issues with the trackpad. It has discrete clickers, which require a bit more skittering around to press than integrated buttons. I like these particular clickers more than most, but they’re still easy to miss and I sometimes found myself whacking chassis when trying to click. Generally, I found it less responsive and less accurate than I wanted it to be. Occasionally, it thought I was clicking when I wasn’t, causing me to accidentally drag things everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6sPfL"&gt;The touchpad also has a nifty feature where it can morph into an LED number pad if you press an integrated NumLock button in the top-right corner — but I hit this button with my palm while typing and accidentally activated the Numpad several times. Unlike with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus’ ZenBooks&lt;/a&gt; that also have this feature, you can’t navigate with the touchpad while the Numpad is up, so I kept having to interrupt my workflow to deactivate it. (You can disable the touchpad itself with F10, but there’s not an easy way to disable the NumPad without disabling the touchpad.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPbHvr"&gt;The biggest downside, though, is battery life. I averaged two hours and 28 minutes of sustained multitasking and office work with the Strix on the Battery Saver profile with the screen around 200 nits of brightness. (With all the battery-saving features off and a slightly heavier load, I got as low as one hour.) The Strix is a gaming laptop, so I wasn’t expecting hours upon hours of juice. Still, plenty of competitors do better: The MSI GE66 Raider (also powering an LED strip and RGB keyboard) made it through four hours of that same workload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Evt1jx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10248279"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMRCnB"&gt;Gaming on battery is possible, but not great. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;ran mostly in the high teens and low 20s. I got an hour and 15 minutes of the game on a charge, but I started to see stuttering when the Strix was down to 60 percent (about half an hour in) and the game became unplayable at 10 percent. Realistically, if you plan on bringing the Scar anywhere, you’ll need to bring the massive 280W adapter and spend some time charging the device. (It took 45 minutes to charge up to 60 percent during very light Chrome use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPHWTO"&gt;Overall, these nitpicks emphasize Asus’ priority with the Scar. It’s not a laptop that’s meant to double as a travel companion or a work-from-home driver — don’t buy it to be your primary PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar keyboard and touchpad seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bWsp4RQkgOp05sBWK83_UiqjnPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22183659/mchin_190315_4347_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See that “NumLK” thing in the top-right corner? The NumPad pops up if you tap that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="8UlXaM"&gt;But that doesn’t mean the Scar isn’t great at what it’s supposed to be great at, which is gaming. Its results are on par with those of the best 15-inch rigs on the market, and it offers useful customization software with a unique colorful design to boot. If you need the best frame rates and the fastest screen, the Strix Scar 15 is a fine purchase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra S Pen support confirmed by FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k7JuyGdM5XYdPxHLHmvfobBHUrk=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571196/41821.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJfOmO"&gt;An FCC listing confirms that Samsung’s S Pen stylus can be used with the company’s upcoming flagship Galaxy S21 Ultra phone. The confirmation, first &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-s-pen-1186549/"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A3LSMG998B/Test-Report/Wireless-Charging-Test-Report-5034277"&gt;a test report&lt;/a&gt; for model number SMG998B. The discovery lends clarity to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;recent statements&lt;/a&gt; from Samsung mobile president TM Roh, who said that some of the “most well-loved features” of the Galaxy Note will be coming to other Samsung devices in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOmYqu"&gt;The FCC test report explicitly describes an EUT (Equipment Under Test) device that can be used with an S Pen in both hover and click modes. “The EUT can also used with a stylus device (S Pen). The EUT operates with the S Pen in two different inductive coupling modes of S Pen motion detection (Hover and Click) operating in the range of 0.53 –0.6MHz.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UKiYUlam4WW3Qv6faQP669p36uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22192788/s21_fcc_listing_uwb_and_s_pen.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The relevant section of the FCC test report showing S-PEN support and other features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VGjqJT"&gt;The listing also confirms wireless power transfer (to charge things like the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro earbuds&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231623/6ghz-wifi-6e-explained-speed-availability-fcc-approval"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt;, and UWB on the yet to be announced Galaxy S21 Ultra. Last week Roh also said that Samsung planned to &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;do more with ultra-wideband in 2021&lt;/a&gt; with help from partners, like using UWB to locate objects or your family pet, open doors, and personalize car experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouNX2b"&gt;Everything should become clear at the upcoming Samsung event in January, presumably on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;Thursday the 14th&lt;/a&gt; if rumors hold.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Telegram gets Discord-like group voice chats</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pvzOc9Uq9mxhPeGNbbN8geZNVQ=/0x0:540x360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68571180/groupchats.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9V7Ue"&gt;Telegram is adding a new group voice chats feature that’s similar to an always-on Discord room. Voice chats are now part of existing text chats, and operate as a persistent option to speak live with friends or family. As they’re always available, you can dip in and out of voice chats just like you would in a Discord room or call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LT4Gfu"&gt;Telegram is supporting “a few thousand participants,” so even bigger groups for things like live events will include voice chats. The feature appears at the top of an existing group chat, if enabled, allowing anyone to join the conversation freely. On the desktop versions of Telegram for Windows and Mac, you can also use a push-to-talk key for voice chats to control your microphone input.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOp6VTbfe2PlIMXbE3zccowddLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22192787/telegramandroid.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram’s new voice chat overlay for Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CQZSam"&gt;Telegram has also built a useful voice chat overlay for Android, which operates as a system-wide floating widget. It lets you see who’s talking or operate microphone and mute options when Telegram is running in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SLCpd"&gt;At the moment group voice chats is focused on audio, but &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats"&gt;Telegram says it’s adding&lt;/a&gt; video and screen sharing features in the coming weeks. If you’re interested in trying out group voice chats you’ll need to be an admin of a group to enable the feature in the group settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSxCbD"&gt;Alongside the group voice chats option, Telegram CEO Pavel Durov &lt;a href="https://t.me/durov/142"&gt;has revealed&lt;/a&gt; that the service is nearing 500 million users. Telegram now plans to monetize its service with an ad platform that’s designed for one-to-many public channels. Durov describes the platform as “one that is user-friendly, respects privacy and allows us to cover the costs of servers and traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ciFHv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 23rd 6:15AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Telegram monetization plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nearly half a billion users played Among Us in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Among Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AMrVnjByV-VHm4Gi6ofI05026Sw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68570242/ss_a0f2416e11bf5b47788eaa3617e092b73962b145.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: InnerSloth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qKHiUD"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/blog/worldwide-digital-games-market"&gt;roughly half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; reportedly playing it in November, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; has had the most monthly players for a mobile game ever, beating giants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/10/21060877/pokemon-go-record-revenue-2019-niantic-labs-ar-growth"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon GO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. According to Nielsen’s SuperData, the game is “by far the most popular game ever in terms of monthly players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CS899C"&gt;The success is even more remarkable because InnerSloth — the company that makes Among Us — &lt;a href="http://www.innersloth.com/About.php"&gt;only has four employees&lt;/a&gt;. That’s roughly 125 million players per person who works on the game. It’s proven to be so popular that the studio decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;cancel a sequel that was in the works&lt;/a&gt; and just put all its effort into improving the original. It even caught the attention of sitting congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;who livestreamed herself playing it&lt;/a&gt; to try to encourage people to vote, with an audience on Twitch that peaked at over 400 thousand viewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtsuKY"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Carter Rogers, Principal Analyst at SuperData, said that the next-most popular game in terms of monthly active users only clocked in at 300 million. Rogers notes that Nielsen arrives at its figures through a mix of “point-of-sale and event data from publishers, developers and payment service providers.” &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176459/among-us-nintendo-switch-cross-play-launch"&gt;release on the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; was recent enough that it didn’t have an appreciable impact on the game’s total numbers in Nielsen’s analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYnLBZ"&gt;The fact that &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; had 500 million players shows the outstanding reach you can get by making a free game that runs on mobile devices. According to SuperData, only three percent of those 500 million players were playing the PC version. To put that number in perspective, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most hyped AAA game launches we’ve seen in a long time, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;sold 13 million copies this month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m7MCxS"&gt;Of course, there’s a large price difference between the games (&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is free on mobile, and $5 on PC), but it shows that the audience for mobile games is much larger than other platforms. InnerSloth is working to ensure that Among Us has some staying power by continuing to add new content to it, like the Airship map with new tasks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168243/among-us-innersloth-new-map-airship-early-2021"&gt;that’s being added early next year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roast your own Spotify listens with this snarky AI</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h9pJGW"&gt;The yearly Spotify Wrapped is a rather upbeat affair, which doesn’t doesn’t quite match everyone’s mood this year. For the more sullen among us, there’s another option: &lt;a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/"&gt;a bot from The Pudding&lt;/a&gt; that will judge us for our crimes of listening to terrible music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWfXOF"&gt;If you want to be judged, you open a page titled “How Bad is Your Spotify” and you log in with your Spotify account. (It might take a couple refreshes on the “Loading your music library” page.) This absolute jerk of an AI then drags you mercilessly while it pulls your playlists and top tracks. It asks you questions before it shows any results, in phrasing that gives the plain text the same aura as the girls who bullied me in middle school. &lt;em&gt;Did you really listen to Clementine by Sarah Jaffe?&lt;/em&gt; (Yes) &lt;em&gt;Like ironically?&lt;/em&gt; (No…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8ukO8"&gt;The final judgement comes in the form of a multi-hyphenated phrase, followed by a page of loose statistics (I am apparently 24 percent basic). This stupid little computer program deemed my Spotify listens mason-jar-candle-from-target-craft-beer-snob-wet-ass bad. And you know what? It’s right. I listened to a frankly unholy amount of Hozier this year. Spotify Wrapped wanted me to be proud of that, but I’ve spent the year hating the fact that I was too bummed out and busy to actually seek out new and exciting artists. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0BDwdm_jXA_TxOLYNU615qD808=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22191874/IMG_2712.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RNGZB"&gt;The bot is not actually that personalized. It will ask everyone the same boilerplate questions in a snarky tone. But it still gave me the validation I didn’t know I craved. My music taste kinda sucks, but whose doesn’t? Who among us doesn’t love to listen to the same old tried-and-true songs that hit just right, even if they earn the scorn of our more pretentious friends? Please join me in this journey of shameless shamefulness, and find some joy in a well-earned roast.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC says third-largest cryptocurrency was sold all wrong</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYTrTHQ5OR_09PmtitMZ_W3seOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68569791/acastro_1901001_3701_indieGameDevs_still.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vp9aWN"&gt;Ripple, its former CEO and founder Christian Larsen, and its current CEO Bradley Garlinghouse are being &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-338"&gt;sued by the US Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The SEC says that they raised more than $1.3 billion through an unregistered securities offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XfLHO"&gt;The suit claims that Ripple violated securities laws by selling XRP, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ripple-to-face-sec-suit-over-xrp-cryptocurrency-11608598800"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; calls&lt;/a&gt; “the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value,” over a seven-year period starting in 2013. According to the complaint, the “illegal securities offering” created an information asymmetry that let Larsen and Garlinghouse sell XRP to investors who only knew what Larsen and Garlinghouse chose to tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQ2a72"&gt;At the heart of the suit is a basic question about XRP: &lt;a href="https://www.iflr.com/article/b1m2pm9g4n65mk/cryptocurrencies-and-us-securities-laws-beyond-bitcoin-and-ether"&gt;is it a security or a currency&lt;/a&gt;? According to the SEC’s suit, it’s a security, and so Ripple didn’t provide its investors with the proper information they needed to assess any potential risk. According to Garlinghouse, it’s a virtual currency, which means the SEC has nothing to do with it. The SEC has previously ruled that bitcoin and Ethereum are currencies. Also, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/ripple-labs-inc-resolves-criminal-investigation"&gt;the Justice Department treated XRP&lt;/a&gt; as a currency in 2015, when Ripple settled a suit over its business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emoJ9F"&gt;But XRP differs from bitcoin and Ethereum in an important way. For those two cryptocurrencies, new coins are created through a “mining” process, which is ongoing. Ripple started XRP by creating 100 billion units all at once. Ripple owns about 6.4 billion XRP, and Garlinghouse and Larsen also own a good chunk of it. Another 48 billion XRP are held in reserve, for periodic sales. This difference may be why the SEC is claiming XRP is a security, not a currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PiCIuc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I appreciate you saying what this could mean for the larger U.S. crypto industry. The SEC is doing the opposite of “fostering innovation” here in the US.  It’s not just XRP they’re attacking here. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b"&gt;https://t.co/fGzrVmhu8b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brad Garlinghouse (@bgarlinghouse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1341405037948493826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="THcfd6"&gt;The SEC has won similar suits against Block.one and Kik in the past, saying that the initial coin offerings these startups offered were actually securities. But those cases were different; Kik and Block.one did their ICOs &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; an SEC directive in 2017. XRP came into existence years before that directive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HugUQ"&gt;The lawsuit didn’t come as a surprise; Garlinghouse &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/sec-to-sue-ripple-over-xrp-sales-ceo-says"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that the company expected the suit, and Ripple has already published its &lt;a href="https://ripple.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Ripple-Wells-Submission-Summary.pdf"&gt;Wells response&lt;/a&gt;, a document that explains to the SEC that its actions were legal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QD3fP3"&gt;An important part of settling whether XRP is a currency or a security may involve something called the Howey test, which was created by a 1946 Supreme Court case. That ruling defined a security as an investment of money in a shared enterprise with an expectation of profits from others’ work. According to Ripple, XRP doesn’t satisfy the Howey test for a variety of reasons, but especially because no one bought XRP with the expectation of getting Ripple’s profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4Xnh1"&gt;The SEC’s complaint challenges that. In 2016, Ripple admitted to the New York State Department of Financial Services that buyers were “purchasing XRP for speculative purposes.” It also cites a hedge fund investor who owned XRP saying in 2015 that “the increase in XRP value is heavily dependent on the success of Ripple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2zZ6p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
