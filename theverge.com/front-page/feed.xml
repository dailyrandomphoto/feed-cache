    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;We saw some of the best iPad deals of the year during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but if you missed out, there are still a couple of decent discounts available. Whether you’re after the high-end iPad Pro or the most affordable Apple tablet, the entry-level iPad, there’s a sale going on somewhere you may be interested in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2aVlZ"&gt;Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find the most notable deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers on a daily basis. But that’s often what our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out. Below, we’ve listed the best deals available on each iPad model that is currently available, some of which are outgoing models with freshly introduced replacements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ehglg9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;Announced during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;the September iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"&gt;2021 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s latest entry-level tablet and replaces the outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;eighth-gen model from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, this would leave the older model ripe for the picking as retailers may drum up some fire sale pricing to get rid of old stock, but at this time, there are no good deals to be found on the eighth-gen model, if you can even find it. As a result, you can feel comfortable steering clear of the 2020 version and get the latest and greatest of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;The new, ninth-generation iPad starts at $329, just as its predecessor, though the base model now has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; instead of 32GB. You can also still opt for the model with &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUWwO2PdJE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $479. If you prefer your iPad to include cellular connectivity, the 64GB, LTE-equipped configuration runs $459 and the 256GB variant $609. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMpIom"&gt;The updates for the 2021 model include a faster A13 Bionic processor and a 12MP ultrawide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. Many other features carry over from its predecessor; the new entry-level model has the same 10.2-inch display, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor built into the home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qnjdLM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10752834"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F483978365&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; is currently discounting 64GB iPad with Wi-Fi by $30, which remains the steepest discount we’ve seen on the latest model. The same $30 discount also extends to the 256GB model with Wi-Fi, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91TLNJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon in the silver colorway for $449&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F870975735&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart in either color&lt;/a&gt; for the same price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MKkmFl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the $329 iPad compares to its last-gen predecessor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22678374/apple-ipad-2020-vs-2021-comparison-upgrade"},{"title":"10 of the best Apple Arcade games for your new iPhone or iPad","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22815442/iphone-ipad-best-games-apple-arcade-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="njqbEo"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTw4HZ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sixth-generation iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; has a larger screen than its predecessor, along with a top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and options for 5G. It has forfeited its 3.5-millimeter headphone jack and dedicated home button in the process, but overall it’s a solid device that brings a fully refreshed design to Apple’s small tablet form factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBkkEE"&gt;The changes and refinements to the new iPad Mini come at a heftier price, however, and the new 64GB Wi-Fi model now starts at $499. Electing 256GB of storage brings the price up to $649, while the 5G cellular models are $649 for 64GB and $799 for 256GB. These are some big numbers for a small iPad, and the larger iPad Air might be worth considering if you prefer your dollar to go further with more screen real estate. But if you want the latest and greatest from Apple in a smaller format, this is where the action is, especially now that Apple and other retailers have officially discontinued selling the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2019 model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NMDW5P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10743705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zw4xQv"&gt;Right now, discounts on the sixth-gen Mini at Amazon are fairly limited. Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G91LXFP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the 64GB model with Wi-Fi in select colorways&lt;/a&gt; for $494.00, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9LPNLG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model with Wi-Fi for $639.&lt;/a&gt; Most other retailers, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1664337-REG%2Fapple_mk7m3ll_a_ipad_mini_wi_fi_64gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107515/1036?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7r3lla.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, are selling the 2021 model at $499, its full retail price. Best Buy is also offering 30 percent off select mice, 15 percent off select keyboards, and a handful of other discounts with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfUz2VOgrdA" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase of either Wi-Fi-equipped configuration&lt;/a&gt;. If the prior-generation iPad Mini has given any indication, however, deals on the 2021 iPad Mini might be light and infrequent moving forward, partly because it has such minimal competition in its product segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KGao5s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 41,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB and 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at around $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2yrbb"&gt;We’ve previously seen the base model drop to as low as $489. While it’s currently not available for that cheap, Walmart is selling the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010521&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray%2F462727496&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wi-Fi-equipped model with 64GB of storage in multiple colorways for $539&lt;/a&gt;, a modest 11 percent off the typical list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike some of the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10917835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance at Best Buy in several Wi-Fi-equipped configurations and colors. Right now, the retailer is selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi02BD2dZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $809.99&lt;/a&gt; ($90 off), the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmi28RDHBK" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB configuration for $989.99&lt;/a&gt; ($110 off), and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgjJQICs36o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB variant for $1,104.99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $1,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi starts at $799. While we’ve previously seen the price of this model drop to as low as $649.97, right now &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0932B5NVD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1229396/9383?subId1=VergeBestiPadDeals010522&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; are only selling it for $749, which is a modest $50 discount. Amazon is also currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0931YYPNN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting the 512GB model to $999.99&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B0931Z3CWQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-11-inch-Wi%E2%80%91Fi-128GB/dp/B09326YKNZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB variants&lt;/a&gt;, dropping the latter in select colorways to $1,399.99 and $1,799.99, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yhnrgA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10840379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>AMC Networks’ Sentai acquisition is the latest sign that anime is big business</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cH-lC1uacMcl0VEh9-dnQucBkVE=/90x0:996x604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352937/FIX0Bg8XIAUSUxf.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As part of the deal, AMC Networks will own the anime streaming service Hidive, which has &lt;/em&gt;Lupin the 3rd&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sentai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHk2zr"&gt;AMC Networks (not the movie theater chain) has acquired the anime distributor Sentai from the Cool Japan Fund investment fund, &lt;a href="https://www.amcnetworks.com/press-releases/amc-networks-acquires-leading-global-anime-distributor-sentai-including-direct-to-consumer-anime-platform-hidive/"&gt;the company announced Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of the deal, AMC Networks will now own the anime-focused streaming service Hidive, which will join the company’s roster of targeted streaming services that already includes AMC Plus, Acorn TV, Shudder, Sundance Now, and ALLBLK. Terms of the deal weren’t disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2A6G5"&gt;The acquisition is the latest signal of the growing importance of anime content to entertainment companies. Perhaps the most notable anime push was Sony’s $1.175 billion purchase of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617356/sony-crunchyroll-att-funimation-acquisition"&gt;anime streaming service Crunchyroll&lt;/a&gt; from AT&amp;amp;T, which brought Crunchyroll and another anime streaming giant, Funimation, under one roof. But other companies have also been beefing up their anime offerings; Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527983/netflix-geeked-week-anime-trailers-mobile-suit-gundam-godzilla"&gt;a huge slate of anime series&lt;/a&gt;, while Disney was willing to make an anime anthology series of one of its biggest franchises: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is doing great, according to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/StipGqIgGVVr1QwQ-4LfUd8v_Ww=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352645/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PMtWzM"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s latest subscriber figures make it seem like HBO and its sister service HBO Max are doing pretty well — great, even! In a &lt;a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/us/atnt2/sec/sec-show.aspx?Type=html&amp;amp;FilingId=15462042&amp;amp;CIK=0000732717&amp;amp;Index=10000"&gt;regulatory filing&lt;/a&gt; this week, AT&amp;amp;T revealed that it beat its projected year-end goal with 73.8 million total subscribers between HBO and HBO Max (even after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738967/hbo-max-subscriptions-q3-2021-amazon-exit"&gt;breakup with Amazon&lt;/a&gt;). Not too bad, right? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83dm4C"&gt;But that win comes after a year of highly anticipated movie debuts meant to balloon subscriber numbers, and it’s still tens of millions of subscribers behind rivals like Disney Plus and Netflix. The numbers also come with some pretty big caveats. In other words, hold the applause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yogjgp"&gt;For one, AT&amp;amp;T’s figures (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/global/hbo-max-2021-subscriber-att-warnermedia-1235147025/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;) conflate two separate services — HBO, its cable business, and HBO Max, its streaming service — and they don’t distinguish how many subscribers each service has individually. WarnerMedia spokesperson Jaclyn Mandelbaum told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that more information “will be broken out in AT&amp;amp;T’s earnings in a couple weeks” but declined to specify figures for each service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CEJD0H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 should’ve been HBO Max’s year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AH0iOr"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s growth also looks less impressive given the high-profile content slate it served over the last year, including titles like &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;, and the third season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;. On top of that, HBO Max added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444063/hbo-max-ad-supported-tier-announced-pricing-release-date"&gt;lower-priced tier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278287/hbo-max-international-launch-june-2021-latin-america-europe-warnermedia-streaming"&gt;launched internationally&lt;/a&gt; partway through the year — both of which should have helped boost its subscribers substantially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VaM2I"&gt;Disney Plus added more than twice as many subscribers over a similar time period. Disney’s streaming service, which launched roughly six months before HBO Max, reported &lt;a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/the-walt-disney-company-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-earnings-for-fiscal-2021/"&gt;118.1 million paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of October 2021, up from &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/disney-plus-hits-86-8-million-subscribers-1234850846/"&gt;73.7 million&lt;/a&gt; about a year earlier. HBO’s 73.8 million record, on the other hand, is only up from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/story/2021/q4_earnings_2020.html"&gt;61 million subscribers globally&lt;/a&gt; at the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDW2u6"&gt;Streaming data is virtually impossible to tackle on a one-for-one comparison level for myriad reasons, not the least of which being that everyone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;playing by different rules&lt;/a&gt;. That’s to say nothing of how piracy, account-sharing, and features like auto-play can significantly skew a truly accurate picture of subscriber and title success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXRAWN"&gt;Last year should’ve been HBO Max’s year to win. It’s going to have to find new ways to grow without the help of a highly anticipated day-and-date slate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok’s latest deal could mean its videos are coming to waiting room TVs near you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/21mMS0vJCIf1p1yPMYQQ8qPmaFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352625/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWkndV"&gt;TikTok has already conquered our phones and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796353/tiktok-tv-app-now-available-samsung-lg-google-android-tv"&gt;TVs at home&lt;/a&gt;, but its next target will ensure you really can’t escape from cute pet videos, impressive feats, and oddly satisfying clips. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/press/atmosphere-integrates-tiktok"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the popular short-form video platform has partnered with &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/"&gt;Atmosphere&lt;/a&gt;, a startup that drums up the content to ambiently play in the background when you’re eating at a restaurant, lounging in a hotel, or sitting in a waiting room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VQoqI"&gt;Atmosphere already delivers content to places like Taco Bell, Texas Roadhouse, Burger King, and even Meineke, letting clients choose from a number of “channels” that suit different environments. And now, &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/press/atmosphere-integrates-tiktok"&gt;TikTok will get a channel dedicated&lt;/a&gt; to curated videos from the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="peujDB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Atmosphere essentially repurposes the videos it gathers, whether it’s from YouTube or TikTok&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="icYqsj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; says that Atmosphere essentially repurposes the videos it gathers, whether it’s from YouTube or TikTok. It then removes the audio, adds its own music (or potentially leaves it audio-less, since some venues keep their TVs on mute), slaps on a caption, and subsequently adds it to the stream of videos that make up a specific channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mLqjl"&gt;The lack of audio means you won’t be able to hear the trendy jingles you typically hear on a TikTok video (but maybe that’s for the best). As for how the creators behind the videos get compensated, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; notes that Atmosphere gets creators’ permission and works out a deal — it even gets some of its content for free, as the company essentially promotes creators by playing their videos in public areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI3RPR"&gt;You can check out what the TikTok channel might look like &lt;a href="https://atmosphere.tv/channels/tiktok"&gt;in a demo on Atmosphere’s site&lt;/a&gt;. The stream shows TikTok videos organized by hashtag, like #lifeisrandom and #coolrunning, which is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. Atmosphere also added its own music and set the videos against animated backgrounds. Creators’ usernames remain visible in each video, albeit probably tough to read from far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Fraggle Rock reboot looks like it will stay true to the original series</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUyEv1Id0bbESAfJb4wiFjEHK1k=/0x114:2190x1574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352534/010522_Fraggle_Rock_Back_Rock_Debut_Big_Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zN4u7t"&gt;Apple released a new trailer for its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; Apple TV Plus reboot on Wednesday (officially titled &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Back to the Rock&lt;/em&gt;), and it seems like the new series will be bringing back all of the hallmarks of the original show. The new trailer features charming puppets, a catchy song, and a dumb joke to kick things off that I actually found kind of funny, and you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H21eTqk9BP8"&gt;watch it all here&lt;/a&gt;. The 13-episode series debuts on January 21st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQNOI4"&gt;Apple TV Plus has become something of a destination for &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2020, the company debuted the first in a series of shorts called &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock: Rock On!&lt;/em&gt;, and in May 2020, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271931/fraggle-rock-apple-tv-plus-new-series-licensed-strategy"&gt;acquired past seasons of the original show&lt;/a&gt;. (Seems like someone over at Apple is a &lt;em&gt;Fraggle Rock&lt;/em&gt; fan. Maybe Tim Cook?) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnzBAT"&gt;The new series joins Apple TV Plus’ growing lineup of original shows geared toward children, which also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887382/apple-tv-plus-kids-trailers-content-snoopy-sesame-street-ghostwriter-helpsters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Snoopy Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Harriet the Spy,&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;em&gt;Ghostwriter&lt;/em&gt; reboot, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873176/apple-tv-plus-helpsters-ghostwriter-trailers-childrens-shows"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Helpsters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung made a dedicated smart home dashboard, and we want one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t_5zQKR7lVaH2S8FF_vIDG-2fqU=/21x0:2190x1446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70348775/Samsung_Home_Hub.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Home Hub is a one stop shop for your SmartThings home.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sbmkzd"&gt;Samsung introduced its first standalone SmartThings smart home controller at its CES 2022 keynote this week. The Samsung Home Hub is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SN0ZZg"&gt;The portable, 8.4-inch touchscreen tablet has Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant built-in and will use AI to anticipate what you might need (we’ll see how that pans out). The Home Hub sits vertically in a charging dock and has two microphones and two speakers for hearing notifications and giving voice commands. Based on the images the company has shared so far, it appears to run Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddsf9F"&gt;Samsung says at launch, the Home Hub will “be able to connect to every product within the SmartThings ecosystem,” with integrations for other devices, such as lights and door locks coming soon. There was no specific mention of this being a SmartThings software hub itself (Samsung has said it is integrating SmartThings hub software into many of its smart appliances), but it’s hard to imagine it won’t be. There’s no pricing available or a US release date, but it is scheduled to launch in Korea in March and globally after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJ9HyD"&gt;There are still a lot of things we want to know about this: Will Bixby be the only voice assistant option? Is the AI thing going to be super annoying? But, at first glance, this looks a lot like the smart home controller we wish Apple, Amazon, or Google would make. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWu9SHX6LIC2YPjyCbQyqBuWIPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148270/Samsung_Home_Hub_cooking.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Home Hub features Samsung SmartThings Cooking service, which is powered by Whisk, an AI-powered recipe platform. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BqpR5b"&gt;The transition from smartphone control of the smart home to voice control has not been a seamless one. There are many times when it’s easier to tap on a screen to turn on the lights or lock the back door than it is to raise your voice, and a simple, easily accessible interface to do this is something the smart home still needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y4ftuv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If we’re going to drag members of our households into the smart home, it’s got to be easier for them to control it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CzgDIw"&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have largely failed to provide a usable dashboard for this type of control, instead requiring multiple swipes and taps to get to what you need. These displays also try to be multitaskers in the home, part calendar, part radio, part TV, part smart home device, partly failing to do well most of what they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVtKPp"&gt;Case in point, Amazon’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;, which I thought would be the solution I’d been looking for to control my smart home; since I took down the aging iPad Mini I had installed in my wall. (Its screen finally gave up the ghost — turns out being permanently plugged in and sitting vertically on my wall for four years was not good for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Fv9VmS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Show 15 review: Alexa’s on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22839220/amazon-echo-show-15-review-wall-mounted-alexa-tablet-kitchen-tv"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="iiybzk"&gt;Sadly, the software on the Show 15 doesn’t live up to the promise of the hardware, and while it looks fantastic, its limited smart home controller interface means it just won’t work for my home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1K1tn"&gt;What I, and many like me, want is a dedicated smart home dashboard, something that has shortcuts to control devices, trigger scenes, and view live camera feeds. That’s not to say there isn’t room for Echo Shows and Google Nest Hubs that do part of what they’re supposed to do really well. But a dedicated smart home interface mounted on a wall or set up on a counter is what is needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INsKYD"&gt;There have been a few attempts at solving this problem — the &lt;a href="https://www.brilliant.tech/home"&gt;touchscreen Brilliant Control Panel&lt;/a&gt; that replaces your existing light switches is an innovative solution that takes advantage of a house’s existing wiring. But installing that system in every room will set you back a pretty penny, and the screen is much smaller than a tablet, making it less intuitive for all users.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XTNxLts8ZSJtwi8Oh8e9PjnyrMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145171/2021_0611_Samsung_4D_Flex_Family_Hub_Menus_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Family Hub refrigerator features a built-in tablet that acts as a smart home controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cqcOVG"&gt;What I like about Samsung’s Home Hub so far is its size, its orientation, and its potential portability. A vertical screen is actually more useful for smart home control than a horizontal one, as you can fit more icons on the screen that way and ideally have quick access to more controls. The stand for the Samsung Home Hub looks like it could also hold the screen horizontally if you preferred, although it probably will only charge in the vertical position, and Samsung has said it can be picked up and moved around when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqyumo"&gt;The other thing it looks like they’ve done right here is make it a shared device. The problem with shoehorning existing tablets like the iPad into the role of a smart home dashboard is they’re designed as personal devices. A dedicated tablet for the home needs different software and a different approach.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/82DPvQk00b2cqDfDcL8PDB4xQRM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148278/Samsung_Home_Hub_energy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Energy monitoring of compatible appliances and services is part of Samsung SmartThings and can be monitored on the Home Hub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M27yiA"&gt;I’ve used the Samsung Family Hub smart fridge, and the Home Hub interface looks similar. Both largely resemble a blown-up version of Samsung’s SmartThings smartphone app. There’s a Favorites home screen with your favorite devices on it, a Devices tab for all your gadgets, and a Life tab where you’ll find Samsung’s connected services — such as Cooking, Clothing Care, Energy, Pet, Air and Home Care Wizard. That last one monitors your Samsung smart appliances and tells you when you need a new water filter for your fridge, as well as offers troubleshooting tips when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IiMBt"&gt;It’s not the smart home dashboard of my dreams, but it is a step in the right direction: a dedicated device for controlling the many aspects of your smart home that doesn’t attempt to do unnecessary party tricks but gives you and your household an easy way to turn the home on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="bphjZn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart displays from Google and Amazon have failed to provide a usable smart home interface&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhIHQW"&gt;Speaking of Samsung’s connected services, the SmartThings Energy service, which monitors the power usage of all compatible connected devices and recommends ways for you to save energy based on usage patterns, is being expanded to include more products and services. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-smartthings-expands-smartthings-energy-service-for-eco-friendly-home-solutions/"&gt;Samsung also announced partnerships earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that enable real-time monitoring of whole-home energy consumption in the SmartThings App. This type of integration should allow homeowners to set up automations based on energy costs or demand response events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtNybN"&gt;During its CES keynote, Samsung also announced that it’s a founding member of the newly minted Home Connectivity Alliance (HCA). Founded in September 2021, the HCA’s main goal is creating “&lt;a href="https://homeconnectivityalliance.org/news-events/"&gt;Cloud to cloud interoperability across brands&lt;/a&gt;,” according to its website. At the keynote, Katherine Shin from Trane Technologies (an HVAC manufacturer that is also a member) said that the HCA is a global coalition of smart home appliance manufacturers focused on full interoperability between products. Interoperability has been a big problem in the home appliance space, as upgrade cycles for large appliances are much slower than for speakers and light bulbs. Members of HCA include GE Appliances, Electrolux, and Haier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbFUi"&gt;Samsung is also part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter, a new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; with similar goals. How this initiative will fit in with Matter is unclear at this stage. Matter is a local protocol, with devices communicating primarily over a local network while still allowing IP access to connect to the internet. This new Alliance appears to be focused on expanding connectivity between cloud-based services. This is something Samsung has been pursuing more aggressively since it started to transition its SmartThings platform from a hardware-based smart home hub to a software-based service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTHv7x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 5:25PM ET, Wednesday, January 5th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more details about the Home Hub and the HCA based on new information released by Samsung since we first published this article, including that the Home Hub will be released globally, previously the company had only said it would be launching in Korea.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sundance Film Festival goes virtual, Grammys postponed over omicron concerns</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CyXAUr"&gt;Both the Grammy Awards and the Sundance Film Festival have changed their 2022 plans due to a rise in COVID-19 cases across the country (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/grammy-awards-postponed-indefinitely-due-to-concerns-about-omicron-covid-spread.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2022/01/sundance-2022-cancels-in-person-1234688754/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Indiewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Grammy Awards show has been postponed until further notice, and the Sundance Film Festival will go virtual, rather than risk an in-person event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rNxzz5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Grammy Awards was postponed last year because of the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AP8GDo"&gt;The 64th Grammy Awards ceremony was scheduled for January 31st, but as noted in a &lt;a href="https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/2022-grammys-complete-winners-nominees-nominations-list"&gt;post on the Grammy Awards website&lt;/a&gt;, CBS and the Recording Academy have decided to push it back “after careful consideration and analysis with city and state officials, health and safety experts.” There isn’t mention of a rescheduled date, but CBS and the Recording Academy say that “will be announced soon.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/05/entertainment/grammys-2021/index.html"&gt;The Grammy Awards was postponed&lt;/a&gt; last year because of the pandemic and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22329964/grammy-awards-2021-how-to-watch-online"&gt;was held in March without a live audience&lt;/a&gt;. Viewership for the 2021 Grammys broadcast &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/business/media/grammy-awards-ratings.html"&gt;reportedly hit a record low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43PDAc"&gt;Sundance Institute CEO Joana Vicente and festival director Tabitha Jackson &lt;a href="http://sundancecollab.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;amp;chash=7a53928fa4dd31e82c6ef826f341daec.1411&amp;amp;nosocial=1"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; modified plans for the Sundance Film Festival, with the Utah-based show airing solely online. It was initially supposed to be a hybrid event, but festival organizers decided to go all virtual, citing the high transmissibility of the omicron variant. The Sundance Film Festival will still begin on January 20th and will consist of 11 days of online programming, with some adjustments to the screening schedule. COVID-19 had an impact on the Sundance Film Festival last year as well — not only was the event held online, but the effects of the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262520/sundance-film-festival-2021-pandemic-these-days-pink-cloud"&gt;were artfully weaved into some of the featured films&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dead By Daylight drops Leatherface cosmetics after reports of harassment against Black players</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LujzN2Y4tFPqqYNVVgM0A1sWsug=/26x0:1646x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70352079/055_leatherface_key_art.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVKOsu"&gt;Behaviour Interactive, developer of co-op survival horror game &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt;, has decided to remove certain cosmetics from the game after years of complaints that they were being used in racist harassment against Black players. Announced as part of a &lt;a href="https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/302915/"&gt;developer update&lt;/a&gt;, the cosmetics will be removed in a forthcoming patch, and players who have unlocked the cosmetics will be compensated with in-game currency. In its update, Behaviour Interactive wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhzz3g"&gt;“Members of the community have shared their experiences with people targeting and harassing them while using some of these masks. These reports were disheartening to hear, and we absolutely condemn this behaviour. We are not comfortable having these masks in the game when they are used as a tool to spread hate. To that end, we will be removing The Cannibal’s unlockable faces in this upcoming Mid-Chapter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g9gUUc"&gt;Introduced to the game several years ago, the cosmetics were special skins designed for the “The Cannibal” killer, also known as Leatherface from 1974’s horror movie classic &lt;em&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&lt;/em&gt;. The cosmetics allowed Leatherface to wear the faces of one of the four original survivor characters, one of whom is a Black woman named Claudette. Black players expressed unease about the Claudette version of the skin as it seemed like an instance of blackface. Blackface is a racist trope in media in which non-Black performers make themselves look like caricatures of Black people by darkening their skin, drawing on huge, exaggerated red lips, or wearing unkempt kinky-haired wigs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="37ivLz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not comfortable having these masks in the game when they are used as a tool to spread hate.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kFrk5M"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MiladyConfetti"&gt;MiladyConfetti&lt;/a&gt; is a Black streamer and a member of the&lt;em&gt; Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; partner program. She described the skin as “horrific” and originally thought the game was glitching as she didn’t believe a skin like that — one that involved a white man wearing the skin of a Black woman in a literal case of blackface — could exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S3Nzm"&gt;In addition to the skin itself evoking the specter of blackface, the way the skin was used caused an even greater concern. Black &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; streamers reported killers who would wear the Claudette version of the Leatherface skin — which they had taken to calling it “Blackface Leatherface” — and harass them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2RB0C"&gt;“I was harassed by players who knew I was a streamer particularly with the Blackface Leatherface cosmetic,” MiladyConfetti told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I knew it was the players because after being harassed in the game, they would come to my stream and call me slurs and acknowledge that they were the killer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n866NJ"&gt;MiladyConfetti and other Black &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; players began a campaign advocating for the cosmetic’s removal citing its uncomfortable closeness to the racist act of blackface and its abuse by players targeting Black streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mabjdD"&gt;In November 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sistakaren"&gt;SistaKaren&lt;/a&gt;, another &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight&lt;/em&gt; partner creator, released a video breaking down the problem she and others have had with Blackface Leatherface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0goPZx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RE7RZv_dhC0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSd1PZ"&gt;The video contains numerous anecdotes of Black streamers being targeted by killers wearing the Claudette Leatherface skin. SistaKaren described how a Claudette Leatherface sent her messages saying, “I hate Black people,” and other messages that were ostensibly slurs but censored by chat filters. Another player recounted an incident in which a Claudette Leatherface would grief them, exclusively toying with or killing them while ignoring other survivors. The incidents of harassment got so bad that Black players, upon seeing a Leatherface wearing the Claudette skin, would immediately disconnect from the game as a protective measure, which, ironically, led to even more harassment. One Claudette Leatherface user incited a protracted harassment campaign against a streamer who disconnected upon seeing the skin, sending racist and toxic messages to the streamer’s Discord, Twitter, and Instagram profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1zLar"&gt;The Claudette Leatherface skin is another example of racist players using things designed to be representative for Black people as a tool of harassment. Twitch has long struggled with people spamming the Trihard emote, which features the face of Black streamer Trihex, to harass Black streamers. The same is true of the “cmonbruh” emote, prompting many streamers &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-still-hasnt-fixed-its-racist-emote-problem-1835253131"&gt;to ban the use of both emotes&lt;/a&gt; outright to prevent that kind of behavior. In &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption Online,&lt;/em&gt; players &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/15/18183843/red-dead-online-black-character-racism"&gt;concocted elaborate racist roleplays&lt;/a&gt; in which they act as slave catchers to grief players with Black avatars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SuJNH8"&gt;“I feel good that [Claudette Leatherface] is removed,” MiladyConfetti said. “It was long overdue, especially because this conversation started years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0mZiWf"&gt;Other players agreed, including the senior character artist at Behaviour Interactive who made the skins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9j4vsJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As the artist who made the bubba masks, I'm glad they are being removed. As cool as it would have been to have an easter egg for all survivors. The reality of it is there were many players using them in harmful ways. Gamers, no matter the game please treat others with respect.&lt;/p&gt;— Eric Bourdages (@EZE3D) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EZE3D/status/1478429227699650579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 4, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riPDeU"&gt;Other players &lt;a href="https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/303173/is-removing-bubbas-masks-can-really-prevent-the-hateful-behaviors"&gt;on &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight’s&lt;/em&gt; forums&lt;/a&gt; see this action as ineffective as it seemingly “punishes” people who worked to earn the skin while racist players will simply find other ways to be racist. They suggest improved reporting features as a better solution to the racism problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhHdwq"&gt;SistaKaren understands that Behaviour hasn’t magically solved the problem of player racism in &lt;em&gt;Dead By Daylight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHPpXk"&gt;“It won’t [solve the racism problem], especially considering how anti-Black hostility and outright racism continue to be prevalent and normalized in gaming,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oubvmV"&gt;“That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t also acknowledge the ongoing harm that Black players would experience,” she said. “While all of us have experienced racism in the game, the worst instances are always with someone wearing this cosmetic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s7p7u"&gt;Behaviour Interactive’s decision to remove the Claudette Leatherface acknowledges that even though something may have been conceived with benign intentions, its use causes harm and that harm will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KxTOi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6czLG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil promises Alexa is coming to its smartwatches ‘soon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Skagen Falster 6 showing the Alexa widget with a message that reads “coming soon”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5YDfm4BxmDu2bNvX0wZdizZ4VE=/0x335:4030x3022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351868/Image_from_iOS_watermarked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Alexa is “coming soon” to Fossil Gen 6 watches&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Victoria Song/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="61DndW"&gt;Although Fossil launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22864897/fossil-razer-skagen-gen-6-smartwatch-wear-os"&gt;two new smartwatches at CES&lt;/a&gt; today, there’s one big elephant in the room: the upgrade to Wear OS 3 won’t arrive for several months. To take the sting out of the wait, Fossil snuck in another new feature for its Gen 6 smartwatches: Amazon Alexa. As for when Alexa will arrive, you’ll have to settle for “coming soon.” Hopefully before Wear OS 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjmEpD"&gt;In a statement to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/05/fossil-amazon-alexa-gen-6-smartwatches/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Fossil says the update will come in the first half of 2022. This tracks with what Fossil told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a CES briefing, in which spokesperson Robyn Sills said Alexa would come to the Gen 6 devices “early this year.” Fossil sent me both the Skagen Falster 6 and the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch, and yup, there’s a widget just for Alexa. If you tap it, however, you won’t bring up the voice assistant. You’ll just see a “coming soon” message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9K9ADb"&gt;So, between “coming soon,” “early this year,” and “first half of this year,” it’s anyone’s guess. With features like this, it’s not uncommon to see companies hedge on timelines, lest they &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1398-i-love-deadlines-i-love-the-whooshing-noise-they-make"&gt;make like Douglas Adams&lt;/a&gt; and watch self-set deadlines whoosh by. Still, if all goes well, it appears likely that Alexa compatibility will arrive before Wear OS 3. As for when the Wear OS 3 upgrades will arrive, that’s up to Google. For now, both Google and Fossil haven’t budged from the equally vague mid-to-late 2022 timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmqVLg"&gt;It might seem curious as to why Fossil would even tease Alexa if it’s not ready yet. The most likely reason is to give everyone something to look forward to while waiting for Wear OS 3, which could arrive in a few months or a whole year from now. In a briefing, Fossil told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this awkward timing did impact initial Gen 6 sales, though surprisingly, the Gen 5E sales seem to be going strong. Given all the uncertainty, it makes sense that Fossil would want to highlight Alexa compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYf7mY"&gt;For what it’s worth, it is (or will be) a win for Fossil. Voice assistants are increasingly common on smartwatches, but customers don’t really have a say in which assistant comes with their wearable. Wear OS watches are currently tied to Google Assistant and Apple Watches are Siri-only. Samsung has inflicted Bixby onto Galaxy Watch owners for years, and while Samsung said you’d be able to opt for Google Assistant on the new Galaxy Watch 4, &lt;a href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/wearables/google-assistant-for-galaxy-watch-4/td-p/14235396"&gt;it has yet to officially arrive&lt;/a&gt;. Some watches, like Garmin’s newly announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22859098/garmin-venu-2-plus-vivomove-sport-smartwatches"&gt;Venu 2 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, simply connect you to your phone’s assistant. Others hook you up with a proprietary assistant, and that’s rarely a good time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lT7Op0"&gt;Right now, Fitbit is the only one that actually offers any sort of choice. Starting with the Fitbit Sense and Versa 3, you had the option between Alexa or Google Assistant. However, you could only do one or the other. As far as I can see on my review units, while there is an Alexa widget, that doesn’t stop you from using Google Assistant as well. Granted, there are few official details and Alexa on the wrist isn’t the best. However, Fossil offering a choice in assistants — or even the option to potentially use more than one — is a smart move. It’d just be smarter if it was here already. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJn5Vq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jKpnI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LI7jM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This Tablo ATSC 3.0 tuner is a DVR for the 4K over-the-air TV future  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H_6sahkeTtTE4IVXW3ipRVsA68o=/73x0:841x512/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70351824/tablo_atsc3_hdmi_insitu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This new Tablo box is built to grab TV from the air and record it.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tablo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d1hCwN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-atsc-3-quad-hdmi-a-tablo-dvr-for-nextgen-tv/"&gt;new Tablo ATSC 3.0 Quad HDMI&lt;/a&gt; is a DVR meant for the next generation of broadcast TV — which, if all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr"&gt;goes according to plan&lt;/a&gt;, will involve 4K HDR content being sent out over the airwaves for free. It can record up to four channels at once onto an external hard drive, letting you watch programs back on your schedule, not broadcasters’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcodtg"&gt;In the age of internet streaming, cable, and satellite, it can be hard to remember that there are still local TV stations broadcasting their programs over the airwaves, which anyone can watch for free if they have an antenna and receiver. But for some enthusiasts, viewing broadcast television is the new cord-cutting — and it’s those signals Tablos are made to record and playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UcFphc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;ATSC 3.0 supports 4K HDR broadcasts, which will largely be free to watch if you’ve got the equipment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K5cpIp"&gt;Cordcutter-friendly DVRs are a pretty mature concept at this point, with companies including Tablo and HDHomeRun producing them steadily for years. ATSC 3.0 changes things, though — it’s the follow-up to the digital standard that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_television_transition_in_the_United_States"&gt;replaced US analog TV broadcasts in 2009&lt;/a&gt;, and it supports plenty of upgrades, including support for 4K HDR broadcasts, high frame rate content, and more. While it’s currently not set to completely replace ATSC 1.0 anytime soon, some stations have started broadcasting content using both standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9AkzM"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/new-lineup-of-hdhomerun-ota-network-tuners-add-dvr-capabilities-and-expand-atsc-3-0-support/"&gt;HDHomeRun launched a new lineup&lt;/a&gt; which packed in ATSC 3.0 but limited it to just two of four available tuners. The new Tablo supports four ATSC 3.0 tuners. The Tablo can record either type of signal, depending on the channel it’s set to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7xwQ5"&gt;You can read more on the history of how ATSC 3.0 came to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/2/14488608/4k-tv-broadcasts-ajit-pai-atsc-3-hdr"&gt;in our explainer, here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A6naR"&gt;Apart from the fact that it can record four ATSC 3.0 streams at once, the new Quad HDMI works a lot like Tablo’s other DVRs. It hooks up to an antenna, hard drive, and your TV, and you can use it to watch live TV, or programs that you’ve recorded. Tablo says the interface will tell you which channels are using ATSC 1.0 and which are using 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KFjZlZLY7OQUyt5Dx7jbQP7R7uU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23147873/tablo_atsc3_quad_hdmi_in_situ_straight_crop_new.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tablo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tablo also offers a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.tablotv.com/tv-guide-data-subscriptions/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;subscription-based TV guide service&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; that unlocks additional filters and features.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AmwYuh"&gt;Tablo does warn that the experience won’t be exactly what its longtime users are used to. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173912/tablo-dvr-ad-skipping-ota-quad-tuner-internal-harddrive-ces-2019"&gt;automatic ad-skipping feature&lt;/a&gt; will only be available for ATSC 1.0 recordings, not for ATSC 3.0 ones. Tablo says it “hope[s] to be able to support this popular feature on ATSC 3.0 recordings in the future,” but it’s always best practice to buy something for the features it ships with, not the ones it might have later. The new Quad HDMI box also won’t be able to stream recorded content to other devices in your house, a feature available on &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/tablo-tv-connected-dvrs-how-they-work/#hdmidevices"&gt;some of Tablo’s other boxes&lt;/a&gt;. It’ll only be able to playback video on the TV to which it’s physically connected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="title"&gt;The DVR will ship in “spring 2022,” for a cost of $300. That’s not inexpensive, especially after you factor in the added expense of an external hard drive, which is required if you want the digital video recorder to actually record. In &lt;a href="https://www.tablotv.com/blog/tablo-atsc-3-quad-hdmi-a-tablo-dvr-for-nextgen-tv/#faq"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Nuvyyo (the company behind Tablo) tries to justify the price — compared to other ATSC 3.0-capable DVRs, all four of its tuners can make use of the new standard, instead of others that only have one or two hybrid tuners. For comparison, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SiliconDust-HDHomeRun-Flex-ATSC-NextGen/dp/B092GCN9NL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the HDHomeRun Flex 4K ATSC 3.0&lt;/a&gt; costs $200 and only supports the newer standard on two of its four tuners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pMf7s9"&gt;The extra NextGen tuners may not be that big of a deal now, since &lt;a href="https://www.rabbitears.info/market.php?request=atsc3"&gt;there aren't tons of ATSC 3.0 broadcasts&lt;/a&gt;, but could become a boon in the future if the rollout expands and broadcasters start taking advantage of the ability to send 4K HDR content over the air.&lt;/p&gt;
