    <title>Google is making it easier to swap between user profiles in Chrome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1DYS9hTStRS6eK7vZmQJVUiEiVU=/0x180:1080x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897630/New_profile_experience_in_Chrome.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRezsO"&gt;Google is making it easier to swap between user profiles in a new Chrome update that’s rolling out today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlhMGU"&gt;Chrome profiles are nothing new — you can currently swap between Google accounts; keep personalized extensions, apps, history, themes, and bookmarks for different users on shared computers; and sync those settings between devices as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2r8fck2ky4MHjYk1PBk7X7VxFUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339775/New_profile_experience_in_Chrome.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9nRp9a"&gt;Google is rolling out a “revamped” profile experience. Now, if you have multiple profiles set up, a “profile picker” will appear each time you restart Chrome, prompting you to select a user or browse as a guest. Chrome will also prompt you to switch profiles or create a new one “when you might benefit,” Google says. And finally, when you create a new profile, you’ll be able to choose its color with a single click. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkTEcQ"&gt;The new update also includes an expansion to Chrome’s Reading List feature, which was previously limited to the iOS app. Now, you can save articles to read later in the Android and desktop versions of Chrome as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2qTlj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WTez87"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EddDYw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SoundCloud will pay indie artists based on their actual listeners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ncyeLuDmFIogGIX3T7jqrqETB3E=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897482/soundcloud.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SRUT6N"&gt;SoundCloud’s trying something new for a major music streaming service: paying indie artists a share of their actual listeners’ subscription fees. The company &lt;a href="https://press.soundcloud.com/197001-soundcloud-introduces-fan-powered-royalties"&gt;calls this&lt;/a&gt; “fan-powered royalties,” and it means a SoundCloud subscriber’s subscription fee or advertising revenue will be divvied up among the artists they actually listen to, rather than going to a big pot and being split up among the platform’s most popular artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ86Fm"&gt;This is a major change for the industry and one indie artists have pushed for. Currently, most music streaming platforms reward the world’s biggest stars with the most royalties. At Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9533266/soundcloud-fan-powered-royalties-user-centric-payment-system/"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, the company figures out how many streams happened on its platform in a given country and then calculates what portion of those streams went to a specific artist. The result is that smaller artists, who might not have massive reach but also have a dedicated, loyal audience, end up not making much money because they represent a smaller portion of the overall streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNddNs"&gt;SoundCloud says today that its new system will change that. It &lt;a href="https://community.soundcloud.com/fanpoweredroyalties"&gt;specifically cites&lt;/a&gt; one musician who has 124,000 followers. With the old model, this artist made $120 a month, but with fan-powered royalties, he makes $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9x5Rj"&gt;For now, SoundCloud hasn’t worked out a deal with the three major record labels — Warner, Sony, or Universal — but it’s able to implement this model with the indie artists it directly monetizes through its &lt;a href="https://creators.soundcloud.com/premier"&gt;SoundCloud Premier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.repostnetwork.com/"&gt;Repost by SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt;, and Repost Select tiers. (These services make SoundCloud the distributor of the music, either only on SoundCloud or on other music streaming services, too.) The nearly 100,000 artists who participate in these programs will be the first to experience fan-based royalties. They’ll receive their first payouts after April 30th this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3ybBn"&gt;It’s unclear how SoundCloud will balance the royalties with its payouts of the major music labels or how it’ll divvy up a listener’s revenue. But for now, this feels experimental. If it’s successful, artists could advocate for more platforms to take this model on, and if it’s not, then the streaming platforms can continue with the status quo, possibly to the detriment of smaller artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIYi87"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Los Angeles’ creator community is starting to move out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oXpxw4Q-6vEIXsOtGOkSlDc9m2I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897436/acastro_210301_4456_LeavingLA_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Kyhvv"&gt;Logan and Jake Paul &lt;a href="https://www.thehairpin.com/2015/07/did-you-know-all-the-vine-stars-live-in-the-same-building-in-hollywood/"&gt;moved to Los Angeles in 2014&lt;/a&gt;, at the height of Vine’s heyday, and not long after found themselves crammed into &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/489227978790813696"&gt;an apartment at 1600 Vine Road&lt;/a&gt; with other young creators hoping to make it big in America’s entertainment epicenter. Over the next few years, they became world-renowned celebrities (often for the wrong reasons), moved into gigantic mansions, and threw the types of obnoxious parties high school kids worshipped and neighbors dreaded. Now, years after they both moved into their own mansions in the wealthiest part of the city, the brothers have independently decided to leave the place they’ve called home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e5NL2v"&gt;“I think I got the bug that’s bit everyone leaving LA,” Logan Paul said on his podcast, &lt;em&gt;Impaulsive&lt;/em&gt;, in February. “It’s the closing of one chapter and the beginning of a new one. There’s a lot of senior vibes around the house lately.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pOjCDw"&gt;They’re not the only ones, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kcloEr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7OnFSESMWF0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhehHK"&gt;YouTube is full of videos posted over the last several months of creators deciding to leave Los Angeles. Some are going back to cities and towns they grew up in to be closer to family. Others, like Logan, are finding entirely new places to live, like Puerto Rico. (Jake has yet to announce where he’s moving.) The exodus is similar to what’s happening in the tech sector, which is seeing employees at companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/technology/san-francisco-covid-work-moving.html"&gt;move away from San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; to set up life elsewhere. Even YouTubers have found that, without a daily routine and places to be, there’s no reason to stay in one of the most expensive cities in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="udF0sU"&gt;“We came here on our visa a year-and-a-half ago,” Jasmine Saini, a YouTuber who moved to Los Angeles from Toronto with her husband, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The first six months were great. Then the pandemic happened. We just realized there’s literally no point of us being here; we can’t go anywhere, we can’t meet with anybody, we can’t network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hyVBdw"&gt;Actors, directors, and writers have called Hollywood home for close to a century. But since the early 2010s, online creators have turned the city into their playground. Around 2014, the popularity of the shortform video app Vine helped convince a few future superstars to move to Los Angeles and start working with one another. Jake and Logan Paul (Ohio), David Dobrik (Chicago), Liza Koshy (Houston), Jenna Marbles (upstate New York), and other familiar names came together to collaborate and use the city to carve out their own space within the entertainment capital of the world. Certain areas, like the spot around Sunset and Vine — once referred to as Radio Row — attracted a sea of creators all hoping to become superstars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="19YBXI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTTay8bRWGs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bCQnfm"&gt;By 2017 and 2018, creators weren’t just roaming down the streets of Los Angeles with Sony and Canon cameras attached to their hands; they were buying mansions and moving other personalities into their homes. Clout Gang, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17351942/jake-paul-team-10-youtube"&gt;Team 10&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747357/david-dobrik-four-year-anniversary-youtube-vine-vlog-squad"&gt;the Vlog Squad&lt;/a&gt; all started turning their lives in Los Angeles into an ongoing show for the internet to watch. More people moved to Los Angeles trying to ride the wave of internet stardom that people like the Paul brothers found just a couple of years prior. Then came TikTok, and hype houses became a staple. The messaging was clear: to become a superstar creator, chances are, you’d have to move to LA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB173c"&gt;But over the past year, that’s changed. The pandemic has limited creators’ ability to collaborate, and going out to different locations to film — like a giant water park or hanging out with wild animals, anything that can be turned into an adventure — can be difficult. Creators say it’s removed their key reason to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOYsvI"&gt;“It closed down any opportunity to work in LA, it changed the social life of LA, which is so much of what you pay for, and it’s very expensive to live in LA,” Brian Redmon, a YouTuber who originally moved to LA for acting, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4tfhnmKV5ts"&gt;said in a November 2020 video&lt;/a&gt;. “I couldn’t hang out with my friends and so many of my friends were leaving LA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgrFSY"&gt;The feeling among some LA-based creators is similar to what many workers in the tech sector have been saying about why they’re leaving San Francisco for a remote-first life. Between March and November 2020, more than 80,000 people left San Francisco, &lt;a href="https://sfciti.org/sf-tech-exodus/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SFCiti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a 79 percent increase compared to the same period in the year prior. If there’s no office to go to every day, and working remotely works just as well, why spend the cash on expensive living arrangements away from family and friends?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fat003"&gt;Not everyone feels the same. James Rath was already contemplating leaving Los Angeles before the pandemic started and ultimately decided to move back home to be closer to family. But once everything is back to normal, he’s considering moving to New York City, which he thinks will be more accessible as a legally blind person. Ultimately, he still wants to be in a location with access to potential collaborators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn1WUH"&gt;“Creators have adapted very well in this new remote-working world, but I think there is a longing for in-person collaborations and as soon as it’s safe to do so, either creative will return to the city or new ones will emerge looking for the same opportunities as before,” Rath told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lWwqs4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-3yuHKRUXQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SD6gdA"&gt;Not everyone is leaving Los Angeles, of course. David Dobrik just bought a &lt;a href="https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/influencers/david-dobrik-house-sherman-oaks-1203333922/"&gt;$9.5 million mansion&lt;/a&gt; in Sherman Oaks. Los Angeles is still home to the entertainment industry, and there will eventually be a post-COVID world where things return to some form of normalcy. For people trying to break into the industry or find their place within that world, not being in Los Angeles can be career-ending. Almost every creator in videos watched by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;said the same thing: they could end up back in LA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQSvli"&gt;But for others, Los Angeles will always be a plane right away. Jasmine and Harjit Bhandal realized they could be home with their families in Toronto and fly out to LA when they needed to in a post-pandemic world. The decision to move was a little easier after three members of Harjit’s family came down with COVID-19, and two wound up really sick. With a built-in subscriber base and contacts already made in Los Angeles, this was the perfect time to go home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWxQ3u"&gt;“Collabs are happening less and less, and I feel like YouTube has definitely changed,” Jasmine said. “We’re paying a ridiculous amount of money for rent, where it’s just the two of us and our dogs. We don’t have anybody else. It just makes more sense to go home. Especially since everyone realized that you can really do anything online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDeOgX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87igot"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yywDTp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvY1Kl"&gt;Samsung has begun shipments of its 2021 TV lineup, which is is led by new &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/samsung-neo-qled-4k/75-qn85a-neo-qled-4k-smart-tv-2021-qn75qn85aafxza/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;“Neo QLED” 8K and 4K TVs&lt;/a&gt; that use Mini LED technology to achieve greater contrast and improved picture quality than in previous years. With Mini LED, the company is able to cram much smaller LEDs — and way, way more of them than before — into the TV’s backlighting system. This gives the TV much finer control over dimming zones and black levels, and it should dramatically cut down on any unwanted “blooming” effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBVa1S"&gt;This year’s upper-end Samsung TVs also include a number of gaming-centric features like a new settings bar that puts all the crucial next-gen options — refresh rate, aspect ratio, input lag, and so on — within easy reach. Many of the TVs will start reaching customers within the next two weeks, with others to follow in April and thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wBr1fs"&gt;The Frame, one of Samsung’s “lifestyle” TVs, is being refreshed with a thinner design and more bezel options for making it look like a piece of art on your wall. And Samsung now says it’s increasing the internal storage from 500MB to 6GB so that customers can now store more artwork — up to 1,200 ultra hi-res images — on the TV that is displayed when it’s not actively being used. Another lifestyle TV, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050604/samsung-sero-tv-rotate-vertical-video-tiktok-ces-2020"&gt;the rotating Sero&lt;/a&gt;, is picking up support for Apple’s AirPlay 2 in the near future. (Samsung promised this at the TV’s launch, but has taken some time to actually make it happen.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUCLC0"&gt;The company also announced it’s introducing more traditional form factors for its futuristic MicroLED TVs that aim to leapfrog OLED as the next great TV technology. Instead of offering modular, any-size-you-want options as it does with The Wall, Samsung will be selling the MicroLED set in 110-inch, 99-inch, and 88-inch sizes. Now it’s been announced that a 76-inch model will be added in the future. The 110-inch and 99-inch MicroLED TVs will be available in April. All of them are sure to be exorbitantly expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CeISA"&gt;Here’s how Samsung’s 2021 lineup shakes out in terms of pricing. I’m not about to recommend you get an 8K TV, though it’s unfortunate that the gorgeous, barely-there bezel design is reserved exclusively for the top-tier 8K series. I’m definitely eyeing one of the Neo QLED 4K sets — especially once sales start to kick in. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Outlook calendar board view looks a lot like Trello</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Sx08mcMuZaFx2IHunfJ6ns-rYo=/1x0:2446x1630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897264/outlookcalendarboardview.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Outlook calendar board view.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eXh8OQ"&gt;Microsoft is making its first significant change to the Outlook calendar view in years. A new Outlook calendar board view is coming soon to Outlook for the web, and it works a lot like Trello. It’s a new dynamic view that will let you organize meetings alongside tasks, notes, goals, links, files, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UjGUF"&gt;It works much like Trello, where you can add new cards of information to help you organize your calendar and meetings. Files can sit alongside this view or even simple notes and goals to help with organization. It’s essentially an ever-expanding board that tries to centralize everything that goes into keeping your calendar clean and up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MBOxOsuZiq17ZNFrooN4XQWefR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339565/outlookboardview.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Outlook calendar board looks a lot like Trello.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Sr3KU"&gt;“On average, people use 6 tools to track all the things they need to get done,” &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/outlook-blog/everyone-needs-some-extra-time/ba-p/2164356"&gt;says Gabriel Valdez&lt;/a&gt;, a product marketing manager for Microsoft’s Outlook team. “That is a lot of context switching, back and forth, and maybe even double tracking.” This new calendar board view is designed to help people cut down on having to switch between tools and apps to manage their time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jaE8J"&gt;Microsoft is making this new board calendar view available in Outlook for the web first, and it will be available to commercial and education users soon, too. It’s not clear how this new view will appear in Outlook for Windows or the mobile versions of Outlook in the future, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55B92P"&gt;Microsoft is also improving Outlook for iOS and Android for meeting scheduling. Later this month, suggested times for meetings will appear for all commercial and education users, making it easier to avoid conflicts when scheduling meetings with multiple participants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Aliens: Fireteam is a co-op shooter about surviving a Xenomorph attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OyRuVg7cUHOQ9gR1K8RWgHXof5Q=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68897145/Aliens__Fireteam_Screenshot10.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6iDMIo"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; video game will be cooperative. Today, developer Cold Iron Studios revealed &lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam&lt;/em&gt;, a multiplayer third-person shooter about surviving an onslaught of Xenomorphs set a few decades after the original &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VUDci"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fireteam&lt;/em&gt; is a class-based shooter — where players take on roles like gunner, demolisher, or technician — and Cold Iron says there will be a huge range of enemies to take on, including 11 types of Xenomorphs, as well as some of those pesky Weyland-Yutani synthetics. Here’s the basic premise:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TyoDlw"&gt;Set 23 years after the original &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, &lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam&lt;/em&gt; drops players into the role of a Colonial Marine aboard the USS &lt;em&gt;Endeavor&lt;/em&gt;, recently tasked with answering a distress call from the outer colonies. Deploy to overrun facilities, abandoned ruins, and strange alien landscapes as you battle terrifying enemies across four campaigns with two friends or AI teammates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="bix7ET"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B63_ljZ91Mc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZVhev"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; franchise has a mixed history in video games, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"&gt;2014’s &lt;em&gt;Alien: Isolation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is regarded as a high point. But whereas that game channeled the original &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; and its horror roots, &lt;em&gt;Fireteam&lt;/em&gt; is looking to evoke the action-heavy sequel, &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;. “This is the action game &lt;em&gt;Alien&lt;/em&gt; fans have been waiting for,” Cold Iron Studios head Craig Zinkievich said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyaeRy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aliens: Fireteam&lt;/em&gt; is expected to launch this summer on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and Steam.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 Plus review: built for business</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Removable SSDs, built-in LTE, and a familiar design&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xIz7VQ"&gt;You could now line up five years’ worth of Surface Pro devices next to each other and it would be all but impossible to tell them apart. Microsoft’s new Surface Pro 7 Plus keeps the same familiar design, which is likely just to satisfy corporate customers who want to standardize their hardware for years at a time. That might be good news for business customers, but for the rest of us who want slimmer display bezels and a more modern design like the Surface Pro X, then the wait continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLaB4k"&gt;It’s no surprise then that Microsoft is limiting sales of the Surface Pro 7 Plus exclusively to businesses and schools. Consumers won’t be able to purchase this from a store, and it’s really for businesses and schools looking to upgrade older machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtieZW"&gt;While I’ve bemoaned the current design of the Surface Pro for a couple of years now, there are some changes inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus that will appeal to many. Microsoft now offers built-in LTE on select models, and the SSD is now removable, much like the Surface Laptop 3 and Surface Pro X. Intel’s latest processors also promise better performance and battery life. It’s nearly everything you’d want from a Surface tablet in 2021, but I still wish it looked like a Surface Pro X with an Intel chip inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zt6kW5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10369398"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ggpzYz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10369401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDAYCP"&gt;The Surface Pro 7 Plus starts at $899.99, which is a $150 premium on the price of the Surface Pro 7. Thankfully, the base model is now the Intel Core i3 version, with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Microsoft has dropped the 4GB of RAM option for the Plus model. I’ve been testing a Core i5 model with 16GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and built-in LTE connectivity, which is a steep $1,649.99 before you add a keyboard or stylus. The cheapest option for LTE is the $1,149.99 model with a Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. Microsoft offers all 11 models in the classic silver option, but oddly the black version isn’t available with built-in LTE. You’ll also need a separate Surface Type Cover, and the business versions are priced at $159.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlGs9q"&gt;Overall, the hardware on the Surface Pro 7 Plus is almost identical to the Surface Pro 7. There’s the same 12.3-inch (2736 x 1824) touchscreen with its 3:2 aspect ratio, a single USB-C port, and the regular USB-A port. Microsoft still hasn’t made the switch to Thunderbolt 3 or 4 here, so you can’t hook this tablet up to an external GPU or use many of the Thunderbolt drives and docks available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWRQq0"&gt;The real changes to the Surface Pro 7 Plus can be found inside. Microsoft has moved to Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors, and you can pick between Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 variants. I’ve been testing the Core i5 model, and it has remained cool even when using heavy apps like video or video-editing software. Like other Core i5 Pro 7 models, this has no internal fan, so it’s also silent while working.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r3kotNhVimXSdmp-JOohyddMeU8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329291/twarren_210223_4439_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 has a familiar design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MbSDWy"&gt;These latest processors also include Intel’s Iris Xe graphics. While it’s not enough to turn this into a portable gaming laptop, it does help make the Surface Pro 7 Plus feel a lot snappier in a variety of tasks. Combined with improved SSD read and write speeds, lightweight photo and video editing is certainly faster than what I’m used to with the regular Surface Pro 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xgmtn7"&gt;The biggest new hardware addition is built-in LTE, though. It’s the first time the Surface Pro lineup has included this for a few years, but unfortunately there’s no 5G support. Microsoft is using Qualcomm’s older Snapdragon X20 LTE modem inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus. There’s a dedicated SIM slot at the side of the device, which replaces where you’d normally find the microSD slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ptic8A"&gt;As England has been in a pandemic lockdown for months, I haven’t ventured outside enough to really push the LTE connectivity to its limits, but I didn’t find it impacted battery life too much in my limited tests. LTE connectivity is a great option to have on a device like the Surface Pro, especially for those who normally work remotely, visit clients, or just want something to replace really bad Wi-Fi connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4v8wWeiE-cggYG8TZ-m5MdGe-q0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329296/twarren_210223_4439_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Surface Pro 7 Plus has removable SSDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4KPJ7E4N8JZzUK7KyAvZv6uyDPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329295/twarren_210223_4439_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s even a new SIM slot for built-in LTE connectivity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uX6vYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10369413"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3XiqKg"&gt;The other significant hardware change on the Surface Pro 7 Plus is removable SSDs. This is really designed for commercial users to swap out faulty SSDs or to retain corporate data. The SSD is easily accessible from an access door at the rear of the Surface Pro 7 Plus, and a simple SIM tool will open it up. Microsoft’s reseller network has &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/surface-it-pro-blog/introducing-ssd-commercial-spares-for-surface-pro-7/ba-p/2147128"&gt;started selling SSD kits&lt;/a&gt;, with 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options, so there’s even the option to upgrade storage space here. It’s encouraging to see Microsoft make this so easy to do, which makes it far quicker for IT admins to get a machine up and running again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSAHkg"&gt;All of these internal hardware changes also mean that Microsoft has managed to squeeze a bigger battery (46.5Wh to 50.4Wh) inside the Surface Pro 7 Plus. The company now promises 15 hours of battery life, compared to the 10.5 hours on the original Surface Pro 7. I haven’t noticed any drastic improvements in battery life during normal usage, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36a2Z6"&gt;I typically got around seven to eight hours of battery life during my testing, which includes a mix of apps ranging from Chrome, Discord, and Netflix to Adobe Photoshop. If all you’re doing is watching videos, then you’ll probably see closer to Microsoft’s 15-hour promise, but realistically this is still just enough to get you through a regular day of work. I’m still hoping that one day a Surface Pro will reliably hit 10 hours, so I never have to worry about traveling without a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-9rT_ZPMxIsCob_M0RwR0Hn7d60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22329293/twarren_210223_4439_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 7 Plus is only available to businesses and schools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="52OAPW"&gt;I’m still a big fan of the Surface Pro, despite the lack of design changes. Microsoft is clearly catering to a specific audience here, and the Surface Pro 7 Plus has been built for businesses. I hope that means we’ll soon see a consumer-focused Surface Pro that mixes everything that’s great about the Surface Pro X with the power and performance of Intel’s chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2N6n6a"&gt;Built-in LTE and removable SSDs are great additions to the Surface Pro lineup, but we’ve still been waiting years for basics like Thunderbolt 3 support. And while LTE is a great option to have once again, it’s odd that Microsoft isn’t including more futureproof 5G connectivity. If you’re using an older Surface Pro and looking to upgrade, it might not look like a lot has changed over the years, but these subtle hardware changes do make a small difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="V6J4jn"&gt;Microsoft completely redesigned the inside of the Surface Pro this year to include this LTE support and removable SSDs. I’m just hoping a complete redesign on the outside is on the way. It’s still the 2-in-1 to beat, but the Surface Pro could offer so much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qS7icW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOIoeu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9VpFPT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiUK04"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to import your passwords to Chrome and the Google Password Manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6P7a_up-tHjfUvAKkTjmeuuzAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896888/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6H1EGD"&gt;If you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"&gt;moving from LastPass&lt;/a&gt; (or another password manager you’re dissatisfied with), you may be tempted to simply go with the password manager that comes with your browser or operating system. It’s certainly an easy solution, and a reasonable one, depending on your point of view. Until recently, third-party password managers were known to be more secure, but Apple and Google have been working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21299007/google-password-checkup-security"&gt;make their built-in password managers more secure&lt;/a&gt;, while Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;adding one to its authenticator app&lt;/a&gt;. So it could be a viable choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIrfb8"&gt;One way, however, that these built-in password managers don’t stand up to their independent competitors is how tricky it can be to get preexisting passwords into their systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUIylU"&gt;If you tend to hang out in the Google ecosystem and / or you have an Android mobile device, that means you can be using the Google Password Manager to store and synch your passwords via the Chrome browser. Unfortunately, like Apple’s Safari, Google Chrome makes it extremely difficult to import passwords from a CSV file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="O2F5EW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to import your passwords to Apple’s iCloud Keychain via Safari","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22301046/passwords-import-how-to-keychain-safari-apple-lastpass"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oKDU7F"&gt;The only way to do it that I could find was to try to enable a disabled Chrome feature that allows you to import passwords. After searching online, I found several methods to enable it, depending on which version of Chrome you’re running. I am currently running version 88, and while I was able to use the following method to add the import command to Chrome (&lt;a href="https://www.guidingtech.com/import-passwords-csv-google-chrome/"&gt;thank you to &lt;em&gt;Guiding Tech&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for pointing me toward this possible solution), my copy of Chrome was never able to actually import the CSV file I had downloaded from LastPass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTWCMh"&gt;Be that as it may, here is the process I used. Perhaps you’ll have more luck. I’ll let you know how I finally managed to get my passwords into Chrome right afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VvVbcT"&gt;In Chrome’s top address bar, type in chrome://flags. This will bring you to the Experiments page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f9dtFh"&gt;In the “Search flags” box on top, type in “password import.” (Probably just typing “password” will be enough.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Chrome’s Experiments page, you can enable the Import feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RHFD7GIsWY6-p5jp3Nt1YvWJPT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337454/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_2.56.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Chrome’s Experiments page, you can enable the Import feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9zjeM"&gt;Find “Password import” and click on the drop-down menu on the left (it will probably be labeled “Default”). Select “Enabled.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xDXe7D"&gt;Select “Relaunch.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwDwHmh8o06yhuZgrCTpcc9wnBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337453/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_2.56.52_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vV3KsE"&gt;Now that you’ve added the import function, go to to your Chrome Settings (by selecting the three dots in the upper right corner and choosing “Settings”). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vDiKwL"&gt;Find “Passwords” (which will be in the “Autofill” category) and click on the arrow on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xLC1Ge"&gt;Look for “Saved Passwords,” and click on the three dots on the right. You should see a drop-down that includes the selection “Import.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chrome should now have an Import selection under Saved Passwords" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NqZ35oLiyL2wS1oRrFN0OXDOthk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337560/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_3.32.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome should now have an Import selection under Saved Passwords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="VksRQg"&gt;Click on “Import.” You’ll be able to select a CSV file from your file manager — and hopefully, import your passwords.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="6fbrrx"&gt;If that works for you — great! If not, then there is a last desperate way to get your passwords into Chrome, which is the one that finally worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CFEYLv"&gt;Download Firefox (if you don’t have it already) and start it up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Er87a4"&gt;Click on the three lines in the upper right corner and select “Logins and Passwords.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3dWPXr"&gt;Click on the three dots in the upper right corner and select “Import from a File.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y1Lysz"&gt;Select your CSV file and import it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Firefox has no qualms about importing a CSV password file" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaBNvwODilDQLjVRTcaQ9oijBqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337610/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_3.38.07_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefox has no qualms about importing a CSV password file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="930KB9"&gt;Now that your passwords are in Firefox, you can transfer them easily to Chrome:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rmNvOf"&gt;In Chrome, click on the three dots in the upper right corner and go to “Bookmarks” &amp;gt; “Import Bookmarks and Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5MJBqE"&gt;Select Mozilla Firefox in the drop-down menu, select “Passwords” (and “Autofill form data” if you had any), and click on “Import.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Chrome has no problem importing passwords from rival browsers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5Znuv5s85vZbOPIC_KDLDZzXVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22337615/Screen_Shot_2021_03_01_at_3.43.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrome has no problem importing passwords from rival browsers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7jwnMI"&gt;That (phew!) should do it! But if you don’t want to go through all that, there are always free alternative password managers that you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RI2EEm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Six free alternatives to the LastPass password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22285499/password-manager-lastpass-free-bitwarden-zoho"},{"title":"How to leave LastPass and move to another password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295354/lastpass-export-delete-bitwarden-1password-zoho"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
