    <title>LG is shutting down its phone business by July 31st</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6TTSk0"&gt;LG is exiting the smartphone business, the company confirmed today. The decision will “enable the company to focus resources in growth areas such as electric vehicle components, connected devices, smart homes, robotics, artificial intelligence and business-to-business solutions, as well as platforms and services,” LG said in a &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/04/lg-to-close-mobile-phone-business-worldwide/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Xy9US"&gt;Existing phones will remain on sale, and LG says it’ll continue to support its products “for a period of time which will vary by region.” The company hasn’t said anything about possible layoffs except that “details related to employment will be determined at the local level.” LG says it expects to have completed the business’ closure by the end of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ueOwC"&gt;The move has been rumored for several months, following the division’s huge losses over the past five years. Once considered a rival to fellow South Korean manufacturer Samsung, LG’s recent high-end smartphones have struggled to compete, while its more affordable handsets have faced stiff competition from Chinese rivals. The company had previously said it hoped to make its smartphone division &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/9/21058238/lg-smartphone-profitable-2021-apple-samsung-ces-mwc"&gt;profitable in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="moPpjV"&gt;Today’s news means LG’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436954/lg-extendable-sliding-phone-teaser-explorer-project-wing-mobile"&gt;long-teased rollable phone&lt;/a&gt; is unlikely to ever see the light of day. The last time the company showed off the device was back at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224591/lg-rollable-phone-extending-display-teaser-ces-2021"&gt;this year’s virtual CES&lt;/a&gt; when the company insisted that the device was real and would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226532/lgs-rollable-phone-launch-release-date-ces-2021"&gt;launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UbwMax"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An attempt to sell the division reportedly failed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bt7zVh"&gt;Reports that LG has been considering exiting smartphones have been around since at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240282/lg-smartphone-business-exit-2021-internal-memo"&gt;the beginning of this year&lt;/a&gt;. Although a company spokesperson branded an earlier report about the company’s potential exit from the smartphone business “&lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/01/15/no-lg-isnt-exiting-the-smartphone-business/"&gt;completely false and without merit,&lt;/a&gt;” an LG official later &lt;a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210120000992"&gt;confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Korea Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;company had to make “a cold judgment” about the division. Potential measures could include “sale, withdrawal and downsizing of the smartphone business,” the official said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7TzZp"&gt;In March, reports emerged that the company had tried to find a buyer for its smartphone business, but that talks had stalled and it could instead shut down the division. &lt;a href="https://www.donga.com/news/article/all/20210321/106003359/1"&gt;Korean outlet &lt;em&gt;DongA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said the company had ceased development of its upcoming phones with rollable displays, and that it had shelved its planned smartphones for the first half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnmaa"&gt;As it lost share to rivals, LG released a series of eye-catching devices with unusual form-factors. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536659/lg-wing-review-dual-screen-price-specs-features"&gt;LG Wing&lt;/a&gt;, whose main display rotated to reveal a smaller secondary screen beneath it, or its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939655/lg-g8x-thinq-dual-screen-review"&gt;dual screen&lt;/a&gt; devices. LG also tried its hand at a modular smartphone with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;LG G5&lt;/a&gt;, only to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/8/11391826/lg-g5-review-friend-modules-android"&gt;abandon the initiative a year later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VG07jS"&gt;Unfortunately for LG, none of these features were useful enough to turn the phones into mainstream hits, and meanwhile the company’s more traditional handsets fell behind their rivals in core areas like camera performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEkq67"&gt;LG joins a long list of high-profile device makers to give up on smartphones over the years, although many of the brand names have stuck around on devices made by third-party manufacturers. Nokia’s consumer-facing brand lives on atop handsets made by HMD, while Blackberry’s branding was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;initially used by TCL&lt;/a&gt; and is set to return this year on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375026/5g-blackberry-phone-android-physical-keyboard-2021-release-date"&gt;device made by OnwardMobility&lt;/a&gt;. There’s also HTC, which still sells a few oddball handsets but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16340108/google-htc-smartphone-team-acquisition-announced"&gt;sold most of its IP to Google in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Who’s next?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genesis drone show used a record-breaking 3,281 drones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/434xFRBnr7cyme9pdj0DQ49etek=/211x0:2490x1519/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075245/image1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Genesis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="J3hpGc"&gt;Hyundai’s luxury vehicle brand Genesis used 3,281 drones to create its logo over Shanghai’s skyline on March 29th in celebration of the brand’s arrival in China. That number of drones sets a new Guinness World Record for “The Most Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) airborne simultaneously,” &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/genesis-celebrates-launch-in-china-with-dazzling-world-record-breaking-drone-show-over-shanghais-iconic-skyline-301261643.html"&gt;according to a Genesis press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugoT6E"&gt;You can see a picture of the Genesis logo formation at the top of this post. Genesis also made a video that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ead2Efblvxk"&gt;showed off some additional drone formations&lt;/a&gt;, including a hand, two of the company’s cars, and... a double helix? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OCV7cW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ead2Efblvxk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KbhfZV"&gt;Genesis’ record edges out the previous one held by Shenzhen Damoda Intelligent Control Technology, which used 3,051 drones in a display on September 20th. &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/44KvHwRHb3A"&gt;Here’s a video of that display&lt;/a&gt;, which I personally think is even more impressive than Genesis’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nW1IpZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/44KvHwRHb3A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M9bKps"&gt;Intel held the record at one point as well, using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/9/16994638/winter-olympics-2018-intel-drone-show-world-record"&gt;1,218 Shooting Star drones&lt;/a&gt; to create the Olympic rings over Pyeongchang for the 2018 Winter Olympics. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tencent-owned studio behind Call of Duty: Mobile reportedly earned $10 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7-0H-GxUrLNW0eqrbK9rbZEA0A=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69075061/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_2.11.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L4jX9l"&gt;TiMi Studios, the Tencent-owned developer of huge mobile hits &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and the MOBA &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings, &lt;/em&gt;earned a staggering $10 billion in revenue in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-exclusive-idUSKBN2BP0FG"&gt;according to an April 1st &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="490xCa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;’ article says those earnings make TiMi the “world’s largest developer,” according to its sources. While it’s unclear exactly what metric that is defining, it’s a undoubtably a huge number. For comparison, Activision Blizzard (which publishes the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise) &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2020-financial"&gt;posted 2020 revenues of $8.09 billion&lt;/a&gt;, nearly $2 billion &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; than TiMi’s reported $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1aWxPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;TiMi’s games are some of the biggest in the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEjgq5"&gt;While TiMi might not be a household name, its games are some of the biggest in the world. &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Mobile&lt;/em&gt; reportedly had the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"&gt;biggest mobile game launch ever&lt;/a&gt; when it released in October 2019, racking up over 100 million downloads worldwide in its first week of availability. And &lt;em&gt;Honor of Kings&lt;/em&gt;, which is only available in China, had an astounding 100 million &lt;em&gt;daily &lt;/em&gt;active users as of November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tencent-videogames-honorofkings/tencents-honor-of-kings-reports-100-million-daily-users-expands-into-new-genres-idUSKBN27H1HX"&gt;according to Tencent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0F4qf"&gt;It doesn’t seem like Tencent and TiMi will be resting on their laurels. TiMi is recruiting for a new AAA game that “resembles the virtual community from the movie &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;,” &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports, which seems to suggest TiMi wants to make its own metaverse-like game in the vein of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578491/roblox-ipo-announced-dau-increase-pandemic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Tencent is also building a TiMi studio in Los Angeles, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEjDRn"&gt;Tencent has long-standing investments in some US-based gaming companies. It bought a &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2011/02/04/chinas-tencent-acquires-majority-stake-in-online-game-firm-riot-games-for-more-than-350m/"&gt;majority stake&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games in 2011 and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent"&gt;full ownership&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. And Tencent purchased &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition"&gt;40 percent of Epic Games in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, a stake that grown in value significantly following the huge success of Epic’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nYNS4"&gt;Tencent is also&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the owner of the studio Lightspeed &amp;amp; Quantum, which develops &lt;em&gt;PUBG: Mobile. &lt;/em&gt;That game has also been a smash hit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"&gt;just crossed more than 1 billion downloads worldwide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="rS8lFP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PUBG Mobile has been downloaded more than 1 billion times","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350782/pubg-mobile-one-billion-downloads-tencent"},{"title":"Call of Duty is the biggest mobile game launch ever, with 100 million downloads","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Black Widow, Rick and Morty, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O10C9Kvo-F3l9T2KdCdmSSKOL2o=/159x0:1353x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69074755/Screen_Shot_2021_04_04_at_11.24.39_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bejVwo"&gt;Hi, it’s Jay, and I’m holding down the fort for Kim today, which means I get to do a trailer roundup. I apparently picked a good week to take this responsibility, as there were &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of good trailers to pick from — it seems like media companies are gearing up for a big year in movies and TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfO4MV"&gt;Let’s get right into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iD007H"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fp9pNPdNwjI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="40Vuw8"&gt;Black Widow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7bFes4"&gt;My wife and I spent the first part of this year watching the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and as we got further along, we couldn’t believe that Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow didn’t have her own movie yet. So as you might expect, we’re very excited to see &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, especially after &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp9pNPdNwjI"&gt;the new trailer&lt;/a&gt; that came out on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZv1gD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; will debut &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;on July 9th in theaters and on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; as a $30 Premiere Access title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JqiuQD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vBumm7mYT_0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QI6C0x"&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R0oCgB"&gt;Speaking of superhero films (or in this case, I guess antiheroes), Warner Bros. released &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vBumm7mYT_0"&gt;a second trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; less than a week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352484/the-suicide-squad-trailer-james-gunn-hbo-max"&gt;after debuting the first one&lt;/a&gt;. The film, helmed by &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; director James Gunn, is packed with an all-star cast, including Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn, Idris Elba as Bloodsport, and even Sylvester Stallone as a giant CGI shark-man named King Shark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ0DMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; premieres in theaters and on HBO Max on August 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="soTYDz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6Zy_mLgSNQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EFkqYs"&gt;Rick and Morty season 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FpU1NR"&gt;I’m just going to be totally honest here: despite &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; being a constant thing on the internet and also being something that looks totally up my alley, I have never seen a single episode and know basically nothing about it. But if you’ve been looking forward to season five, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6Zy_mLgSNQ"&gt;an official trailer hit this week&lt;/a&gt;. The new season premieres on Adult Swim on June 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

I actually just got the first book in the series from the library, and I’m looking forward to reading it ahead of &lt;em&gt;Shadow and Bone’s&lt;/em&gt; premiere on April 23rd. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Mars rover drops off Ingenuity helicopter ahead of historic flight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3JkHOCTrdhrNnEnog65QHs9Y7U=/0x0:926x617/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69074501/EyF2yf7WUAMSUdR.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lWnmmf"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover, which is currently roaming around Mars, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1378513754241961985"&gt;has dropped&lt;/a&gt; off the mini helicopter Ingenuity ahead of the four-pound aircraft’s historic first flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8lsie"&gt;Ingenuity dropped four inches from the belly of Perseverance to the surface of Mars. While four inches might not seem like a very big drop, getting Ingenuity to successfully stick the landing is still a significant milestone, as the helicopter had to go through a multi-day process of flipping from a horizontal position on the rover to a vertical position before it was set down. (It also had to survive a seven-month trip through space to get to Mars. NBD.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OVQchY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; touchdown confirmed! Its 293 million mile (471 million km) journey aboard &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt; ended with the final drop of 4 inches (10 cm) from the rover's belly to the surface of Mars today. Next milestone? Survive the night. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE"&gt;https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XaBiSNebua"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XaBiSNebua&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1378513754241961985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6mmMVl"&gt;Now that Ingenuity is separated from Perseverance, it will need to power and heat itself. Ingenuity will draw power from the sun using its onboard solar panels, but its heater will have the tough job of keeping the helicopter warm through the freezing cold nights on Mars, where temperatures can go as low as negative 130 degrees Fahrenheit, &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/288/its-cold-on-mars/"&gt;according to Bob Balaram, Ingenuity’s chief engineer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpoIl6"&gt;Presuming Ingenuity survives the harsh conditions, the helicopter will aim to take the first powered flight on another planet, which is currently set for “no earlier” than April 11th. NASA outlined the helicopter’s flight zone, which NASA outlined &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;on March 23rd&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is for Ingenuity to attempt as many as five test flights within 30 days before settling down on the surface of Mars for eternity. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Personal data of 533 million Facebook users leaks online </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HiErB6jnaTJVnq84kPOd2q-9sqQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69074338/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tzt1xO"&gt;Personal data from 533 million Facebook accounts has reportedly leaked online for free, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378314424239460352"&gt;security researcher Alon Gal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=DE&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; said it verified&lt;/a&gt; several of the leaked records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zxF8r"&gt;“The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India,” according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMaCH2"&gt;If that 533 million number might sound familiar to you, that’s because this information is apparently from the same dataset that people could pay for portions of using a Telegram bot, which &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz7bd/facebook-phone-numbers-bot-telegram"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported on in January&lt;/a&gt;. Now, though, it appears that those who want to get their hands on the data won’t have to pay anything at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa0XL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Details include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phone number, Facebook ID, Full name, Location, Past Location, Birthdate, (Sometimes) Email Address, Account Creation Date, Relationship Status, Bio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad actors will certainly use the information for social engineering, scamming, hacking and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;— Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378315550103863298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgsrQj"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that this data was scraped because of a vulnerability that it fixed in 2019. The company gave a similar answer to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; in January. “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019,” &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-leaked-on-hacker-forum/"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.” Facebook has not replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZjYUy"&gt;Troy Hunt, the creator of the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned database&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378632650538188802"&gt;said on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that “I haven’t seen anything yet to suggest this breach isn’t legit.” In the data, he found only about 2.5 million unique email addresses (which is still a lot!), but apparently, “the greatest impact here is the phone numbers.” Here’s what that might mean, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485540425670657"&gt;in Hunt’s words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LDNsOV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;But for spam based on using phone number alone, it's gold. Not just SMS, there are heaps of services that just require a phone number these days and now there's hundreds of millions of them conveniently categorised by country with nice mail merge fields like name and gender.&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485999781613569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDRN6t"&gt;If you can, I strongly recommend taking a couple minutes to read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378463581604220931"&gt;Hunt’s full Twitter thread about the breach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGZkM2"&gt;Hunt has already loaded the leaked email addresses into &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you can check to see if yours was included as part of the dataset. He is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378632650538188802"&gt;still considering&lt;/a&gt; whether or not to make the leaked phone numbers available through the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Ok5w0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Should the FB phone numbers be searchable in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;? I’m thinking through the pros and cons in terms of the value it adds to impacted people versus the risk presented if it’s used to help resolve numbers to identities (you’d still need the source data to do that).&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378503918284460035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The visual jazz of Genesis Noir</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-iev1JXpAWFsAswkyEcWm_ACYg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69073896/GenesisNoir_MissMass.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pz6uhH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; is set at the start of existence, reimagining the Big Bang and the natural expansion of the universe as the violent end result of a love triangle gone wrong. It’s a marriage of jazz and film noir in a point-and-click adventure game that sometimes works better as an audiovisual plaything than it does a series of puzzles. But &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyvOoCZyWRQ"&gt;the game’s visual style&lt;/a&gt; is a clear standout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eahC4Q"&gt;The monochromatic, abstract, line-drawn look that makes &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; so unique comes from a host of influences: classic film, Italian literature, other indie games. The real mystery to solve was combining those ideas in a way that makes sense — and it actually ended in a playable game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0uiUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Evan Anthony’s jumping-off point was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicomics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cosmicomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of science-inspired short stories by Italian author Italo Calvino. “I think just initially I was trying to translate what I was envisioning when I was reading that book,” Anthony tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Calvino’s writing, even in the translation to English is “very visually rich storytelling,” Anthony says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkrLUT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/26397024?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4fwKWp"&gt;Those ideas started solidifying into a style when Anthony and technical lead Jeremy Abel saw &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F26397024&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F4%2F22364576%2Fgenesis-noir-adventure-game-jazz-black-and-white-visuals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umbro Blackout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Made by &lt;a href="https://buck.co/"&gt;Buck&lt;/a&gt;, a creative studio specializing in animation, &lt;em&gt;Umbro Blackout&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a soccer player visiting New York during the blackout of 1977. “It’s just very simple black-and-white graphics. I wanted to bring that kind of clever transitions and juxtaposition of settings and scenes into an interactive space,” Anthony remembers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPHfVv"&gt;The actual genesis of &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir &lt;/em&gt;started&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on newsprint paper. Anthony and Abel sketched the early character designs that would become &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir’&lt;/em&gt;s initial trio of film noir archetypes — turned “gods” in the language of the game — in charcoal. They’d go on to become No-Man, the player character and a manifestation of Time; Miss Mass, a jazz singer femme fatale and representation of gravity; and Golden Boy, a star saxophonist and sort of creator god whose attempt to murder Miss Mass sets off the events of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeybuB"&gt;Indie games served as guidance for Anthony and Abel as well, neither of whom had a background in games or designed a level before. You can find some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083368/kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review-pc-switch-ps4-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kentucky Route Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt;’s interactions, fixed perspectives, and transitions between scenes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642356/kids-game-android-iphone-steam-double-fine-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the short film / video game hybrid from 2019, was also a big north star for doing a lot with a little. “[&lt;em&gt;Kids&lt;/em&gt;] was definitely a great reference in like what you could do with one asset,” Anthony says. “Like how we can be economical, very economical with the assets that we have,” Abel continues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Time and memories repeat in &lt;/em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;em&gt; — infinitely. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uils72"&gt;Even though both Abel and Anthony had embarked on some ambitious creative projects before — notably, &lt;a href="http://jeremyabel.com/portfolio/google-maps-pinball/"&gt;a Google Maps pinball machine&lt;/a&gt; for Google — the visuals of &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; were a different beast. They realized that game engines aren’t really designed with hyper-stylized visuals in mind. “There’s a reason why games don’t really look like this,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhlkjQ"&gt;Some of that difficulty admittedly came from the pair’s inexperience and the abstract direction they decided to take the game. One early level called “Seeding,” set in the first microseconds of the Big Bang, had to be reworked multiple times from Anthony’s initial idea of a level made from “vibrating lines and strings.” Creating a level of wobbling lines that could not only run, but players would actually want to explore, was a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planting seeds in the first microseconds of the Big Bang.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IhClae"&gt;According to Abel, the biggest technical considerations they had to manage were performance and translating the art Anthony was creating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208190/adobe-flash-is-dead"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; to the game’s engine. On some platforms like the Switch, that meant adapting and faking some visual effects. For the 2D animations themselves, Abel also had to create more bespoke solutions. “I worked with a friend of mine to develop a solution to actually export all the animations from Flash and draw them as vector art in the engine,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZwZ7C"&gt;Anthony and Abel’s multiyear journey to create &lt;em&gt;Genesis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Noir&lt;/em&gt; provided them with some valuable lessons in design and a delightful finished product.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you don’t relate to the variety of sources &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; is pulling from, playing the game really captures the feeling of an interactive animated film. And the goal of expressing big, abstract concepts with a familiar genre and setting pays dividends, too. I won’t spoil where &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; goes in its final levels, but there’s more here than science facts and noir story beats. “I think my goal was to find some poetry between comparing two very disparate things,” Anthony says. “I’m very happy with how everyone’s perceived it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWD9ny"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available now on PC, Xbox Game Pass, and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmdVZR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s latest Gram 17 makes a stellar case for 17-inch laptops</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More good stuff, same light weight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nrSiVY"&gt;I’ve read plenty about what it’s like to use, hold, and type on an LG Gram before, but that didn’t take away from the impressive first impression it made when I used the new Gram 17 for the first time — especially this larger model. The Gram 17 has a grandiose 17-inch display, yet it’s only three pounds, which is light enough for me to carry around one-handed. Its keyboard is a joy to type on with a surprising amount of tactility and travel in the keys, and the battery life outlasts a whole day of work, even much of a second one, too. It’s a quiet laptop, and even under pressure, its fans weren’t loud enough for me to hear once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRW2rK"&gt;The Gram communicates its biggest selling points — lightness and longevity — &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;effectively that it outshines some persisting minor problems. Those include a keyboard layout that can be difficult to adjust to. For instance, the num lock is too easy to press accidentally, being right next to backspace, and the only function key is located too far away from the most essential function row buttons, making it a stretch to adjust the volume one-handed. Lastly, the large trackpad isn’t always good at palm rejection. These are important things for any laptop to get right, let alone one that has a bunch of extra real estate that should be used to avoid flaws like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4suZ2k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10426094"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsxyAh"&gt;This new model for 2021 is mostly a spec update, not a design overhaul compared to the 2020 version. But it’s a good update, at that. Inside of LG’s sole $1,799 Gram 17 configuration (it’s been available for $1,699 since late March), there’s now an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor that promises — and actually delivers — better performance and longer battery life than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"&gt;the 2020 model my colleague Monica Chin reviewed&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, this model’s faster 4,266MHz LPDDR4X RAM, of which it has 16GB, likely plays a role in that speed boost. It’s not a drastically different computer to use than before, but it can hold its own more reliably this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIEimWOnP5ErqlcRDoTwQucHQcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411711/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG packed in a lot of keys here, but it’s not as logically laid out as it could be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1r1PpW-MKtRNmU0AkgOtCBg-80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411719/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen’s large size and 16:10 aspect ratio give content a lot of room to breathe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4KZGFe"&gt;While running my usual collection of around 10 tabs in Microsoft Edge for work, with Slack and Spotify running in tandem, performance didn’t stutter at all. This is the bare minimum of competency tests for laptops, so for something more demanding, I exported a five-minute, 33-second test file from our &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;video team through Adobe Premiere Pro. Last year’s model took 30 minutes to do this, but this one gets it done in around 11 minutes. That doesn’t hold a candle to laptops that put more of an emphasis on power usually at the expense of heft, but it’s enough of an improvement to make the Gram 17’s price a little easier to justify. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer’s Book 13&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor fared just about a minute faster with this test, but the Gram is on par with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="O7Bw2F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10426049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDFcr3"&gt;The battery is also mystifyingly good — and better than before. With that same batch of apps I mentioned earlier, the Gram 17 lasted an entire workday and well into the next, around 12 or so hours later. If you’re looking for a laptop that can go a full day of work without its charger, whether you have video calls or not, this is one for your shortlist. It features the same 80Wh battery as last year’s model, which is still impressive considering the Gram 17’s lightweight profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2ZRTY"&gt;Also similar to the 2020 version is its USB-C charging. LG now includes a 65W USB-C power adapter instead of the 48W charger that shipped with the previous model. It can more quickly recharge with the included brick (which is no bigger than a compact power bank), but it still takes a few hours to refill it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgmvLS"&gt;That sums up the biggest changes to this year’s Gram 17. There are a few smaller tweaks I liked, too. The arrangement of ports has been shifted around in a more logical layout. On the left side, there’s a Thunderbolt 4 port (it can be used for charging, data, or connecting to a display), one USB-C 4.0 Gen 3 port, a headphone combo jack, and an HDMI port. Over on the right is where you’ll find two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports next to a microSD card slot and a Kensington lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Thunderbolt 4 port, USB-C 4.0 port, headphone jack, and HDMI port are on the left side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the right side, the Gram 17 has two USB Type-A ports and a microSD card slot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NaLLSO"&gt;If you’re shopping around for 17-inch laptops, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything lighter than the Gram. It’s 2.98 pounds, which is just a little heavier than the 13-inch MacBook Air. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt; is one of LG’s main competitors in this space, yet its baseline model weighs over a pound and a half more. If you get an XPS 17 model like the one we reviewed in July 2020, it’ll weigh almost as much as two Gram 17s at 5.53 pounds. That added weight does bring more power and a dedicated GPU in the Dell, but if you just want a big, portable screen for productivity, the Gram is more than capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMl6yk"&gt;As my colleague Monica Chin mentioned in her review of the 2020 LG Gram 17, this laptop isn’t a looker. It still doesn’t stack up next to the high-end design of the XPS 17, which features an aluminum chassis. The Gram has a tough magnesium alloy-clad body, but it looks and feels plasticky. That said, there’s technically nothing flawed about its design, and it seems better than most black aluminum laptops I’ve tried at resisting fingerprints. Some people might actually prefer that its design doesn’t stick out much, even when its backlit keyboard is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="JxVTDj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Goodbye and good riddance to the 16:9 aspect ratio ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button works as intended consistently.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 720p webcam produces a fuzzy image, but it’s serviceable quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZHdHB"&gt;Something minor that I wish LG offered with this model is the option for a matte display. It’s rare for ultrabooks to have them, but I find it hard to stay focused on what’s happening on the screen when I can see a reflection of all my apartment’s happenings staring back at me. Wherever you use this laptop, glare could be a big problem, like it can be with a TV. This doesn’t take away from the Gram 17’s display being sharp and vivid. It’s a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS non-touch panel from the company’s own display division, and it makes everything look excellent with 99 percent DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. If a touchscreen is important to you, LG’s Gram 2-in-1 laptops feature them. LG was one of the first Windows laptop makers to move to a 16:10 aspect ratio, and the Gram 17 has one, too. It gives you a little more vertical real estate to work with on the screen compared to 16:9 displays. It’s most beneficial for productivity (you see more info at once, so less scrolling is necessary), but you’ll have black letterboxing for most full-screen videos you watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8SE7y"&gt;The Gram is short on bloatware, which I love to see. It ships with Amazon’s Alexa built-in, though it requires activation before you can use the service. A few other preinstalled apps include McAfee LiveScan and a suite of creator tools from CyberLink. Compared to some other laptops I’ve used recently, like Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE, the Gram doesn’t shove pop-up notifications in your face seemingly every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I7aSxJQnZ95qQoKiXNhlIh2PDXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411715/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have a 1.6mm travel and feel tactile to type on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_6RILWU4VY2U4LGX1Oazof_F5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411708/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design of the Gram doesn’t stand out, but some people might like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykJ77R"&gt;There are few 17-inch laptops to choose from and even fewer models that are as lightweight as this one. This year’s LG Gram 17 is unique in the sense that it’s more powerful than ever, but it doesn’t give up its portability. Oddly enough, the only competition it faces at the moment comes from within LG. The 16-inch Gram is lighter and less expensive, yet it features the same design, screen size, port selection, battery capacity, and specs (aside from having significantly less storage) for $1,399. You can find one that has the same 1TB storage as the Gram 17 for $1,599. If the Gram 17’s $1,799 price is too expensive, at least you have an alternative that’ll likely deliver the same great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYHXn"&gt;But if the price isn’t an issue and you want a surprisingly portable and powerful laptop with an oversized screen, the Gram 17 is in a class of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4plfai"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10426073"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Hummer’s new electric SUV can drive diagonally, with 300 miles of range and a $110,000 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6Njh_wOktyCwVK7JEuiufSpAnI=/99x0:1169x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072830/hummer_ev_reveal_suv_gal_my23_hummer_suv_VP33__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVTAkg"&gt;Hummer has unveiled the SUV version of its electric pickup truck, which comes with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;up to 300 miles of range and will sell for a suggested retail price of up to $110,595 for its first edition. Reservations for that model are already full, according &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev"&gt;to GM’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnjmLm"&gt;GM, which is producing the electric Hummers under its GMC brand, said the SUV will go into production starting early 2023, with less pricey variants starting at $90,000 in the spring of 2023 and a low-end $80,000 variant with a 250-mile range in the spring of 2024.  Previously, the company said that its electric pickup truck will start assembly at the end of 2021, starting with the most expensive trim level. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJJZ7S5FtPxqFK9zifiZoLlIFEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419232/hummer_ev_suv.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2CfLQb"&gt;Like the pickup, the SUV’s $90K-and-up trim levels come with Crab Walk, which can let the Hummer rotate all four wheels to drive diagonally at low speeds, and Extract Mode, which can use the air suspension system to lift the entire vehicle six inches off the ground to get over large obstacles. It’s also got the same 13.4-inch touchscreen center console display, and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woCOjPpT-MJKTaZJ6lDyNTySs-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419199/hummer_ev_suv_trim_levels.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hummer EV SUV trim levels; you can find a more detailed comparo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/suvs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;at GM’s site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4gEMMP"&gt;GM retired the Hummer brand in 2010. At the time, the boxy behemoth had become a symbol for pre-financial-crisis excess that was made famous by its inclusion in rap videos and television shows like &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Entourage&lt;/em&gt;. But once the global recession hit, and fuel prices stared to rise, Hummer sales dropped and the vehicle was discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4UEGc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10428065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spFypm"&gt;Last year, the company announced it was reviving the nameplate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;as an outrageous, 1,000 horsepower battery-powered pickup truck that can raise and lower its suspension six inches and even drive diagonally&lt;/a&gt;. The Hummer is a cornerstone of GM’s $27 billion push into EVs that will include the release of 30 new vehicles by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQgIkW"&gt;Both Hummers will be among the first vehicles built on GM’s new modular electric battery platform, Ultium, which the company says will deliver power ranging from 50 to 200 kWh, allowing for a driving range up to “400 miles or more.” For trucks, the Ultium platform will include 800-volt battery packs and 350 kW fast-charging capability, equivalent to a 100-mile charge in 10 minutes according to GM; for the SUV, fast charging is limited to 300 kW, and with 170 fewer horsepower at top spec, you’re also looking at 3.5 seconds to go from 0-60, rather than a flat 3.0 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkuBFk"&gt;The vehicles will also feature the second-generation version of GM’s advanced driver assist system, Super Cruise, that allows for “hands-free” highway driving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam survey suggests Nvidia’s RTX 3070 is actually trickling into the hands of gamers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FJD1pF"&gt;Now that the street price of an Nvidia RTX 3070 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;is over $1,200&lt;/a&gt;, it’s temping to think scalpers, bots and cryptocurrency miners got them all — but &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=pct"&gt;the latest Steam Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt; suggests at least some of them are making their way into gaming PCs, too. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89161-latest-steam-survey-rtx-3070-month-top-performer.html%5C"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechSpot&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU, and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDnoHZ5QcnHtNvbOjJKL3-m90MY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419138/top_20_gpus_steam_march_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top 20 GPUs on Steam, as of March 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CO7pls"&gt;The RTX 3080 also commands 0.87 percent, the RTX 3060 Ti has 0.39 percent, and the pricey RTX 3090 claims 0.34 percent of the market — for a total of 2.89 percent Ampere cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcj71q"&gt;That not bad, especially considering AMD’s rival RX 6000 series doesn’t have a single spot on the entire 95-GPU leaderboard. Apparently, more gamers are using the 2011 Nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti (0.16 percent) than any of AMD’s latest cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRspTo"&gt;More than a quarter of Steam PC gamers are now using AMD CPUs instead of Intel, though, so that’s probably some consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGQzUL"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;secondhand sales numbers&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, I would expect the newer RTX 3060 to contribute to Nvidia’s tally next month. &lt;/p&gt;
