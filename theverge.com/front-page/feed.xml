    <title>How to sign up for an invite for the Ring Always Home Cam, Amazon’s new security drone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mjTzvP3ZAIh1taI4g5GNi0pskgk=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921291/Ring_Always_Home_Cam_Lifestyle_Press_Image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Always Home Cam retails for $249.99 and is set to launch later this year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1VgilE"&gt;First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453709/ring-always-home-cam-indoor-drone-security-camera-price-specs-features-amazon"&gt;announced last year&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon will begin selling its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456089"&gt;Ring Always Home Cam&lt;/a&gt; starting today, September 28th, alongside the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456114"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Blink Video Doorbell, and several other products. There are just two caveats: access to the Ring Always Home Cam is invite-only at the moment, and it won’t ship until later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8kX0nO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Ring drone is just the latest Amazon privacy puzzle box","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21455197/amazon-ring-drone-home-security-surveillance-sidewalk-halo-privacy"},{"title":"We have a few questions about Amazon’s flying indoor security camera drone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/9/24/21454943/amazon-ring-always-home-cam-drone-security-biggest-questions"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MJzRtg"&gt;The new Ring Always Home Cam is an autonomous, indoor security camera that essentially amounts to a flying drone strapped with a Ring camera on the bottom. With it, you can keep an eye on what’s going inside of your home even while you’re away. That’s because the device streams 1080p video to your smartphone via the Ring app, allowing you to check for intruders or make sure you didn’t leave the stovetop on at a moment’s notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsl258"&gt;While owners can set up preselected paths for the drone to fly on, it’s also capable of automatically flying to other areas when it detects motion. What’s more, the drone additionally integrates with a Ring Alarm security system so that if your alarm goes off, the drone will fly a preset course to check out what’s going on. You also don’t need to worry about the drone running out of battery while you’re gone, either; once it’s finished flying around your home, the drone will automatically return to its dock to recharge like many of today’s modern robot vacuums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cTredJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10778479"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GIBhdN"&gt;The Ring Always Home Cam sells for $249.99, and if you’re located in the US, you can apply for an invite &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YH144XD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re on the fence, you can also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2jFN_QEcS4"&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt; to get a better idea of how the flying security camera works in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwhF5j"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blink’s first doorbell is finally released, four years later</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Blink Video Doorbell" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ll15s_6TSqHrpV5kqsWfRoobfxw=/0x0:647x431/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921232/amazon_blnk_doorbell.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blink Video Doorbell | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LMaeCx"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418648/amazon-blink-indoor-outdoor-home-cameras-announced-price"&gt;released a few new products from Blink &lt;/a&gt;since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/22/16810516/amazon-blink-acquisition-smart-camera-doorbell-company"&gt;acquiring the Kickstarter smart home security darling in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and today during its fall event it added three new items to the lineup that are made to mind your various entry points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hINIlS"&gt;Blink &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/12/19/16794764/blink-99-video-doorbell"&gt;announced a doorbell ahead of CES in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, but that one doesn’t appear to have hit the market, so this is the first-generation Blink Video Doorbell. It will be available for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Video-Doorbell/dp/B08SG2MS3V?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$49.99,&lt;/a&gt; and claims it’s ready for use in any home thanks to a design suited for wired or wire-free installation. 1080p HD video, night vision, motion detection, two-way audio feeds, and integration with Alexa are all a part of the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bRaa7"&gt;The doorbell runs on two AA lithium batteries, and Blink says that with a wired installation or paired with a Sync Module 2, the included set can last up to two years. Customers can save clips locally without a subscription if they add a sync module and USB flash drive, or opt for the Blink Subscription plan that adds the ability to record, save and share events. It works with Alexa, and can also send event notifications via the Blink app or to an existing in-home chime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Blink Floodlight Cam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4kqMV0_B4uDoeMtRZCF5S7ZkS-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884973/Blink_Flood_Light_Cam_1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Blink Floodlight Cam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Blink Solar Mount and Camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4aZ2eImULvfMuPSUrwyw1EeaMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884977/Blink_Solar_Mount_and_Camera_1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Blink Solar Mount and Camera&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cnUkFB"&gt;The Blink Floodlight Camera and Blink Solar Panel Mount + camera package a smart cam with accessories for even more capable awareness and security. The floodlight is battery-powered, capable of producing 700 lumens when it detects motion, and will be available with an outdoor camera for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Floodlight-battery-powered-floodlight/dp/B094YXRLCN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$139.98&lt;/a&gt; or as a mount for $39.99, while the solar-powered outdoor camera bundle will go on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blink-Outdoor-Solar-Panel-Charging/dp/B09GZPNV8P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129.98&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aw1Ro3"&gt;During the presentation, Amazon said it sold three times as many Blink items in 2021 as it did in 2019, which should bode well for the unit’s focus on “easy-to-use, affordable smart home security solutions.” The products ship starting November 4th, but preorders for all three items will start today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ISx0ts"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"On the Blink: Why does Amazon hate its most enthusiastic smart home fans?&amp;amp;nbsp;","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22381356/blink-homebridge-crackdown-amazon-subscriptions"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon announces new wearable and services to try to make you fitter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eJVYzLV7610wA0XmTNI7hE6mVtE=/389x0:2611x1481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921143/Halo_Accessories_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tgfhkm"&gt;Amazon has announced a new fitness band and a plethora of health services to go along with it. The new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NCGKHKF?ref_=ods_surl_be&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79.99 Halo View&lt;/a&gt; includes a color AMOLED display (similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22680300/fitbit-charge-5-review-fitness-tracker"&gt;Fitbit’s Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;) and a year of Amazon’s Halo membership, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GQAJNVT7S4XCHMT2"&gt;is required to access&lt;/a&gt; the tracker’s more advanced analytics. Amazon’s also launching a Halo Fitness service, which provides workout videos similar to Apple Fitness Plus, and Halo Nutrition, which helps you meal plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5aMOk"&gt;Amazon is pitching the Halo View as a follow-up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its previous Halo Band fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt;, which didn’t include a screen. While the Halo View can gather a ton of biometric data, including heart rate, blood oxygen level, and skin temperature, it won’t be gathering your voice data like the previous generation did — &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fitness/amazons-80-halo-view-fitness-tracker-drops-the-mic-adds-color-screen/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon has dropped the microphone that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;original Halo used to monitor and analyze your emotions&lt;/a&gt; (though that feature will still be available in the Halo app). The Halo View can also do sleep tracking and alert you to text messages with a haptic motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD5h7U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Halo View has a screen, but not the original Band’s microphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VdIRUU"&gt;The Halo View will come in three colors: black, green, and purple. You’ll also be able to buy additional bands (Amazon promises 15 colors of the sport bands), including ones made out of fabric, leather, and metal. Amazon says it has seven days of battery life and can be charged in 90 minutes, which is good, especially if you’ll be using it to track your sleep. Amazon says it’ll be shipping in time for the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kl4_ogkB5pNkCPaF84AGoCmL-YM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884912/HaloView_and_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Halo App provides access to your fitness data, workouts, recipes, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ILhQmY"&gt;The Halo Membership, which costs $3.99 a month after the first year that you get free with the View, will let you access advanced features like Amazon’s body composition scanning, activity points system, sleep analysis, Alexa integration (where Alexa devices can give you information that Halo collects), and more. It also gives you access to the new services Amazon announced today. Halo Fitness will include “hundreds” of cardio, strength, yoga, outdoor, and mobility classes, led by Halo coaches. Similar to Apple Fitness Plus, you’ll also be able to see metrics like heart rate from your Halo band overlaid on the video, though that functionality won’t be available when the service launches “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWZXMU"&gt;Amazon’s Halo Nutrition includes a collection of recipes from companies like Weight Watchers, Lifesum, and the Amazon-owned Whole Foods and includes Alexa integration — if you’re planning on making a recipe, you can add the ingredients to your Alexa shopping list. Amazon says Halo Nutrition will be available in January 2022. Both Nutrition and Fitness will be available to customers who have the original Halo Band as well, as they’ll live in the Halo App.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLxGzl"&gt;If you want to hear more about all the devices Amazon announced today, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22454350"&gt;read all our coverage of the event here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s the deluge of announcements from Amazon’s fall devices event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S0Yqg84JeMdVi8MbNsfk7PHS8is=/161x0:2000x1226/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921119/PHO_2021Q2_0025_CoRo_Valentine_Delivery_018_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image of Amazon’s Astro robot.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u7FCha"&gt;Amazon just wrapped its fall devices event, and it was chock-full of news, including new Echo devices, new Ring products and services, and even a home assistant robot named Astro. It was a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4GDJsz"&gt;We’ve recapped the biggest news of the show right here, including links to many of the &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; articles going into more detail about what Amazon announced. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwFIZVGehrzFZPaiLR_o10astWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882955/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Astro home robot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tc3kq7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22461285"&gt;Amazon’s Astro is the company’s new home robot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2n4tSO"&gt;Amazon revealed a home assistant robot, called Astro, which can help with home security monitoring, act as a mobile device, and more. It has a 10-inch touchscreen that can show a “face,” and it scoots around your house on wheels. You can request an invite to buy it as part of Amazon’s Day 1 Edition program, and it costs $999.99. The robot will begin shipping to selected customers later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aISUc25OpolIAZA6Inabp5hYspY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883823/echo_show_15_media_lifestyle_5.png"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="PWAiWG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22457544"&gt;The Echo Show 15 is a 15-inch smart display that can hang on your wall&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I6xgQr"&gt;Amazon announced its biggest smart display yet, the $249.99 Echo Show 15. It has a 15.6-inch, 1080p HD display that’s designed to be a shared hub for families, and it has a new AZ2 chip. It will be available later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="hsrdBd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22459748"&gt;The Echo Glow is a video chat gadget with built-in games for kids &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BFYhsq"&gt;Amazon’s new Echo Glow is a video conferencing device designed for kids. It has an eight-inch display to see friends or family members and a touch-sensitive tabletop projector gadget that can be used to play games, read books, and make art. It will have content from Disney, Nickelodeon, Mattel, and Sesame Workshop. If you want to try Glow, you can apply to the early access program, and if you’re selected, you can buy it for $249.99. When it is released to a wider audience, it will cost $299.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="2FPzKB"&gt;Amazon announced a new Fitbit-like fitness band with a color AMOLED display, called the Halo View. It costs $79.99 and comes with a full year of a Halo subscription membership. It will start shipping “in time for the holidays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0PUpm"&gt;Amazon also revealed new services for Halo members. One is an Apple Fitness Plus-like service called Halo Fitness, which will be available to Halo members later this year. The other is a MyFitnessPal-like nutrition-tracking service called Halo Nutrition, which will be rolling out in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cpIdWA"&gt;Amazon and Disney announced a new voice assistant called “Hey Disney,” which is built on Alexa. It offers a lot of Disney-themed Alexa experiences, and it will also be available in Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms for better hospitality. The “Hey Disney” assistant is “expected next year,” though it’s a paid skill unless you are staying at one of the resorts. There’s also a new Mickey Mouse-themed Echo Show 5 stand, which is available to preorder Tuesday for $24.99. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s race to create the disappearing computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Unveils New Alexa-Driven Devices" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BduiljwfA4IMOKeqkJeDx7bTxek=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921059/1171145260.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ambient computing is here; now what?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="n8cRtR"&gt;For his last column in 2017, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/25/15686870/walt-mossberg-final-column-the-disappearing-computer"&gt;Walt Mossberg predicted that technology would fade into the background, and so-called “ambient computing” would become ubiquitous&lt;/a&gt;. Four years later, we are well on our way — but what exactly that term means for how computers will work and how we’ll live is still very much up in the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZOywX"&gt;Many companies are working on some vision of ambient computing, but there’s nobody working harder to try to make the idea of ambient computing happen &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt; than Amazon’s head of hardware, Dave Limp. How he’s building that future today is a case study in how Big Tech confounds our preconceived notions of how progress works. We expected AI to look like HAL 9000. Instead, it looks a lot more like a Hammacher Schlemmer catalog. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tw2lWx"&gt;At Amazon’s yearly lollapalooza of gadget announcements, the company typically announces literally dozens of new Alexa-connected devices. Releasing so many different devices at such a heady clip makes a certain kind of sense: if computers are meant to be all around us, Amazon needs to produce as many different kinds of computers as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NFIA4y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Instead of HAL 9000, we’re getting Hammacher Schlemmer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JZ0KaE"&gt;This year, among the flood, Limp presented three devices that are paradigmatic of his vision for what he calls “ambient intelligence.” Subbing out the word “computer” for “intelligence” is a tell that he’s trying to change consumers’ thinking about how our digital lives will work in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC7fMF"&gt;Today, however, these three devices are limited to pushing the boundaries of — and our comfort levels with — what we expect out of smart homes. Critically, all three take part in a new kind of computing platform that is unlike what we’re used to seeing from Big Tech. It’s diffuse, dispersed, and sometimes difficult to comprehend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FDoF6U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Say hello to Astro, Alexa on wheels","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"},{"title":"Amazon Glow is a video chat gadget with built-in games to keep kids engaged","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22695707/amazon-glow-video-chat-kids-games-price-features-release-date"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 15 is meant to hang on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JFgpFV"&gt;The big one is Astro, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697244/amazon-astro-home-robot-hands-on-features-price"&gt;two-wheeled robot with a screen for a face&lt;/a&gt; that can trundle around your home and serve as a watchdog, assisted living companion, and (of course) beer delivery vehicle. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22695707/amazon-glow-video-chat-kids-games-price-features-release-date"&gt;Amazon Glow&lt;/a&gt;, a new kind of videoconferencing gadget that projects a play surface on a table, so your grandkids are less likely to wander off during a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f39Eyc7YQEmhyxI1MEMkrdLYyhk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882962/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro home robot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FoSR9W"&gt;Finally, though it isn’t as weird, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"&gt;Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt; has the chance to make the idea of a true smart home family hub a reality by turning the Echo into a big digital picture frame that you can hang on your wall. That familiarity means it’s the one that’s likely to sell the most and therefore make the biggest impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKYxLX"&gt;Normally when we talk about gadgets, we talk about the operating systems on which they run. iPhones have iOS, Samsung phones have Android, Windows computers have, well, Windows. But the operating system on Amazon’s gadgets is almost beside the point — because the point is that the thing that &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; matters is the Alexa ecosystem to which they’re connected. “I don’t really think about it as an operating system in the traditional sense,” Limp says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXJw1V"&gt;“We think about that as a framework that we internally call ambient intelligence,” Limp says. “It’s not one individual system. It is a lot of systems running in the cloud” and on the so-called “edge,” aka the gadgets you actually have in your house. To say that there’s such a thing as a single Alexa platform isn’t really accurate, Limp argues. It’s an old way of thinking. “Behind the scenes, we have this whole layer of software, literally, hundreds of different services, some on the edge, some in the cloud,” he argues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1vpekR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I don’t really think about it as an operating system in the traditional sense.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uObeKZ"&gt;More than any other tech journalist, I’ve cracked jokes about Apple’s “What’s a computer?” ad — the one that asks us to recontextualize how a new generation thinks about the iPad. But with Amazon’s ambient intelligence platform, it’s no longer a joke. The computer is both in the cloud and on the device, and the actual computing happens here, there, and everywhere — and as a consumer, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to locate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c50r5U"&gt;Some of it is and will continue to happen on “the edge.” Amazon promises to soon enable completely local processing of your voice on newer devices. Ring Alarm systems can be end-to-end encrypted, and the new one can be used without even sending the encrypted video to Amazon’s cloud. The Astro robot needs to do all of its navigation and recognition right on the device both for privacy and practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1McfT"&gt;But after that, it’s a messy melange of inputs, outputs, machine learning, and hunches (literally, Amazon calls its technology for predicting your commands “&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G7F5F7K93GKSLC4F"&gt;hunches&lt;/a&gt;”). Limp says that as many as one out of four actions taken by Alexa devices today are proactive — they’re done by Alexa based on what it has learned about your desires instead of in response to a specific command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MFH4VNb7G5Uj2A5Ybb8E_u7yiMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883502/Amazon_Glow_Projected_Home_Display.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Echo Glow projector&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WijIjU"&gt;In Alexa and its associated gadgets, Amazon has created a computing paradigm that is just as important as Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android. But because it’s dispersed among smart home gadgets and smart speakers instead of in monolithic screens that we engage with directly, it’s harder to pin down or describe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGUvCi"&gt;“We’re trying to bring this ambient intelligence and AI to places that the industry seems to have abandoned,” Limp says. Rather than try to take on the rest of Big Tech directly, Amazon has always (Fire phone aside) tried to go to places where there’s less competition. In doing so, it has carved out a lead in the smart home and voice assistant space with the Alexa platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0cJjn"&gt;Also, in doing so, Amazon has courted controversy. The very nature of smart home gadgets means they’re going to have cameras, microphones, and other sensors. Every time Amazon announces a new kind of gadget, there’s an inevitable and often justified backlash of concern that it’s further eroding our privacy. Although the company has done lots of work to secure its devices and provide clear and strong protections, the backlash is unavoidable given the nature of the products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3jIP3"&gt;Limp’s take is that a future where computers and sensors are everywhere is inevitable, so he’s trying to build them with safeguards in place. “I don’t imagine a world 10 years in our future where every house doesn’t have at least one robot,” he says. “I don’t anticipate a future where every house doesn’t have some sort of ambient intelligence in it. And so then the question is, what can you do to make sure that you get to that future, but you don’t end up with the Orwellian, dystopian version of that? For us, that means we have to kind of invent our way there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yVfR71"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why wouldn’t you want a customer to try a robot, if you can build it?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="16903b"&gt;There is a kind of brazenness to some of Amazon’s gadgets. Last year, it announced (though it has yet to ship) a video drone that flies around inside your house. This year’s Astro robot is almost guaranteed to elicit a resounding “nope” from privacy advocates despite the company’s promises to safely handle sensitive data locally on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeE22H"&gt;“Talking about the industry as a whole, I think it’s not taking enough risk. Why wouldn’t you want a customer to try a robot if you can build it?” Limp asks. “Why wouldn’t you want to see a customer try a Glow and see if they do resonate with grandparents or a parent that’s on deployment or wherever they might be. I think our job is to invent like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4qIq0"&gt;Here’s the bind Amazon has made for itself: it’s building an ambient computing platform that is diffuse and difficult to pin down, but the things we justifiably demand from our computing platforms — things like privacy, security, and accountability — require answers that are specific and clear. Although, on paper, Amazon almost always has answers to the biggest privacy questions, it’s the questions that we don’t know to ask that are often the most troubling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI-caANyFkhRlftUAa-YVj8Ap1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22883512/echo_show_15_media_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Show 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5sIPdq"&gt;Platforms are also about helping other people build upon them. A platform should create an economy of success around it, where other companies are able to build businesses. Given the proliferation of smart home gadgets, Amazon has certainly done that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QMDNdR"&gt;But most platforms also help us &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; things. I take videos with my phone, make music on my tablet, write blogs on my laptop, and build out spreadsheets on my desktop. Amazon’s platform is, at its core, about convenience and consumption. Alexa sets timers and answers questions, but it also plays music. There’s home security, sure, but there are also Kindle books, Prime TV, Amazon Music, and Kids Plus content. There’s a difference between entertainment and creation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1i4Tdv"&gt;Underlying all of this is the fact that Amazon is making this platform happen via the most Amazonian of mediums: retail. It’s building our ambient computing future with smart cameras, speakers, robots, picture frames, lightbulbs, and other gadgets. We have just started to figure out how to think about the societal implications of smartphones; now, we’ve got robots and teleconference board game systems for children. It’s all happening very fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="D2k2H1"&gt;Amazon’s ambient intelligence platform is succeeding because it is less constrained by the computing paradigms of the past. It has, without a doubt, made our homes smarter and our lives more convenient. The disappearing computer can do a lot for us; now, the next question is what &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; are going to be able to do with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70ClVk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDNVUu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s AZ2 CPU knows your face</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSgB7IxpljEToPdcRVqyKz9QrL4=/99x0:1551x968/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69921054/chrome_6FpHFOD0Qj.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The AZ2 brings facial recognition to the new Echo Show&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZrFZrf"&gt;The announcement of Amazon’s new wall-mounted Echo Show 15 also revealed its new CPU that comes with some interesting (or potentially scary) applications. The AZ2 chip builds on the machine learning interface that premiered with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453205/amazon-az1-neural-edge-processor-echo-show-10-alexa-voice-on-device"&gt;AZ1&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed Amazon devices to better recognize your voice, but has extended this capability to facial recognition as well. This comes with Amazon’s new focus on what it calls “Ambient Intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6nVwV"&gt;Let's explain what the AZ2 does on paper before we dive into the implications of this hardware. The AZ2 is capable of 22 times the amount of operations per second compared to the AZ1, which means it can simultaneously process speech and facial recognition locally. The information the AZ2 learns about your face will be part of what Amazon is calling “Visual ID” and requires users to specifically enroll in this feature. This enables the Echo Show 15 to recognize you and display custom content based on your Alexa profile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoMwQO"&gt;Much like its predecessor, the AZ2 is a neural edge processor, which means that it utilizes machine learning to cut down on the amount of data it needs to send or receive from the cloud. This has the benefit of not only reducing latency but also cutting back on the amount of data that gets stored on the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQem4k"&gt;While Amazon has made it remarkably easy to control, view, and edit the information it can access, there is something eerily dystopian about a machine that can automatically recognize you when you walk into a room. If you’re someone that gets annoyed whenever your Alexa accidentally recognizes your voice, you may want to skip enrolling in Visual ID.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWZITJ"&gt;Currently, the Echo Show 15 is the only piece of Amazon hardware that we know will include the AZ2. But just like the AZ1, you can expect it to become a keystone piece of technology in Amazon devices going forward.      &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMWUT4"&gt;For full details on some of the other devices that Amazon announced at its fall hardware event today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22690309/amazon-fall-hardware-event-rumors-news-announcements"&gt;check out our coverage of the event here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Astro home robot&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s long-awaited home robot is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uWyMCR"&gt;In the fall of 1962, TV-watching audiences were invited to meet the Jetsons, a space-dwelling, flying-car-driving family from the future and their dog, Astro. Today, Amazon wants you to meet a different Astro, one that’s not quite as fantastical or futuristic as the Jetsons, but actually available in our present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kguNTY"&gt;Amazon’s Astro is not a dog; instead, it’s the company’s long-rumored home assistant robot. Though Amazon denies taking inspiration for the name from &lt;em&gt;The Jetsons&lt;/em&gt;, it was hard to ignore the resemblance to a faithful pet when I got to see the Astro in action last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PkMmz"&gt;The Astro, which will initially cost $999.99 and available as a Day 1 Edition product that you can request an invite for the privilege of buying, is Amazon’s most ambitious in-home product yet. Amazon sees it as bringing together many different parts of the company — robotics, AI, home monitoring, cloud services — all into one device. Best described as the love child between a Roomba and an Echo Show smart display, the Astro is meant to be the next step in what Amazons believes to be the seemingly inevitable home robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H4TG3L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro is an attempt to combine a number of Amazon’s strengths&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duHyjP"&gt;Amazon claims the Astro can do a wide variety of things you might want from a home robot. It can map out your floor plan and obey commands to go to a specific room. It can recognize faces and deliver items to a specific person. It can play music and show you the weather and answer questions like any Echo smart display. It can be used for video calls, always keeping you in frame by literally following your movements. It can roam around your house when you aren’t home, making sure everything is okay. It can raise its periscope camera to show you whether you’ve turned the stove off. It can use third-party accessories to record data like blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCZCzw"&gt;But as ambitious as the Astro is, it still is very much a first cut at what a home assistant robot could be. It doesn’t have any arms or appendages; it can’t clean your floors; it can’t climb stairs; it can’t go outside of your home; and it probably can’t do a zillion other things I’m not thinking of at the moment. That’s part of the reason why Amazon is limiting its availability at launch — even after years of development, it still has a lot to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwFIZVGehrzFZPaiLR_o10astWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882955/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has a 10-inch touchscreen for a “face” and a wide array of sensors for eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nu5NSx"&gt;The Astro stands roughly two feet high and weighs about 20 pounds. Its main drive wheels are about 12 inches in diameter, large enough to clear door thresholds and move through carpet, while a single caster in the back helps it keep balanced. The Astro can zip along at a top speed of one meter per second and it has the ability to move in 360 degrees, forward, back, or any direction it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5QMQk"&gt;Inside the plastic-clad shell are five different motors: one for each drive wheel, one to raise and lower its periscope camera, and two to twist and tilt its “face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpzbH5"&gt;That face is effectively the screen lifted off an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got an array of sensors in its bezel, plus a standard 5-megapixel video calling camera. Most of the time, the screen displays two circles that behave as “eyes,” allowing you to understand what the Astro is doing or where it’s planning to go. It can also show some limited personality through these circles, contorting them into different shapes and angles, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/4/18250104/jibo-social-robot-server-shutdown-offline-dead"&gt;ill-fated Jibo’s expressions&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18523124/anki-drive-robot-toy-company-out-of-business-shutting-down"&gt;also-ill-fated Cozmo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0V5uSs"&gt;But those circles aren’t what the Astro uses to see you or its environment. It’s actual “eyes” are the variety of sensors and cameras packed into the base of the unit, things like ultrasonic sensors, time-of-flight cameras, and other imaging tools that let the robot know what’s around it and where it’s going. The Astro’s navigational tools are all inside of itself — there’s no need for special boundary markers or other external guidelines like some robot vacuums rely on — and it can tell when it’s about to head down a set of stairs or hit an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wuELuL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s race to create the disappearing computer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 15 is meant to hang on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Amazon marries Ring and Eero in a neat, white package","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vVEEzJ"&gt;In another similarity to a robot vacuum, the Astro will use these sensors to map out your home. You can label each room and adjust the boundaries in the Astro smartphone app. You can also set up specific “viewpoints” in your home that the robot will remember. From there, you can tell the Astro to go to a specific location either with a voice command or remotely through the app. Since the Astro can’t go up or down stairs, Amazon expects most people to place it on the main floor of their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icgHLn"&gt;Amazon says all of the processing and storage for these maps happens locally on the device and nothing is stored in the cloud. The Astro can only be paired to a single phone at a time — a security measure to help prevent unauthorized access or use. Similarly, its facial recognition data is also stored locally on the Astro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3NRb7I"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Astro demo clip|104104" data-volume-uuid="f75493661" data-volume-id="104104" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-34" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Inside the Astro are five different motors that allow it to move freely. | &lt;/em&gt;Animation: Amazon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UhwiLi"&gt;Between the sensors on the front of the robot are a couple of two-inch speakers. There’s also a passive resonator on the bottom to improve bass output. These can get quite loud when playing music, and since the Astro can literally follow you around and always move itself to the optimal position, you’re almost always going to be able to hear it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbqL3W"&gt;To make up for its diminutive size, the Astro has a 12-megapixel periscope camera that can raise up to 42 inches high, enough to see over a typical counter or table. This camera can be used for video calls or viewed through the accompanying phone app to see what’s happening inside your home when you’re not there. Surrounding the telescoping pole are the far-field mics that are used to pick up voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdq4gU"&gt;Around back is a small payload area, capable of carrying 4.4lbs (2kg) of cargo. By default, this area has an insert with two cupholders, but that can easily be swapped for a basic bin. Amazon envisions this area to be something third parties will take advantage of and for which they’ll design accessories. There’s a 15-watt USB-C port in the payload area that you can use to charge your phone, but the real utility of that is for accessories to plug into. Amazon’s executives spoke of a blood pressure cuff that will utilize it, though I wasn’t able to see that in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Znw2OvCFTyJD9q8kPp8RLHcLEEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882953/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 42-inch tall periscope camera allows the Astro to see over counters or other tall obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QclzNK"&gt;Like a robot vacuum (again), the Astro has a charging dock to which it can automatically attach itself. Charging the battery from zero to 100 takes about 45 minutes and it can go for about two hours of motion between charges. The Astro is designed to manage its battery life on its own — if it needs to recharge, it will just go to its dock by itself — but you can also tell it to do so by voice commands, through the touchscreen or in the app. The internal battery is located under the payload area and can be replaced when it no longer holds a charge, but it’s not designed to be changed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwZ4mV"&gt;The brains of the Astro are Qualcomm chips, not the Amazon-designed AZ2 processor that’s in the new Echo Show 15. The company says it used Qualcomm silicon here because of the Astro’s long development time. Like its maps, all of the Astro’s processing and movements happen locally — for privacy reasons but also for practicality. A cloud-based system wouldn’t be able to respond as quickly when the Astro needs to navigate around an unfamiliar obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g87IU5"&gt;For those interested, the Astro’s functionality is built on top of Fire OS and Linux. Amazon isn’t announcing an official Astro SDK today, but it says, “it’s easy to imagine a world where customers and developers can build unique capabilities that allow Astro to keep getting better over time, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVtSkP"&gt;The Astro’s design isn’t particularly beautiful or elegant — its utilitarian looks seem to be driven more by functionality than emotion. Amazon executives told me many different form factors and designs were tested and this shape is what they’ve landed on for now. But the design is not offensive or intimidating either, something that is important to get right if people are going to accept a largely autonomous robot in their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hmlMkk8vl0V-2p_lK38S4L8Ikc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882947/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s large wheels allow it to roll over most obstacles it might encounter in a home, like thresholds or power cables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W8c2b3"&gt;Trying to wrap your head around how all of those features and capabilities together might be useful in your home can be a challenge. Amazon envisions a handful of use cases — home security monitoring, remote elder care, and convenience — but it also readily admits that there could be more that just haven’t been found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttfkh9"&gt;That first use case is perhaps the most obvious one. The Astro can integrate with Ring’s security alarm system and function much like a Ring camera. It can capture video clips of events and send them to Ring’s cloud, and it can also automatically go to the site of a disturbance, if say a Ring motion or door sensor goes off when you’re not home. You can also program it to make autonomous patrols on a schedule, or direct it manually to go check something out through the Astro app. It’s not unlike the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456089"&gt;Ring Always Home Cam drone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBCMoH"&gt;Remote monitoring of your home is perhaps where the Astro’s periscope camera is most useful. You can tell it to raise the camera to see over a counter or obstacle and switch between the periscope camera and the camera mounted above the screen easily. Amazon’s execs were eager to tell me how useful it is to check if the oven was left on when you aren’t home. The Astro also has Alexa Guard integration, allowing it to alert you to sounds of a broken window or smoke alarm, just like an Echo speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FifZt_-Js2CtWZdeIan-SQmSyVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882946/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has sensors and cameras all around it help it navigate your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVq3eu6oBujSB0PNQRVuMC2ORPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882948/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s rear payload area is customizable — Amazon anticipates third-party companies will make accessories for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCB9zC"&gt;Amazon also envisions the Astro as being useful for remote monitoring of elderly relatives. Thanks to its ability to recognize faces, it can look for an elderly person and provide status notifications to their caregivers. Routines can be programmed where it will remind the person to take medication or check their blood pressure when they need to; the Astro’s ability to find them means that it can deliver this reminder even if they aren’t in the same room as it. The Astro will also be integrated into the new Alexa Together service, which provides access to an emergency helpline and support for fall detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoF34h"&gt;Lastly, Amazon sees the Astro as the next level of how Alexa can integrate into your home. Though the Astro’s wake word for voice commands is “Astro” (by default, it can be changed to Alexa, Echo, or Computer, but sadly not Artoo), the intelligence underpinning it all is Alexa. The Astro is effectively an Echo Show on wheels — you can ask it to follow you around as you do things; have it play music or podcasts while you’re doing chores; ask it to set reminders, timers, or take a photo; use it for video calling through Alexa’s calling service; and do all the other things an Echo Show can do. The software on the screen itself is effectively lifted right off the Echo Show, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6OPw"&gt;The Astro’s ability to recognize faces means it knows who it’s looking at and can play a greeting or turn on your favorite music when it sees you. It’s designed to learn your habits, so if you end up using it most of the time in the kitchen, it will park itself there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Xxgf"&gt;Amazon has also built more personality into the Astro than we’re used to from Alexa. It will move its body, change the shape of its eyes, and adjust its screen to express attention or emotions. You can ask it to do silly things like dance, and it moves around in a way that’s meant to make it easy to tell where it’s going, when it’s going to turn, and so on. Amazon says that beta testers claimed the Astro’s personality made it feel more like a part of their home than a smart speaker or other gadget; it will surely draw comparisons to the Jibo robot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;engendered similar attachments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbYJoDPvp1xr3btFgORYCKOfEoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882961/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro will turn its “head” to look at you or indicate where it’s going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NArSd4"&gt;For all of the things that the Astro can do, however, there’s a laundry list of things it can’t. In a demo of the device ahead of its official announcement, I was able to see Astro perform a variety of tasks, such as go to a specific room, find a particular person, take a photo, and so on. I was able to ask it to follow me around as I walked from one room to another; it had no trouble navigating around random obstacles that ended up in its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZpU1u"&gt;But as mentioned, it can’t go outside; it can’t go up or down stairs; it has no arms or appendages to open doors or cabinets; and it can’t help you move or get up if you’ve fallen down. Sure, it can deliver an ice cold beer to a specific person, but someone still has to get the beer out of the fridge and put it in the back of the Astro before telling it where to go. It can show you that the oven was left on, but it has no ability to press the buttons itself to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9eGTFh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro’s competition will be software assistants as much as other robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RYUTG"&gt;It also doesn’t do a lot of assistant-type things that software is already starting to handle. There’s no ability for it to answer your phone and deal with telemarketers (something Google Pixel phones are already doing) or have it work with your doctor’s office to schedule your next appointment. The Astro can tell you when someone’s rung the doorbell, but it can’t go ahead and sign for that package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoOzQ"&gt;Amazon, for its part, is clear-eyed about the Astro’s limitations. That’s part of the reason why it’s releasing it with a limited, invite-only system before launching it to the public. The company told me that things like robot arms and other appendages could certainly unlock many more capabilities, but right now the cost is too great to make them practical or accessible. There’s also the problem of what people will be comfortable with in their home at this stage — the Astro’s current design isn’t a huge leap from a robot vacuum, but add a bunch of R2-D2-like grabber arms and the ability to open doors and people might start getting uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2_KpgEqiXwOQtAqeWeOykAbjUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882959/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro uses the circles on its screen to express different emotions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OsQNTN"&gt;That’s why, as it functions right now, the Astro feels more like an artificial pet than a true robotic assistant. It can do some tricks, provide some entertainment, and help out a little bit here and there, but it’s far from the kind of robots that science fiction has conditioned us to expect. Even the Astro’s insistence on putting itself in the best position for you to see and hear it (a couple feet in front of you, screen tilted up toward you) is undeniably similar to a dog begging for some scratches behind the ears or a piece of jerky. It’s hard not to find the thing just a little bit endearing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKp1pR"&gt;Amazon is convinced that everyone will have a robot of some sort in their home in the next five to ten years. The Astro is the company’s attempt to get out ahead of the field, before it’s too crowded with competitors. (It used this exact same approach to great success with the Echo.) It’s also only the first of its attempts at putting a robot in your home, and given the company’s nearly endless resources, it doesn’t need the Astro to be a huge sales success to keep developing on this idea. The introductory price of $999.99 includes a six-month trial of Ring Protect Pro, though Amazon says its price will go up to $1449.99 once it reaches broader release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wMcoFF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many questions about the Astro remain unanswered for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdQ09j"&gt;The question for all of us then, is how much do we want to be testing Amazon’s ideas and experiments in our most intimate of spaces? The company has done a lot to mitigate privacy concerns with the Astro’s local processing, but it can’t possibly know every way someone will feel their personal space violated by a robot in their home until it’s already there. That’s why it needs to do larger-scale testing than it’s able to do in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F70vj"&gt;I’m also curious to see how it reacts and behaves in a real-world environment, outside of Amazon’s beta testers. How’s it going to function when a toddler decides it’d be fun to sit on the back and ride it? How will a real-life dog deal with this robotic interloper in its domain? Can it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;avoid dog poop&lt;/a&gt;? How useful will it actually be when it’s limited to just one floor of a multistory home? How much convenience can it really add beyond the smart speakers that are already in my home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XYo9jo"&gt;Those answers will have to wait until we’re able to spend more time with the Astro and push its capabilities first hand. Until then, we’ll have to be content with dreams of robotic dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Alexa Together wants to help you care for family remotely</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtRQQc"&gt;Amazon is announcing a new subscription service called Alexa Together today during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684357/amazon-fall-event-devices-services-features-september-28th-echo-alexa"&gt;invite-only fall hardware event&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s new $19.99 per month service offers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21560891/amazon-alexa-care-hub-how-to-use-setup"&gt;the same features as the free Alexa Care Hub&lt;/a&gt; and will eventually replace it as Amazon’s tool for caring for family members remotely in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbkMma"&gt;Like Care Hub, Alexa Together can notify you when a family member uses their Alexa device, offer a feed of interactions they had with the assistant throughout the day, and function as a quick way to get a hold of each other in the case of an emergency. Alexa Together adds new emergency features like hands-free access to an “urgent response emergency helpline” and compatibility with fall detection devices from ATS and Vayyar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xaQVwL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s elder care features are no longer free&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7mt334"&gt;Caregivers with access to Alexa Together will have the optional ability to set reminders, manage shopping lists, and set up music services without having to access an Alexa device in person. Amazon also says it’ll expand the number of accounts that can manage Alexa Together next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z8ZJzU"&gt;These features are a solid expansion of what Care Hub was already capable of, making the service more than just a tool for elderly family members, but anyone who could benefit from extra caregiving help. Alexa Together costs $19.99 per month, and Amazon says new customers will get a six-month free trial to Alexa Together. Former Care Hub users will get a whole year for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="If5KhX"&gt;Alongside today’s announcement, Amazon also introduced new updates to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456114"&gt;its line of Ring alarms and doorbells&lt;/a&gt; and an even larger wall-mounted version of its Alexa with a screen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22457544"&gt;the Echo Show 15&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOIh5s"&gt;Alexa Together will be available later this year for $19.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s mobile gaming platform spreads to Spain, Italy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r7lrirv1yrViJ1Jua4QUVZ6GSi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920882/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWFDh5"&gt;It has only been a few months since Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;confirmed plans to include games as part of its subscription&lt;/a&gt;, and after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642946/netflix-mobile-games-in-app-android-users-poland-stranger-things-1984-3"&gt;an initial test in Poland&lt;/a&gt;, the streamer is opening its selection of Android titles to customers in Spain and Italy. While Netflix has had some promotional titles before, with tie-ins recently revealed for everything from Oculus VR to PC gamers on Steam, this experience is built directly into its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xD1bzl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The rollout continues! Today members in Spain and Italy will see Netflix Games available on their Android phones. We’re still in the early stages of our gaming experience, however here’s a snapshot of what’s new… &lt;a href="https://t.co/LHaQJmCBvn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LHaQJmCBvn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rjsHzj"&gt;The Netflix games test is only available on Android at the moment, while tweets from its localized accounts for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixES/status/1442856482127634435"&gt;Spain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixIT/status/1442866775851372545"&gt;Italy&lt;/a&gt; show it still works by pushing customers to the Google Play Store. There, they can install the titles that are playable as part of their normal subscription. After they’re installed, players can launch them from the main Netflix app, but it’s not like watching a movie since players are shifted over to the game’s own app. There are five games to choose from: &lt;em&gt;Shooting Hoops, Card Blast, Teeter Up, Stranger Things: 1984&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaOO5h"&gt;One important change is visible already in the screenshots, as the gaming section has received its own section in the bottom navigation bar, which should make it more visible to people simply browsing the app. When they announced the effort in July, Netflix execs said, “Games will be included in members’ Netflix subscription at no additional cost, similar to films and series. Initially, we’ll be primarily focused on games for mobile devices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRrCNd"&gt;Today’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1442865946931040256"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; indicates the company is “still in the early stages of our gaming experience,” without revealing anything about when it might be available in the US. If you’re desperate for hints, the most telling factor is probably that it’s in English.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Package alerts come to Ring’s wired doorbells</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5va60agsnJ_vGfFz97cVGR84Co0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920872/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Ring Pro 2 video doorbell (pictured) and the Ring Video Doorbell (2020) will now be able to tell you when a package is on your doorstep.  | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K03c9F"&gt;Ring is bringing package alerts to its Ring video doorbells, and it’s about time, too. This is a much-requested feature that’s already found on most of its competitors’ camera doorbell offerings. When the main selling point for a product is that it will deter porch pirates, it’s kind of important to be able to keep a virtual eye on those packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjgaN"&gt;The pings that will tell you when a package is on your porch will start rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;Ring Pro 2&lt;/a&gt; and Ring Video Doorbell (2020) in the US and internationally today and should arrive on other buzzers next year. But this still doesn’t address a big issue with most of Ring’s doorbells; the cameras’ wide viewing angles often don’t pick up the spot where the package is left. Only the Pro 2 has a head-to-toe view for seeing the whole porch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_knnMUMfe3Pm_OPE5jz4MY5cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884281/Package_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Pro 2 is the only Ring doorbell that can show you a head-to-toe view, which is useful for seeing packages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trcpZF"&gt;Along with playing catch-up in the industry it invented, Ring has a new trick up its sleeve: Custom Event Alerts. This feature lets you create your own alert based on the information you want to know. For example, is the garage door open? Is the car in the driveway? Is the front door shut? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59NRh"&gt;Custom Event Alerts will only be available on the Spotlight Cam Battery and are scheduled to arrive later this year. Both Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts require a subscription to a Ring Protect plan (starting at $3 a month or $30 a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6jvQh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring custom alerts demo video|104114" data-volume-uuid="48c385801" data-volume-id="104114" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-242" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BapcvU"&gt;Ring says the custom alerts work by having you train your camera on the two states you want it to recognize, such as when a garage door is left open or closed or when a car is in the driveway or not. The computer vision algorithm processes images of the scene in the cloud and sends an alert when it sees a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcIUPc"&gt;“You can literally build your own detector — there’s so many neat things to do with it,” said Ring founder Jamie Siminoff in an interview. He taught a camera to tell him when his HVAC compressor was on or off. “I was having problems with the outdoor compressor and was able to train it to tell me if the fan was spinning or if it wasn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXn7G4dSx_TbWjhPm6cLT7e3fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884280/Custom_Event_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature on the Ring Spotlight Cam lets you create custom event alerts to tell you when the state of something changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRKzK"&gt;The camera uses computer vision and machine learning to figure out the difference between the two states and should then recognize when that state changes and alert you to it. This type of AI-powered motion detection is the next arms race in the smart home. Companies are competing to find the best way to send their users fewer annoying alerts in favor of more relevant, useful ones from their smart home cameras. And what’s more relevant than an alert you create yourself and custom design for your home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv2cGw"&gt;To date, Ring has been behind here, partly hampered by a reliance on battery-powered tech, which energy-intensive smart alerts can swamp. Category leaders such as Arlo and Google Nest already offer package, people, animal, and vehicle alerts, but Ring could well be the first to let you create your own. This is a bold claim, however, and we won’t know if it holds up until we’ve been able to test it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
