    <title>Earth just had the hottest month since humans have kept track </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-TURKEY-FIRE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ydf_v7ScOqj2IhziQY80nPGRoo=/6x0:6042x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723413/1234435483.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Locals use water hoses to extinguish a burning trees in Koycegiz district of Mugla on August 3, 2021. - Turkey’s struggles against its deadliest wildfires in decades come as a blistering heatwave grips southeastern Europe creating tinderbox conditions that Greek officials blame squarely on climate change. The fires tearing through Turkey since July 28 have destroyed huge swathes of pristine forest and forced the evacuation of panicked tourists from seaside hotels.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by YASIN AKGUL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3T8Bp"&gt;July 2021 was officially the hottest month humans have ever recorded. This July narrowly beat out three previous months in 2016, 2019, and 2020 that had tied for the previous title. The fact that all of this has happened so recently just screams climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qEDVM2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fact that all of this has happened so recently just screams climate change.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2yreB2"&gt;“In this case, first place is the worst place to be,” Rick Spinrad, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), said in a &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/its-official-july-2021-was-earths-hottest-month-on-record"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. NOAA confirmed the new temperature record today, which Spinrad said, “adds to the disturbing and disruptive path that climate change has set for the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2DVxGS"&gt;Scientists have more evidence than ever that links climate change to more extreme weather, especially when it comes to heat. By burning fossil fuels, humans have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;influenced the weather around the world&lt;/a&gt;, a major new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;United Nations climate report&lt;/a&gt; said definitively when it was published earlier this week. Almost every region of the world, apart from the polar regions, has seen a rise in extreme heat events since the 1950s, according to the new report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owJeEv"&gt;“Climate change is a problem that is here now. Nobody’s safe, and it’s getting worse faster,” Inger Andersen, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme, said in an August 9 press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vzbY5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt; ‘&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/" target="_blank"&gt;virtually impossible’&lt;/a&gt; without climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bNSDVH"&gt;While last month was the hottest month in the books &lt;em&gt;globally&lt;/em&gt; since records started 142 years ago, the heat was particularly bad in some regions. July absolutely smashed the land-surface temperature record for the entire Northern Hemisphere, according to NOAA. Asia also had its hottest July on record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxHLnO"&gt;Such unprecedented heat can take a heavy toll even in typically cooler regions, especially since people and infrastructure there haven’t had to adapt to such hot summers — until now. Southwest Canada and the Pacific Northwest, for example, have suddenly suffered repeated heatwaves this summer that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;mangled roads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;killed hundreds of people, sent thousands more to emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;, and fueled massive wildfires. The most severe heatwave to hit, which took place in late June, would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change, an international team of researchers determined. It was also declared the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;“most extreme” summer heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in North America since records began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzfikT"&gt;August has been scorching, too. &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-forecasts/dangerous-heat-wave-to-bake-northwest-set-record-highs-in-seattle-portland/996889"&gt;Another heatwave&lt;/a&gt; is bearing down on the Pacific Northwest. Europe might have seen its &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;hottest day on record on August 11&lt;/a&gt;, when the mercury rose to 48.8 degrees Celsius (119.8 degrees Fahrenheit) in Sicily, Italy. The World Meteorological Organization is still working to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;verify that record.&lt;/a&gt; But if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow, the world is likely to see more and more temperature records fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit launches a TikTok-like video feed on iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hdhcRJ5b6ulX4oI91R2QqFxuOl8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723291/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YroA8w"&gt;If you opened your Reddit app today and noticed a new video button next to the search bar, you could be a tap away from experiencing the forum platform’s take on TikTok. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/reddit-is-quietly-rolling-out-a-tiktok-like-video-feed-button-on-ios/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; writes that the video feed, which pulls content from subreddits you follow along with some you don’t, started rolling out to iOS users on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RGvuIr"&gt;Loading up the feed on my own Reddit iOS app, the experience is unavoidably TikTok-like. You can scroll through a vertical, perpetual list of videos featuring content from the wide world of Reddit. Interaction options include upvoting and downvoting, along with commenting, “awarding” (using Reddit’s in-app currency to purchase medals and reactions), and sharing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3Dunqfr9nYAM5odNvpYcbV30AQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781201/66077368_EA5F_4728_9D41_DF790EBC4C7E.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video feed in the Reddit iOS app looks a lot like TikTok.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgKr-2-f-0y_6QFwWcdidET_zKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781200/3D11EAB5_4D9C_4A7E_ACA0_9BD59A0C5C5B.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Reddit video feed allows you to upvote, downvote, and comment on videos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IfFe6T"&gt;What’s not clear is how Reddit pulls video content from subreddits you don’t follow. TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfczi2cI6Cs"&gt;is famous for its algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, but when &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; asked if Reddit deployed something similar, the company declined to comment. When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;how it recommends content, and if the video feature had an official title, Reddit also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SvEaU"&gt;It shouldn’t be too surprising that Reddit is pushing further into video. Not necessarily because other platforms and social networks like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/a&gt; have their own TikTok competitors, but because Reddit implied as much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173774/reddit-acquires-dubsmash-tiktok-rival-short-form-video-tools"&gt;when it acquired Dubsmash&lt;/a&gt;. The creative video app isn’t involved in this specific feature, but Reddit still intends to incorporate its video tools — and entirely new ones — into its platform going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pf5e2y"&gt;Reddit hasn’t shared specific details on when you can expect the feature to hit your device, or if it’ll come to Android, but it is rolling out now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is changing the contrast of buttons again after complaints of eye strain</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qSZJQi4J1xPhMf1Uc59YFylz1ro=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723254/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yjh9X1"&gt;Twitter is readjusting the contrast on its buttons following feedback about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620438/twitter-changes-font-chirp-design-icon"&gt;design updates&lt;/a&gt; from earlier this week. Some people &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitters-new-font-chirp-is-apparently-giving-some-users-headaches/"&gt;have reported&lt;/a&gt; eye strain, headaches, and migraines due to the higher visual contrast in the colors of buttons and links, as well as the new font, Chirp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H9zHjO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're making contrast changes on all buttons to make them easier on the eyes because you told us the new look is uncomfortable for people with sensory sensitivities. We're listening and iterating.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1426260504687824905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YiVFhC"&gt;The changes in contrast also included a black follow button that’s filled in if you’re not following someone, which has caused confusion for many people who are used to it being the other way around. It’s not clear yet if that change will be reversed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gszw06"&gt;As tends to happen any time a popular site changes its design, immediate reception to Twitter’s changes was mixed. It’s likely that some Twitter users would’ve gotten used to the update over time. But for those who say the new design has caused them pain, the change highlighted a common problem in online accessibility: a lack of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSc2Ih"&gt;Accessibility isn’t one size fits all; a feature that makes a site more accessible for one person can make it harder to use for another. High contrast is often useful for people who have low vision or are colorblind, but it can be painful for people who are sensitive to bright colors or light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mdpkKy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a great example of how some access needs routinely get centered over others within "accessible" processes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;High contrast is notoriously NOT accessible for many photosensitive &amp;amp; chronically pained folks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/c1AQNkMvC0"&gt;https://t.co/c1AQNkMvC0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alex Haagaard (they/them) (@alexhaagaard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhaagaard/status/1425594727429193732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aFS78x"&gt;There is no single most accessible option for Twitter’s interface. The best accessibility comes from flexibility, allowing users to choose the options that work for them. Twitter currently has toggles in its accessibility menu for settings like increased color contrast and reduced motion, as well as display settings that let people choose between light and dark themes or scale text sizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vboshr"&gt;It could save a lot of headaches if users had more granular options and could select the level of contrast that suits them, rather than having to wait on Twitter to make universal changes. Twitter didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, but its @TwitterA11y account has been &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1425831833892179969"&gt;soliciting feedback&lt;/a&gt; about the changes. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says its iCloud scanning will rely on multiple child safety groups to address privacy fears</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ia0PCmtxH75mxbYkGpWC9GLEEtk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69723200/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VHOhKl"&gt;Apple has filled in more details around its upcoming plans to scan iCloud Photos for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) via users’ iPhones and iPads. The company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FSecurity_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22623859%2Fapple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released a new paper&lt;/a&gt; delving into the safeguards it hopes will increase user trust in the initiative. That includes a rule to only flag images found in multiple child safety databases with different government affiliations — theoretically stopping one country from adding non-CSAM content to the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAlWLt"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iOS and iPadOS releases will automatically match US-based iCloud Photos accounts against known CSAM from a list of image hashes compiled by child safety groups. While many companies scan cloud storage services remotely, Apple’s device-based strategy has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;drawn sharp criticism&lt;/a&gt; from some cryptography and privacy experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNC7E2"&gt;The paper, called “Security Threat Model Review of Apple’s Child Safety Features,” hopes to allay privacy and security concerns around that rollout. It builds on &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt; with Apple executive Craig Federighi, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623336/craig-federighi-apple-icloud-photos-iphone-ipad-csam-scanning-auditability"&gt;outlined some of the information&lt;/a&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GWcN8"&gt;In the document, Apple says it won’t rely on a single government-affiliated database — like that of the US-based National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, or NCMEC — to identify CSAM. Instead, it will only match pictures from at least two groups with different national affiliations. The goal is that no single government could have the power to secretly insert unrelated content for censorship purposes, since it wouldn’t match hashes in any other database.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A venn diagram with one circle labeled “Apple Child Safety Organization #1 hash list,” one labeled “Child Safety Organization #2 hash list,” and the overlap labeled “Apple only uses the intersecting hashes of two or more child safety organizations.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfZtkVvGXvygEumbVZ86p-PnRRc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22781290/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_3.35.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fchild-safety%2Fpdf%2FSecurity_Threat_Model_Review_of_Apple_Child_Safety_Features.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22623859%2Fapple-icloud-photos-csam-scanning-security-multiple-jurisdictions-safeguard" target="_blank" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xv3FdB"&gt;Apple has referenced the potential use of multiple child safety databases, but until today, it hadn’t explained the overlap system. In a call with reporters, Apple said it’s only naming NCMEC because it hasn’t yet finalized agreements with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XByiVR"&gt;The paper confirms a detail Federighi mentioned: initially, Apple will only flag an iCloud account if it identifies 30 images as CSAM. This threshold was picked to provide a “drastic safety margin” to avoid false positives, the paper says — and as it evaluates the system’s performance in the real world, “we may change the threshold.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqgB8O"&gt;It also provides more information on an auditing system that Federighi mentioned. Apple’s list of known CSAM hashes will be baked into iOS and iPadOS worldwide, although the scanning system will only run in the US for now. Apple will provide a full list of hashes that auditors can check against child safety databases, another method to make sure it’s not secretly matching more images. Furthermore, it says it will “refuse all requests” for moderators to report “anything other than CSAM materials” for accounts that get flagged — referencing the potential for using this system for other kinds of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBhTTw"&gt;Federighi acknowledged that Apple had introduced “confusion” with its announcement last week. But Apple has stood by the update itself — it tells reporters that although it’s still finalizing and iterating on details, it hasn’t changed its launch plans in response to the past week’s criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nikola announces $2 million DOE grant after founder’s indictment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iDixNrGGE90b9o6nG1RMNCEf3is=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69715640/nikola_tre2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nikola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qC5F6U"&gt;This week hydrogen trucking startup Nikola announced that it won a $2 million grant from the Department of Energy. While the DoE &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-awarded-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-128"&gt;announced the grants in July&lt;/a&gt;, Nikola is promoting the news just two weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599726/nikola-founder-securities-fraud-charge-milton"&gt;founder and former chairman Trevor Milton was indicted for allegedly committing fraud&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oH6gxD"&gt;The grant is meant to help Nikola research autonomous refueling technologies for hydrogen refilling stations. It was awarded by the DOE’s Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy transportation office as part of its Hydrogen and Fuel Cells R&amp;amp;D program, which is focused on proving the reliability and sustainability of using hydrogen as a zero-emissions power source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdx303"&gt;The DOE grant comes at a time when the department is getting ready to ramp up funding activity to help advance the United States’ development of clean energy technologies — a priority under President Biden. One of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm’s &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/jennifer-granholm-interviews-energy-loans-5ceef97a73fc04fe3cca75bf84e91327"&gt;first moves&lt;/a&gt; after she was appointed was to revive the department’s loan program, which has been largely dormant since the early Obama administration. That program made a number of bets on clean energy startups in the aftermath of the recession that blew up in the administration’s face, like solar tech company Solyndra (which went bankrupt after China dramatically drove down the cost of solar panels) and Fisker Automotive (which went bankrupt after problems with its battery supplier). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X8J5Ab"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Biden administration is likely going to get pretty active with grants and loans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rAxugk"&gt;The DOE loan program also helped some companies survive the tumultuous years of the early clean tech boom, like Tesla. “If you want to have the leading electric vehicle manufacturer in the world... you’ll have to make multiple bets. And some of those bets will lead to losses,” new loan program head Jigar Shah said &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/how-jigar-shah-plans-to-manage-does-40b-loan-programs-office"&gt;when he was tapped earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s separate from the grant programs, the DOE loan program is known to be in discussions with at least one other troubled EV startup: Lordstown Motors, which has said for months now that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.tribtoday.com/news/local-news/2021/01/lmc-moves-forward-in-loan-program/"&gt;in the “due diligence” phase of a request from about $200 million&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzuBGC"&gt;Nikola has spent much of the last year trying to rebound from Milton’s ousting, which came after he was accused of lying about the progress the startup had made by the time it went public. Short-selling research firm Hindenburg Research published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;report last September&lt;/a&gt; that tried to make the case that Nikola was an “intricate fraud,” including the now famous claim that the startup had staged a video showing one of its trucks operating by secretly rolling it down a hill. The report torpedoed General Motors’ decision to take an 11 percent stake in Nikola, and Milton resigned soon after. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w13FDS"&gt;Nikola eventually performed &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-02-26/money-stuff-startups-sometimes-stretch-the-truth"&gt;an internal investigation that confirmed Milton had lied, a lot&lt;/a&gt;, and the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission opened investigations into his claims. Last month, they filed parallel criminal and civil charges against Milton as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMdHb9"&gt;Nikola is still losing around $100 million per quarter, and it had around $630 million in the bank at the end of the second quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ku7Lzd"&gt;“Autonomous fueling is part of the industry’s effort to ensure fast, efficient, and safe fueling of a large onboard storage system to be less than 20 minutes for heavy-duty vehicles,” the company &lt;a href="https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-awarded-u-s-department-of-energy-grant-128"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This project is expected to address this goal by working to develop an autonomous fueling system that can rapidly refuel heavy-duty fuel-cell electric trucks, while minimizing labor and challenges relating to ergonomics and maintenance of equipment, as compared to an equivalent manual fueling process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdsyJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction (August 13th, 3:xxPM ET):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this story said the grant was announced after Milton’s indictment two weeks ago. It was first announced &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/fuelcells/articles/hydrogen-and-fuel-cells-rd-fy-2021-foa-selections"&gt;&lt;em&gt;on July 7th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; by the Department of Energy. The Verge regrets the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is pausing its verification program again, after giving fake accounts blue checks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8fEvYvpDPIMP6vWxTlFU7D5Qkg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722843/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gTlpAf"&gt;Twitter is once again putting a halt on applications to its verification program, saying that it needs to work on the application and review process that lets people into the blue check mark club. This change is coming after Twitter admitted that several fake accounts, which reportedly seemed to be part of a botnet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575025/twitter-verified-fake-accounts-botnet-researcher"&gt;were incorrectly verified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FcbAJ"&gt;If you’ve recently applied for verification, there is a chance you’ll get it — Twitter Verified has said that it’ll &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426227102957907968?s=20"&gt;still be reviewing existing applications&lt;/a&gt;, so the freeze is just preventing new people from being able to apply. Twitter hasn’t indicated that it’ll be making changes to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;the criteria that it uses to deem accounts as verifiable or not&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B18jY4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’ve temporarily hit pause on rolling out access to apply for Verification so we can make improvements to the application and review process.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For those who have been waiting, we know this may be disappointing. We want to get things right, and appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Verified (@verified) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/verified/status/1426214732403466241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EIT3Ly"&gt;This isn’t the first time Twitter has paused its verification program — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16628290/twitter-jason-kessler-charlottesville-verification"&gt;put the public process on hold in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, after it received backlash for verifying one of the organizers behind the Unite The Right rally in Charlottesville. It brought back a revamped version in 2021 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458914/twitter-verification-pause-applications-relaunch"&gt;and paused it a week later&lt;/a&gt; due to an avalanche of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tlHHZ"&gt;The start-stop issues Twitter has been having with its Verified program speak to the difficulties that can come with issuing a badge that is sometimes regarded by users as an endorsement. Twitter says that the purpose of the badge is to show that an account is “authentic, notable, and active,&lt;strong&gt;” &lt;/strong&gt;but even those criteria can end up courting controversy when people who are arguably notable get their applications rejected (especially when obviously fake accounts make it through). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Sonos survey suggests the company might build a voice assistant of its own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ActEr77jd6OZgmI3vqxDCuQNIBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722510/RoamSidetable.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZHR0U7"&gt;Sonos might be developing a voice assistant alternative to Alexa or Google Assistant for its speakers, according to &lt;a href="https://voicebot.ai/2021/08/10/sonos-surveys-users-about-potential-voice-assistant/"&gt;a customer survey spotted by &lt;em&gt;VoiceBot.ai&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The survey, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/p17y3y/sonos_acquisition_of_snips/h8c0taz?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;a Sonos customer on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, describes an on-device voice control system that would improve user privacy by &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; routing questions and commands through the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I1av7"&gt;In the survey (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/g0652ei?nc=1"&gt;pictured below&lt;/a&gt; thanks to Reddit user EdmundFitzgerald29), Sonos writes that its “potential new product offering” would use the wake word “Hey Sonos” and let users control playback, search through songs, and move music to other speakers with their voice. The survey claims that the assistant can respond faster because it would be processing everything on device, rather than relying on an internet connection and sending queries to a server.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRtQ4YvzY0SPHA_XL5tEbZFllIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780810/sonossurvey.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EdmundFitzgerald29/" target="_blank"&gt;EdmundFitzgerald29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonos’ survey asking for customer input on a new voice control system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2qIp55"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked for comment on whether the survey was real, Sonos said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8XlL9E"&gt;We regularly put product and experience concepts in front of our customers to better understand what is important to them. We don’t have anything further to share at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HM3Yd7"&gt;There’s some reason to believe Sonos would work on a project like this. Sonos acquired its own AI voice-platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975607/sonos-buys-snips-ai-voice-assistant-privacy"&gt;in the form of Snips in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Snips’ privacy-focused tech — notably doing all processing on device — sounds a lot like the feature Sonos is now reportedly pitching to customers. Sonos also has a reason to want to provide an independent voice solution — it’s had a public falling out with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18174686/sonos-google-assistant-beam-one-beta-demo-features-ces-2019"&gt;one of its voice control partners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMfFXe"&gt;Sonos claims Google stole some of its multiroom audio tech during a Google Music partnership in 2013. The company apparently warned Google that it was infringing on patents during multiple Google Chromecast and Home speaker launches, but Google didn’t listen. Now the conflict is playing out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; started by Sonos in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mv7aC"&gt;It’s not clear when or if Sonos plans to introduce its own voice control system, but based on the survey, which highlights compatibility with Amazon’s Alexa and not Google Assistant, it seems like Sonos would like Google to take less of a central role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVSKhm"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Immunocompromised people should get a third COVID-19 vaccine dose, CDC committee says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York City Offers $100 Incentive For New Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ee57whWR6YLmhFAh2GoGbXmsAr4=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722373/1331502468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZKF36"&gt;Immunocompromised people should get a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention committee recommended today.  After taking only a standard, two-dose series of the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, patients may not generate enough antibodies against the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rNzaz"&gt;“I have known of patients who are immunocompromised and in the hospital, they did all the right things. They’re just suffering from a lack of good vaccine protection,” says Camille Kotton, clinical director of transplant and immunocompromised host infectious diseases at the Massachusetts General Hospital, during the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="IzKsXs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4yvST"&gt;The decision follows the Food and Drug Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22620757/booster-covid-vaccine-immunocompromised-fda"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; late Thursday night that it has amended the emergency use authorization for both vaccines to allow the additional third shot for people who have received solid organ transplants or who have conditions that impair the immune system to a similar degree. There are no changes for the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson one-shot vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AH2Nzp"&gt;Around 7 million adults in the United States are &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/02-COVID-Dooling-508.pdf"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;. They’re more likely to get seriously ill from COVID-19, are more likely to have breakthrough infections even if vaccinated, and the vaccines aren’t as effective for them. People considered moderately or severely immunocompromised &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-08-13/03-COVID-Goswami-508.pdf"&gt;include people&lt;/a&gt; who have received organ transplants, in treatment for some cancers, and who take immunosuppressive medications like high-dose corticosteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgOwEz"&gt;Immunocompromised people shouldn’t need a doctor’s note or prescription to get a third dose, says Kathleen Dooling, a medical officer at the CDC. “This is self-attesting,” she told attendees at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="List of immunosuppressive conditions that could qualify for a third dose. Active treatment for solid tumor and hematologic malignancies, receipt of solid-organ transplant and taking immunosuppressive therapy, receipt of CAR-T-cell or hematopoietic stem cell transplant (within 2 years of transplantation or taking immunosuppression therapy), moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency, advanced or untreated HIV infection, active treatment with biologic agents that are immunosuppressive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgKzQ_0qW-qxgsqOTPEZgtKDeDc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780870/Screen_Shot_2021_08_13_at_12.31.05_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A presentation at the ACIP meeting lists the conditions that could qualify for a third dose.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O9OAX8"&gt;A third shot increases the proportion of immunocompromised people who produce antibodies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;research shows&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s still not clear if or how much that antibody boost translates to prevention of COVID-19 for this group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7TdBw"&gt;Even with a third dose, people who are immunocompromised should still take precautions against COVID-19. While the boost will likely give them some additional protection, they’d still be at high risk for a severe case of COVID-19 should they contract the disease. “Immunocompromised people should continue to wear a mask, stay six feet apart from others they don’t live with, and avoid crowds and poorly ventilated indoor spaces,” Dooling says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzgwoh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony HT-A7000 review: a next-gen Atmos soundbar that’s (almost) perfect for gaming</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For those who can afford to throw cash at something that sounds great&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6PLwbl"&gt;A $1,300 soundbar doesn’t have much room for compromises. You can spend a fraction of that on a perfectly competent Vizio soundbar, and even premium options like the Sonos Arc cost hundreds less. There will always be people that balk at the notion of spending so much money and not putting it toward a traditional surround sound system — and that’s especially true (and a fair argument) when you reach this price level. So when designing its latest flagship 7.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar, &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-sound-bar-home-theater/all-home-theater-sound-bar/p/hta7000"&gt;the HT-A7000&lt;/a&gt;, Sony knew it couldn’t settle and had to throw in the entire kitchen sink to justify the steep investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qETMQZ"&gt;And that’s exactly what the company tried to do. The HT-A7000, which starts shipping in September, embraces gamers with &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; HDMI 2.1 passthrough inputs capable of 8K, 4K at 120Hz, and Dolby Vision HDR. There are still very few soundbars on the market that are so well optimized for next-gen consoles like the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X / S. You can plug &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; Sony and Microsoft’s consoles into the HT-A7000 and enjoy their full visual fidelity — with one unfortunate exception that I’ll explain later. If your TV cruelly only has a single HDMI 2.1 / eARC port, Sony’s new soundbar gives you an extra one. That’s something the Arc or lower-priced soundbars can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Ty8k"&gt;Sony has also stuffed this soundbar with practically every way to stream music you could possibly want. Bluetooth and a 3.5mm aux port really aren’t going to cut it for this much scratch, so you also get Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Spotify Connect, plus the option to integrate the HT-A7000 with your Google Home or Amazon Alexa systems. You can pair a set of Bluetooth headphones to the soundbar and listen that way to avoid disturbing anyone. There’s a USB port if you want to plug in a drive that contains your FLAC collection or whatever local audio you feel like playing. The soundbar also supports pretty much every home theater audio codec under the sun, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vJQJoa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10700005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HoZJNC"&gt;The HT-A7000 is about as future-proofed and loaded with tech as soundbars come. It’s not intended for home theater enthusiasts who want to carefully consider and piece together every individual component of their ideal surround system. This is for the sort of person already splurging on a Sony A90J OLED with enough disposable income to add Sony’s top-tier soundbar to their cart. But to really, truly get the most from the HT-A7000, you’ll also eventually want the optional set of &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sars3s"&gt;wireless rear speakers&lt;/a&gt; ($349.99) and standalone subwoofer (&lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sasw3"&gt;$399.99 for 200W&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/soundbars/p/sasw5"&gt;$699.99 for 300W&lt;/a&gt;). All in, the bundle of products I reviewed would cost $2,349.97 before tax. That’s about the same as buying one of those high-end Sony OLED TVs I mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEoRHb"&gt;So while testing the HT-A7000, I’ve gone about it in two different configurations: I’ve used the soundbar by itself plenty since some buyers will just stop there. But I’ve also put the kitted out, exorbitantly priced system through its paces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48xVxI"&gt;HT-A7000 on its own&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bCL9Ah"&gt;When set up by itself, the HT-A7000 is a 7.1.2 soundbar. That breaks down into five front-facing speakers plus two beam tweeters (7), a built-in subwoofer (1), and the pair of upward-firing Atmos speakers (2). For comparison, the Sonos Arc is a 5.0.2 speaker (and becomes 5.1.2 if you add a Sub to the equation). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WqXbfKZmlovKnx2_wfUMiRF8ICg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780495/DSCF4584_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s HT-A7000 is an Atmos 7.1.2 soundbar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQsSGx"&gt;It certainly &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; the part of a premium soundbar, though I’ll let you decide whether the glass top surface and mix of textures and materials are befitting of the price. On top are capacitive touch buttons for power, input, volume, Bluetooth, and so on. And behind the HT-A7000’s front grill is a small display that shows what input it’s playing from (HDMI 1, 2, or TV) and shows the volume or sound mode when you’re making adjustments. When you’re watching something through one of the two passthrough HDMI ports, you can hit the remote’s “display” button for a summary on your TV screen that details the current audio signal and whether the vertical speakers are active. When the soundbar is outputting TV audio, you’ll see those details on the tiny front display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LwauUP"&gt;Around back is the arsenal of ports: two HDMI in, one HDMI out, inputs for analog and optical audio, a USB type-A port, and power. Aside from the bundled remote control and HDMI cable, Sony also includes brackets and screws for the HT-A7000 in the box if you want to wall-mount it. I can’t really find any faults with the remote: it’s very Sony, but at least there are individual buttons for both HDMI inputs and all the sound modes you’ll use most often. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0COLOydwA0CAqdPGcuV03wPuQ7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780498/DSCF4564.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are touch controls on the soundbar’s glass surface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B47h5c"&gt;Setting up the soundbar was quite simple thanks to Sony’s on-screen instructions. I plugged in the devices I wanted to run through the soundbar, plugged it into my LG CX’s eARC port, and I was good to go. In terms of sound performance, the HT-A7000 ranks up there with the very best Atmos soundbars. I felt it my duty to shell out the $20 to rent &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt; and experience big Hollywood blockbuster action, and I wasn’t disappointed. Car chases and action sequences are enthralling when coming out of this 7.1.2 bar, and it does manage to provide a distinct feeling of sweeping surround effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D14JsX"&gt;I also spent some time watching &lt;em&gt;Dave Matthews &amp;amp; Tim Reynolds: Live at Radio City&lt;/em&gt; — a Blu-ray I’ve seen used as a demo at audio briefings more than once. Both acoustic guitars came through with warmth, terrific detail, and just the right kind of jangle. The vocals stayed crisp and distinct in the center channel throughout every song. Sony’s S-Force Pro Surround and Vertical Surround Engine technologies do a good job of dispersing sound around the room when you’re watching anything that has a surround mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9X8k4UfcU7QWqovBljw3UrdX81g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780572/DSCF4603.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A7000 is quite a bit larger than the Sonos Arc. For scale, behind both is a 55-inch TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DipeAL"&gt;The immersion factor grew more impressive when I watched Atmos content from Netflix or through my Movies Anywhere library. Sony has a “sound field optimization” process that helps the soundbar tune itself for your room. It plays a few loud noises that help the device detect how far away the walls to its left and right are (like Sonos’ TruePlay tuning system), and it detects ceiling distance as well. (You can manually input these numbers if you’ve measured for yourself and want to make sure they’re perfect.) With more drivers at its disposal, the Sony outperformed my Sonos Arc — though not by as nearly as much as I expected considering the $500 price gap. The effect of the height channels was very similar in both speakers. Sony includes different sound modes like auto, standard, cinema, and others like “voice” that emphasize dialogue or “night,” which limits the boominess when you’re watching at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rq-XieEMSrtYY1PLHRNbpkOaqOs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780591/DSCF4572.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A small display shows volume adjustments, what mode the soundbar is in, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCBoxM6LGSfeAK8tP-MGj7-4Tow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780680/DSCF4614.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HT-A7000 comes with an extremely Sony remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MRBfT4"&gt;Surprisingly there’s no preset audio mode for gaming. But even so, the HT-A7000 kicked out powerful audio when I was playing &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;on PS5, with no noticeable audio and video sync issues. Switching over to my Xbox Series X, the story was the same. Passthrough largely worked flawlessly, with the soundbar correctly detected different audio codecs being sent from games and streaming apps on the game console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLIvHE"&gt;But then I realized something was off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mctkj6"&gt;See, one area where the HT-A7000 falters with gaming is a familiar one for Sony: variable refresh rate. Currently, the soundbar is incapable of passthrough for both VRR and ALLM (auto low latency mode). That’s a significant downside for owners of the Xbox Series X or Series S; both consoles can use VRR to help smoothen out any dips in frame rate as you play. &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; felt noticeably more choppy when played through the soundbar without VRR. Sony told me that it recommends Xbox owners plug directly into an HDMI 2.1 port on their TV. The PS5 still doesn’t offer support for VRR, so if that’s your chosen console, you’re not really losing out on much right now. Either way, you’ll need to make sure you apply the ideal settings for gaming to whatever HDMI port the HT-A7000 is running into, since the lack of ALLM passthrough will keep your TV from making those changes automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBDdIR"&gt;The omission of VRR and ALLM passthrough is enough to prevent the HT-A7000 from being the &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; soundbar for next-gen gaming that I hoped it might be, which is unfortunate. It’s a great match for PS5 at the moment, but losing VRR on Xbox is hard to swallow for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fUPt9b"&gt;With the optional subwoofer and rear surrounds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n2zDg0"&gt;As capable as the HT-A7000 is by its lonesome, more speakers are always better when it comes to home theater. Adding in the wireless soundbar and rear surrounds was painless; the soundbar automatically detects them and starts feeding audio to them immediately. (The soundbar’s remote control has buttons for the add-ons, too.) All the virtualization tech in the world still can’t compete with discrete speakers placed behind you, and I got the most enjoyment out of Sony’s new system with the added gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dll7Sm0JxSA4a7C65GcuXYsdRE8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780747/DSCF4620_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s optional rear surround speakers and subwoofer unlock the HT-A7000’s full potential.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IXzv9f"&gt;I wish the rear surrounds had up-firing Atmos drivers, like the rears that come with Vizio’s Elevate bar do, but nope. They’re just traditional stereo speakers. Sony’s 300W subwoofer can push out some truly growling, reverberating bass. It’s frankly too much for my Brooklyn apartment, but if you’re not at risk of annoying the neighbors, it’s a thrill to unleash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="VbXT2s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10700063"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mNPsPb"&gt;The fully fleshed system is a joy for movies and TV shows, but it also makes a noticeable difference for 360 Reality Audio and Dolby Atmos music, which is all the rage lately. You can really sense the unique placement and details when listening on a proper surround system. Apple Music’s spatial audio feels less gimmicky in this context than it does when listening through headphones. Other features of the HT-A7000 like Chromecast and AirPlay 2 have worked just fine, though keep in mind they’re only there for audio playback on this device and not video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvCNk5"&gt;Sony’s HT-A7000 is a wonderful, powerful soundbar, but it comes at a hefty premium that a lot of people will never seriously consider when options like the Sonos Arc and Vizio Elevate offer excellent performance for considerably less. I can’t help but think that Sony should have included either the rear speakers or subwoofer in the box with this one. Having to tack everything on separately makes the whole proposition an even tougher sell as you cross the $2,000 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="f93w2X"&gt;The level of future-proofing here is impressive. But since my LG CX has four HDMI 2.1 ports, I already had everything I needed with my Arc, Xbox Series X, and PS5. The passthrough aspect of the HT-A7000 isn’t a big selling point for me, though it does work as advertised — except for the VRR situation. If that asterisk weren’t present, I’d feel more comfortable labeling the HT-A7000 as worthy of the price for those who can swing it and want a simple path to sublime home theater audio. If you’re not an Xbox gamer, maybe it’s still worthy of that title. This is a soundbar that truly does everything. But it comes at such a premium that anything less than perfection is a reason for pause and closely examining other options. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lamborghini Countach, the poster car of ‘80s luxury, is back — and it’s a hybrid</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3H-P_u9kb_6NL7wsNpVu1gCbT04=/814x0:5358x3029/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69722200/COUNTACH_LPI800_4__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Somebody get a doctor, this Lambo is sick&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YlHGil"&gt;Lamborghini unveiled its revamped Countach supercar at Pebble Beach this week, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616693/lamborghini-countach-teaser-hybrid-supercar"&gt;as predicted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s rocking a little lightning under the hood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O02q59"&gt;The limited edition supercar is called the Countach LPI 800-4, with LPI standing for Longitudinale Posteriore Ibrido, or Longitudinal Posterior Hybrid; 800 referring to the rounding down of the engine’s 814cv maximum combined power; and 4 to its permanent four-wheel drive transmission. The automaker is releasing the revamped version in honor of the 50th anniversary of the original release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmAnyK"&gt;The revived Countach will have an aspirated V12 engine with a 48V electric motor — meaning the supercar will retain its familiar engine growl while also receiving some of its power from electrons. According to Lamborghini, the thermal unit will have an output of 780cv (a metric unit of horsepower that translates to 574kW), while the e-motor will generate 34cv. That produces a 0–100km/h time of 2.8 seconds, a 0–200km/h time of 8.6 seconds, and a top speed of 355km/h. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e0veRE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10700038"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TOXkKS"&gt;To be sure, the Countach’s hybrid system isn’t anything new; it’s based on the &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2019/09/21/lamborghini-sian-hybrid-system-explained-details/"&gt;supercapacitor technology used in Lamborghini’s Sián&lt;/a&gt;. Lamborghini claims this provides three-times the power of a lithium-ion battery with the same weight. Notably, it does not reflect the new hybrid and pure-electric vehicle systems that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440143/lamborghini-ev-electric-supercar-hybrid-models-announce"&gt;Italian automaker is currently working on&lt;/a&gt;, which will underpin Lamborghini’s new batch of hybrids and EVs to be released later this decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOWxON"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the patriarch of modern super sports car design”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1Baa4"&gt;Lamborghini calls the Countach “the patriarch of modern super sports car design,” and indeed its distinctive wedge shape and sleek, villainous lines proved to be a popular cultural touchstone for many growing up in the 1970s and ‘80s. If you didn’t have &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Generic-Lamborghini-Countach-Poster/dp/B086JCKN8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a poster of the Countach&lt;/a&gt; on your wall, you definitely knew someone who did. And if you dreamed about striking it rich and buying a mansion someday, that image most likely included a Countach in your five-car garage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mul67p"&gt;The new Countach pays homage to its predecessor, “but it is not retrospective,” Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said in a statement. “It upholds the Lamborghini tradition of looking forward, of exploring new design and technology avenues while celebrating the DNA of our brand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlFArQ0k7aPIFHHAm1XYA8kv-hY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780672/Countach_LPI_800_4_Outdoor__6_.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The new Countach is less angular than its predecessor, but maintains its wedge-shape. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQf3y68wyRWIM2YMNYrQtiX7vc0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780676/Countach_LPI_800_4_Outdoor__32_.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The revived Countach will be a limited run; Lamborghini is only making 112 units.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XRZwvp"&gt;Viewed side by side, the revived Countach isn’t as sharply angled as its forebear, with a rounder nose and a less severe-looking rear. There’s no spoiler, and the airscoops are integrated in the shoulders of the car, embellished with Lamborghini’s distinctive slatted “gills.” Still, Lamborghini did a decent job updating the look while retaining the shape and overall feel of the classic supercar.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pIjizo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lamborghini did a decent job updating the look &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dji9PO"&gt;The chassis and body panels are made out of carbon fiber, giving the Countach LPI 800-4 a dry weight of 1,595kg (3,516lbs) for a dry weight to power ratio of 1.95kg/cv. Carbon fiber is also featured in the front splitter, around the front window and side-view mirrors, engine bonnet cover intakes, and rocker panels, as well as in the interior. Lamborghini used #D-printing to produce movable air vents and a “photochromatic” roof, which can shift from solid to transparent at the touch of a button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OymRE_tPTUXD0tj1i-VlX9VyL_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780712/Countach_LPI800_4_Interior_8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Lamborghini&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;There’s an 8.4-inch touchscreen inside, but honestly who’s paying attention to such trivial details. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZeu8t"&gt;Inside, an 8.4-inch touchscreen manages the car’s controls. The operating system is compatible with Apple CarPlay. But let’s face it, if you’re rich enough to own this car, pairing the OS to your smartphone is not your highest priority. Tearing ass through the Italian countryside is what this is really about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRz3h0"&gt;But then again, these images are likely to be as close as we ever get to this car. Lamborghini is only making 112 units, a reference to the “LP 112” internal project name used during the original Lamborghini Countach’s development. Deliveries will begin in the first quarter of 2022, and no, Lamborghini is not revealing the sticker price. Probably for the best; I’m not sure my blood pressure could handle it. &lt;/p&gt;
