    <title>A streamer completed a sweet, juicy Hades run using a literal pomegranate controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUTR9UEmkcppnZp_k44JK-2h2Go=/245x107:2635x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838631/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_9.01.42_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rudeism&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZmNE5X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, Supergiant Games’ Greek-themed roguelike, can be a pretty tough game. But one intrepid Twitch streamer took it upon himself to up the challenge by beating the game in an incredibly nontraditional way: by using a controller made out of an actual pomegranate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFQXBj"&gt;Pomegranates are a big part of the game, serving as &lt;a href="https://hades.gamepedia.com/Pom_of_Power"&gt;useful power-ups&lt;/a&gt;, and they also have an &lt;a href="https://life.spectator.co.uk/articles/pomegranate-fruit-myths-made/"&gt;important place in Greek mythology&lt;/a&gt;. But I never imagined that someone could use a real-life pomegranate to defeat the final boss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7kEiK"&gt;To make the controller, streamer Dylan “Rudeism” Beck cut up a pomegranate into 10 pieces, wired the pieces to a &lt;a href="https://makeymakey.com/"&gt;MakeyMakey circuit board&lt;/a&gt; to make them act as capacitive touch buttons, and taped an earth wire from his arm to the board. Here’s how the contraption works, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM?t=221"&gt;according to Beck&lt;/a&gt;: “My arm will be connected to the MakeyMakey via the earth wire, and then when I touch one of the pomegranates, it then creates a loop between me, the pomegranate, and the circuit board, and that’s what does inputs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irc0rK"&gt;You can watch Beck put the controller together (and make his first attempt to beat the game with it) in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/QEg3iC1O_HM"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8MTdMb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QEg3iC1O_HM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=257&amp;amp;start=257" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tZHL5k"&gt;Beck first tried to play the game with a pomegranate &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911752639"&gt;six days ago&lt;/a&gt;, and he has been &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/913264431"&gt;grinding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/917393094"&gt;runs&lt;/a&gt; ever since, chasing an elusive escape from the Underworld. Overnight, Beck finally did it, successfully defeating the game’s final boss in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rudeism/status/1362376886827896832"&gt;an epic battle&lt;/a&gt; that included two heart-stopping controller failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Dtgcs1"&gt;

&lt;p id="5vcxDS"&gt;This isn’t Beck’s first attempt at playing a game with a nontraditional controller — it’s actually &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Rudeism/videos"&gt;kind of his thing&lt;/a&gt;. Among other notable feats, he won a round of the adorable battle royale platformer &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/JDH8KC2vCxY"&gt;jelly beans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Older Pixel phones are having serious camera issues, according to owners</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google’s Pixel 2" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AcioPDPYC-0AZskGoMsZWdtHwR8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838515/jbareham_171013_2050_0044.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The issue appears to affect the Pixel 2 series, but may be spreading to newer phones. | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5e9POr"&gt;Some owners of previous-generation Pixel phones are having serious trouble with their cameras. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/02/16/hardware-failures-may-be-to-blame-for-increase-in-reports-of-pixel-camera-issues/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; has noticed&lt;/a&gt; a recent increase in one-star &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera"&gt;Play Store reviews&lt;/a&gt; for the camera app used by the Pixel, with frustrated owners saying the camera often crashes upon opening or no longer works at all. A &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/70290821?hl=en"&gt;thread in Google’s Pixel support forum&lt;/a&gt; features similar complaints. The Pixel 2 XL seems to be cited most often for experiencing the problem, but some posters say they’re having trouble with devices as recent as the 3 or 4A. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5FVU6"&gt;It’s not an entirely new problem. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/25/pixel-2-camera-curse-continues-and-its-spreading-to-newer-pixels/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; has been tracking camera issues&lt;/a&gt; that have plagued Pixel 2 phones primarily over the last year, and it notes more devices seem to be affected now. Owners say that Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/6306624?hl=en"&gt;suggested fixes&lt;/a&gt; don’t remedy the problem and that they experience the same problem when using third-party camera apps. The Pixel 2 series &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164027/google-pixel-2-final-update-security-patch-november-2020"&gt;recently got its last security update&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no logical reason why the camera should stop functioning as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AICHpW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Owners say Google’s suggested fixes don’t remedy the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="75UomK"&gt;It’s an unfortunate bug, especially considering that many folks chose a Pixel phone because of its high-quality camera. While Pixel image quality has fallen behind other flagship competition recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;budget devices like the 4A&lt;/a&gt; and 4A 5G offer some of the best cameras in their class. But the best camera is the one that keeps functioning when you need it, so we hope to see Google address these user concerns. We’ve reached out to Google asking for confirmation of the issue and if a fix is on the way and will update this article with any information we get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tech groups are suing to halt Maryland’s new digital services tax</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="justice-building-federal-government" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s965D6DRPzdwmUgtn8TrCJp4zlc=/3x0:1022x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838503/justice-federal-government.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="semjRE"&gt;A coalition of tech and business groups have joined together for a lawsuit challenging Maryland’s newly passed digital services tax, as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/18/amazon-facebook-google-maryland-lawsuit-tax/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22312984/document_20_.pdf"&gt;filed in federal district court in Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, argues the state tax is preempted by federal law and violates various constitutional prohibitions against state taxes on out-of-state activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii4qjb"&gt;The lawsuit is led by the US Chamber of Commerce, which is joined by three tech industry groups: Internet Association, NetChoice, and Computer &amp;amp; Communications Industry Association. Membership varies, but &lt;a href="https://internetassociation.org/our-members/"&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://netchoice.org/"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ccianet.org/about/members/"&gt;associations&lt;/a&gt; count Google, Facebook, and Amazon as members, as well as other tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cYNC"&gt;The Maryland law would establish a new gross revenue tax on digital advertising undertaken by non-media companies — targeted squarely at the ad revenue collected by tech giants like Facebook and Google. The tax rate varies depending on the size of the company, but it would range as high as 10 percent for companies with global annual revenue higher than $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6o698j"&gt;Prior to passage, a number of state politicians raised concerns about the legality of the bill — most notably Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, who identified “some risk that a reviewing court would find that the tax is unconstitutional” in &lt;a href="http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/2020RS/ag_letters/hb0732.pdf"&gt;a public letter in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="unB15O"&gt;Maryland Gov. Lawrence Hogan opposed the bill, but the state’s General Assembly &lt;a href="https://www.stateandlocaltax.com/digital-economy/the-latest-on-marylands-digital-advertising-tax/"&gt;overrode his veto&lt;/a&gt; to pass it into law on February 12th. The tax is set to go into effect 30 days after passage unless the lawsuit’s injunction is successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGKDYg"&gt;Digital tax proposals have become increasingly common as tech giants have grown more profitable and less popular — but the taxes remained hotly contested by the tech industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418114/european-uk-digital-tax-services-apple-google-amazon-raise-prices"&gt;A UK digital service tax passed in 2020&lt;/a&gt; resulted in enterprise rate hikes from many US tech companies, while the staggered implementation of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-digital-tax-detente-ends-as-u-s-and-france-exchange-blows-11609333200"&gt;France’s digital services tax&lt;/a&gt; has sparked a standoff with US trade officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8g4xWi"&gt;Then-presidential candidate Andrew Yang proposed a US digital services tax &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964834/andrew-yang-digital-ads-tax-elizabeth-warren-antitrust-tech-facebook-google"&gt;as part of his 2020 primary campaign&lt;/a&gt;, but the idea has failed to gain traction among US lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Office 2021, available for Windows and macOS later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YF8Vc7q-zF5_EBrvgAAHWYwsXxg=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838438/officeicons.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZrKXVy"&gt;Microsoft is announcing two new versions of Office today: a consumer Office 2021 version and Office LTSC for commercial customers. Office 2021 will be available later this year for both Windows and macOS, and similar to the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16366150/microsoft-office-2019-features-release-date"&gt;Office 2019 release&lt;/a&gt;, it’s designed for those who don’t want to subscribe to the cloud-powered Microsoft 365 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDkfb8"&gt;Microsoft isn’t fully detailing all of the features and changes in Office 2021 just yet, but the Office LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) variant will include things like dark mode support, accessibility improvements, and features like Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP in Excel. Office 2021 will include similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfpTfQ"&gt;Don’t expect any major UI changes here, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274181/microsoft-word-dark-mode-canvas-update-beta"&gt;Dark mode&lt;/a&gt; is the obvious change visually, but Microsoft will still focus most of its interface and cloud-powered features on the Microsoft 365 versions of Office first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvPrM3"&gt;Office LTSC is a clear recognition from Microsoft that not all of its business customers are ready to move to the cloud, though. “It’s just a matter of trying to meet customers where they are,” explains Jared Spataro, head of Microsoft 365, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We certainly have a lot of customers that have moved to the cloud over the last 10 months, that’s happened en masse really. At the same time, we definitely have customers who have specific scenarios where they don’t feel like they can move to the cloud.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiuHh63G8T-dKETHBFhCc8EiKm8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22291771/darkmodenewquick.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new dark mode in Word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qcnLxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This next Office release is for those who don’t want Microsoft 365&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Io6Q"&gt;Those specific scenarios include regulated industries where processes and apps can’t change on a monthly basis, or manufacturing plants that rely on Office and want a locked-in time release. Microsoft is also committing to another perpetual version of Office for the future, but it’s changing up pricing and how these new versions will be supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGxMvi"&gt;Office LTSC will now only be supported for five years instead of the seven that Microsoft has typically provided for Office. Pricing for Office Professional Plus, Office Standard, and individual apps is also increasing 10 percent for commercial customers, with the Office 2021 consumer and small business pricing remaining the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzv3zj"&gt;The Office LTSC support timing aligns more closely with how Windows is supported, and Microsoft is also aligning its release schedules for both Office and Windows more closely as a result. Both of the next versions of Office LTSC and Windows 10 LTSC will be released in the second half of 2021. “They will be closely timed, although we don’t have the details yet for the Windows release,” says Spataro. “The idea is to bring them close together so that enterprises can deploy and manage them on a similar type of cadence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3VZbb"&gt;Microsoft is now planning to release a preview of Office LTSC in April, with a full release later this year. The consumer Office 2021 variant won’t be available in preview, though. Both of the new Office variants will also ship with OneNote and include 32-bit and 64-bit versions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s 360-degree Mars landing broadcast is now live from the best seat in the house</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HH6oov2vI_Aw9rvIfaBCly_ajIo=/253x0:2608x1570/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838419/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_11.40.57_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YYFedF"&gt;NASA is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287160/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-landing-watch-live-stream-start-time"&gt;landing a rover on Mars today&lt;/a&gt;, February 18th, but if you’re looking for a different perspective than the traditional live stream, &lt;a href="https://t.co/58eLesCdfs?amp=1"&gt;the space agency is currently streaming the scene from inside mission control&lt;/a&gt; — in an immersive 360 degrees. You can look around to watch people as they go about their work, but there are also big virtual screens displaying multiple other views, including NASA’s other live stream. It might be the best way to experience the landing because you’ll get it all simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1FbMz"&gt;At the time of writing, the stream is broadcasting interviews with key mission staff, explaining the purpose of today’s landing, as well as some of the technical jargon that’ll start getting thrown around once Perseverance begins its descent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eftrs2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Mars Landing LIVE in 360º&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s landing day in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; and it’s as if you’re right here with us. Get a view from inside our Mission Control as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt;’s team works through the toughest Mars landing yet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best via the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTube&lt;/a&gt; app: &lt;a href="https://t.co/58eLesCdfs"&gt;https://t.co/58eLesCdfs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/A2AMs36JUW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A2AMs36JUW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1362480953336098816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEt8QX"&gt;NASA has offered a 360-degree stream inside Mission Control for other missions before, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0yOTanzx-s&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;including its 2018 InSight Mars landing&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s still a really neat experience to see inside the control room, especially during such a historic mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLcgyP"&gt;If you want to see something akin to what a rover can see on the planet itself, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937050/nasa-mars-curiosity-rover-360-degree-video-tour"&gt;also has previously produced 360-degree views from the surface of Mars&lt;/a&gt;. And if you’d rather watch mission control from a more produced, less “choose your own” perspective, NASA &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPrbJ63qUc4"&gt;has a “clean” live stream as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F4mfjN"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;em&gt;The Trial of the Chicago 7 &lt;/em&gt;will be available for free on its YouTube channel for 48 hours, starting on Friday, February 19th, at 12AM PT, &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/the-whole-world-was-and-is-watching"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company (&lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-the-trial-of-the-chicago-7-free-on-youtube-48-hours-video/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wrap&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Writer and director Aaron Sorkin said the movie is being shown for free to “commemorate the anniversary of the verdict in this historic trial,” and he praised the people depicted in the movie as “the real patriots who inspired a generation — actually, generations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufL1QF"&gt;The film centers on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Seven"&gt;the eight Vietnam war protestors&lt;/a&gt; who were charged with inciting a riot and conspiracy for demonstrating during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Sorkin is no stranger to political subject matter, notably working on &lt;em&gt;The West Wing &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Few Good Men&lt;/em&gt;, even though he’s perhaps better known for films like &lt;em&gt;The Social Network&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Steve Jobs&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZOK5o"&gt;This isn’t the first time Netflix has made some of its content free on YouTube. Last April, it made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225143/netflix-doumentaries-free-youtube-our-planet-13th-babies-explained"&gt;several of its documentaries available on the platform&lt;/a&gt;, many of which seem to still be up, including &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krfcq5pF8u8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;13th&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCSo2hZRcXk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knock Down the House&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and episodes of nature docuseries &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmtXC_n6X6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our Planet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKa8EA"&gt;Netflix providing its original movies and shows for free on YouTube could be a way to introduce people to its content, especially since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;it no longer offers free trials for its service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCfKBi"&gt;If you’re interested in seeing the movie but don’t have Netflix, it’ll be available on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWOA1ZGywLbqmigxE4Qlvuw"&gt;Netflix’s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hM2ZmX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVb6EdKDBfU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to easily install the Android 12 developer preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d9HBAEQVKp6e725lbGLfEysg0bU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66886289/jbareham_181010_2989_0074.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlhtBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 18th, 2:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google released the first of its &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12 developer previews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so we’ve updated the info in this post to be relevant if you want to install it on your phone. The instructional photos might include a mention of Android 11, but we’ve ensured the steps are still accurate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEa7Ku"&gt;You can try out the Android 12 developer preview software right now if you have a Pixel 3 or later, but it’s understandable if the idea of flashing your device to install the OS is intimidating. It can be a tricky process, and the steps differ slightly depending on what phone you have and what kind of computer you’re going to use to download the software. But Google itself makes this process much more streamlined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6mztn"&gt;Google’s &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/download"&gt;Android Flash Tool&lt;/a&gt; is a web application that handles most of the steps of flashing for you. There are a few steps that you’ll need to do yourself before the new software can be installed, which we’ll walk you through below, but Google’s tool basically eliminates most of the hassle and complexity that makes it easy to mess up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnBR1D"&gt;There are a few important notes to make up here at the top. First, once you flash your phone with the developer preview, your device will get all future developer preview and beta updates over the air. In other words, you won’t need to flash your phone again when new builds of Android 12 are released. Just head to your system settings and fetch an update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58Olby"&gt;The second note is just your standard disclaimer that you do this at your own risk. This is unfinished software, and installing it could lead to malfunctions with your device or to software that you usually use. And depending on settings that you adjust in the Android Flash Tool, you might have to wipe all of the data from your phone. So proceed with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIGG-Z2OspcNqk1d8fR6JICl6vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19303885/vpavic_191018_3725_0231.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SPg2X6"&gt;Is my phone compatible with Android 12?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOSEp5"&gt;The Android 12 developer preview is compatible with the Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 3A, Pixel 3A XL, Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 4A, Pixel 4A 5G, and the Pixel 5. It’s possible that Google will broaden the list of devices supported by Android 12 in the upcoming beta, but for now, you’ll need one of those phones to get the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nWnG91"&gt;What browser do I need to use to flash my phone?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fwlb97"&gt;Google says that you can use any browser that supports the WebUSB API, which is supported by Chrome as well as Microsoft Edge version 79 and later. The Android Flash Tool works with all the major operating systems, including Linux, macOS, Chrome OS, and Windows 10, though browser compatibility may vary depending on your OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wxx6Rr"&gt;Step 1: Activate these three settings on your Android phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BMI7cK"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable the Developer Options menu&lt;/strong&gt; in your phone. First, open the Settings app. For phones running Android 8 (Oreo), click System. Otherwise, if your phone has Android 7 (Nougat) or later, scroll down to About Phone, then find Build Number. Tap Build Number seven times to enable Developer Options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dO4knj"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Turn on USB debugging&lt;/strong&gt; (this lets your phone and computer communicate via USB) within the Developer Options menu. To do this, head to Settings &amp;gt; System &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; Developer Options. You’ll find USB debugging with just a little scrolling down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ElHgpn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Enable OEM unlocking&lt;/strong&gt;. This option is also part of the Developer Options menu, further up the page than where you found USB debugging. If that option isn’t available for you to enable, that might be because it’s already enabled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/csscsUs89Ir1CKE5Rd299XIo9bU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16213698/vpavic_190503_3404_0019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HzryhV"&gt;Step 2: Connect your phone to your computer and get started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OSeB6k"&gt;If you use Windows 10, &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/run/win-usb"&gt;you’ll need to install this driver&lt;/a&gt; first for your phone to be recognized.  People using macOS or Linux don’t need a driver. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="weswdD"&gt;Connect your phone to your computer with a USB cable. Then &lt;a href="https://flash.android.com/preview/dp1"&gt;visit this page to proceed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NbuEfq"&gt;The Android Flash Tool will ask for permission to access ADB keys in a pop-up window, which is necessary to install software on your phone. You’ll need to tap “OK” to proceed with this process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android Flash Tool for Android 11" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R3SlZ5sAdLEg5Bm14ClFdb7XjIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014977/4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need to hit OK to proceed with the installation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WpBss1"&gt;Click “Select device.” Your device should appear in a pop-up window on your computer, so go ahead and click it. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ljh0M"&gt;Once you do that, you should now see a request on your phone that says “Allow USB debugging?” You’ll also see a long string of numbers and letters that should match up with what your PC shows if you click the gear icon on the Android Flash Tool page. On your phone, check the box next to “Always allow from this computer,” then tap Allow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jHjb7D"&gt;After that, your device should show up on the Android Flash Tool as being connected. Click on the box with the name of your device to proceed. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqEnVwEk_QE3UUVA0Z1kLBWYGvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014998/8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your device shows up as being connected, click into it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="sjTlzI"&gt;You’ll want to pay attention to what appears in the “Selected build” section of the Flash Tool (see below). It should say “Android 12 Developer Preview 1.” Before you hit the blue “Install” button at the bottom of the page, I recommend tapping the pencil icon next to “Selected build” and checking the “Lock Bootloader” box. This will lock the bootloader after this process is complete, leaving you with a more secure device than if it remained unlocked.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n4ejoA2xy7n9DiZCVdq1AtGd6ko=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20014994/6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Lock Bootloader” option, which will lock your bootloader after the software installation is complete.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="QyzbSn"&gt;The next window basically tells you to stop interacting with your phone during the rest of this process unless asked to do so and to not unplug your device. If you’re in a position to proceed, go ahead.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XRc70KHCAQGodzC1Gat0h2vS2PM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015001/1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure your data is backed up before you proceed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="XlJyBQ"&gt;One more prompt before getting started: a license agreement. You need to agree to the terms of the Android Software Development Kit License Agreement, which you can find &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/terms"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0FIfKs"&gt;After you hit “I accept,” your phone will reboot into its bootloader screen. If nothing happens for a few seconds, don’t worry. You may also see a window pop up on your computer that says “Reselect your device.” In that case, leave your phone alone and select “Reselect device” on the computer. According to Google, your phone might be renamed “Android,” though it might just be identified with the model name (e.g., Pixel 3).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Zdpkzo"&gt;If you haven’t flashed software before, Google will probably need to unlock your bootloader to proceed with the installation. Keep in mind that doing this will trigger a factory reset on your phone. If you haven’t backed up your data, you’ll lose everything. Once you agree, you’ll need to allow the bootloader to unlock on your phone. To do this, use the volume keys to navigate to the option that says “Unlock the bootloader,” then hit the power button once to confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0LiOV5"&gt;After that, the Android Flash Tool will begin to download and install the software. You can continue to watch along, but don’t touch your phone at this point, even though it will restart several times. Just keep an eye on the progress using the Android Flash Tool page on your computer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JAaw6d7-Vu3g4ted-MHrdzXS7bA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015017/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At this point, you can just sit and wait for the Android Flash Tool to wrap things up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wQDNXV"&gt;Once you’re all done, the phone will reboot one last time, and over on your PC, you’ll be met with a celebratory screen. You’re all done! And thankfully, you won’t have to go through this process again for the next Android 12 update — easy as this was. You’ll automatically receive updates to the developer preview over the air.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android flash tool" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WegRO7aOJMtF7tnpQvdwsPwvMN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20015030/10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re all done!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JwgANf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV offering HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz for $5 less in new entertainment bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NgodQrn6eVgT9Pnf24FZ3UgCD1w=/0x2:918x614/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838074/Screen_Shot_2021_02_18_at_12.43.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qCV1BW"&gt;For YouTube TV customers who subscribe individually to HBO Max, Showtime, and Starz, the company is rolling out a new entertainment bundle that will save people $5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XR290i"&gt;The optional package is $30 a month. Individually, &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeYoutubeTVOfferingEntertainmentBundleHBOMaxStarzShowtime02182021&amp;amp;source=verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; costs $15 a month, Showtime is $11 a month, and Starz is $9 a month, meaning customers who subscribe to all three spend $35 a month through the individual subscription plans. YouTube TV has steadily added more premium channels over the last couple of years, including inking a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145651/youtube-tv-hbo-streaming-max-cinemax-carriage-deal"&gt;deal with WarnerMedia for HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in February 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx2id6"&gt;While the bundle is an easy way to save $5 a month, YouTube has also gotten increasingly expensive over the last year. In June, YouTube TV increased its monthly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308449/youtube-tv-price-increase-64-99-viacom-hbo-new-channels"&gt;price from $50 to $65&lt;/a&gt;. The move came after YouTube signed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21249931/viacomcbs-youtubetv-nickelodeon-mtv-comedy-central-streaming"&gt;distribution agreement with ViacomCBS&lt;/a&gt; to carry a suite of channels: BET, CMT, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, Paramount Network, TV Land, and VH1. While YouTube TV isn’t the only virtual TV provider to increase monthly fees as more distribution deals are struck. (AT&amp;amp;T TV Now, Fubo TV, and Hulu with Live TV have all faced similar price hikes.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRwMpa"&gt;Still, for someone who relies on YouTube TV and wants access to three of the biggest premium cable networks, it’s nice to save $5 a month. Now if only YouTube TV could figure out its regional sports network issues.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas freeze risks slowing COVID-19 progress</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-WEATHER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MIY_vkk6WoRSejZ4YGnUHmwI0cs=/5x0:2995x1993/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68838072/1231221664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A warming center in Houston, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Thomas Shea / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1d9K9a"&gt;Power outages and freezing temperatures continue to throttle Texas. People without heat or safe water are heading to &lt;a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/16/texas-power-outage-help-warming-shelter/"&gt;warming centers&lt;/a&gt; or gathering in the homes of friends who have the lights on. The most pressing concern for many Texans right now is keeping warm, finding food, and making sure their water is safe to drink. But in the background is the ever-present threat of COVID-19 — which could spread in those indoor spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zn5bSY"&gt;COVID-19 cases in Texas are declining right now, like they are in most of the country, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/texas-coronavirus-cases.html"&gt;thousands of cases&lt;/a&gt; are still reported each day. Hospitalization rates are still high. The ongoing pandemic means that any other disaster, like the freeze, is layering on top of a baseline emergency. “It’s broadened everything into a compound disaster, where you have more than one problem happening at the same time,” says Kristina Dahl, a senior climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WU2u55"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hate to say it, but there will likely be a swell of COVID cases in Texas as people have been forced to abandon their homes, congregate together with friends and family outside their normal bubbles, all just to stay ALIVE in the cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;— Cedric Dark, MD, MPH, FACEP (@RealCedricDark) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RealCedricDark/status/1362135277276397573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hs6KFE"&gt;The freeze creates similar conditions to the COVID-19 risk posed by other weather-related disasters last year: hurricanes Laura and Delta. Both &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/lake-charles-hurricane-laura-delta.html"&gt;hit Louisiana&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of the Gulf Coast in a one-two punch at the end of the summer and forced thousands to leave their homes for safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3DFW2"&gt;Before those storms hit, Dahl worked on a study &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.07.20170555v1"&gt;modeling the potential impacts of a hypothetical hurricane evacuation&lt;/a&gt; on COVID-19 spread. That analysis predicted that type of movement &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; cause a spike in cases. It also found that social distancing and masks could limit the risk. “The same things that we’d been hearing throughout the pandemic could really help to limit that spread,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCEzFu"&gt;A clear hurricane-related surge in cases &lt;a href="https://weather.com/health/coronavirus/news/2020-10-14-hurricane-evacuations-covid-coronavirus-spike-laura-delta"&gt;never materialized&lt;/a&gt; in Louisiana after the hurricanes. There could be a few reasons for that, Dahl says. First, the state offered hotel vouchers to evacuees, which let them escape the storm’s path without crowding into multifamily shelters. COVID-19 cases were also high overall at that time, which makes it more difficult for epidemiologists to figure out where cases were coming from. (High case rates made it hard for researchers to figure out the impact of other potential COVID-19 clusters, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239408/capitol-riot-covid-cases-superspreader-arrests"&gt;January riots&lt;/a&gt; at the US Capitol.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="00SFaC"&gt;The Texas winter storm is a different sort of weather-related disaster than a hurricane, but Dahl says the warnings from the modeling study still apply. “The study that we did was hypothetical hurricane, but it could just have easily had been a wildfire, or an extreme cold snap, or any other sort of event that causes people to start moving around,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I1vFdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Figuring out if freeze contributes to major COVID-19 spread will be a challenge&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXi0Kl"&gt;Figuring out if the freezing weather contributes to major COVID-19 spread will be a challenge for the same reasons it was difficult to identify any spikes after the summer’s hurricanes. Cases are dropping around the country, but they’re still high, and it may be hard to see any kind of signal in the data. The storm also isn’t concentrated in one area, so direct impacts on case trends could be hard to see, Dahl says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4yO6rp"&gt;Like in Louisiana, though, additional COVID-19 cases aren’t preordained. If people wear masks and officials organize safe places for people to gather and get warm, it won’t be as easy for the virus to spread. “The same lessons apply around the need to keep transmission low, wherever people are going,” Dahl says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oG2uZO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
