    <title>Facebook launches its Collab music app to the public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Facebook Collab logo next to a smartphone showing a screenshot of the Collab interface." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gqPy438PDczMoiCXhZ8HY3T43qk=/0x15:768x527/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512379/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_10.00.57_AM_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaB9TH"&gt;Facebook has publicly launched Collab, an experimental music-making app that first launched as an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21270640/facebook-collab-npe-invite-only-beta-release-music-making-app"&gt;invite-only beta&lt;/a&gt; back in May, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/facebook-publicly-launches-its-collaborative-music-video-app-collab/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jTqAn"&gt;The app allows users to create short-form music videos by combining up to three independent videos. So, for example, three musicians could each play a different part of a song and combine them into one video. But each video that’s created is also posted to a public “Collab” feed, where people can view and play along with it if they choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FeEiI"&gt;So you could also record one part, then mix it with two other parts you find on the Collab feed that other people have recorded. Or you can just mix other people’s videos together — you don’t need to be a musician yourself. (Every user is properly credited for their contributions, according to Facebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLWkdJ"&gt;You won’t have to worry about lining all the videos up — Collab includes in-app tools to sync the parts together. Per its App Store page, “We make sure that as you swipe, the videos play at exactly the right moment to be in sync.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nD70JX"&gt;The app isn’t directly integrated with Facebook (yet, at least), but you can export the finished products to your Instagram story (as well as other platforms, including TikTok) via iOS share sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOLd38"&gt;Collab is free on the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/collab-band-together/id1507800473"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, and you can download it today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bxwQp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woEYCQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9 leak shows off the upcoming 2021 flagship in photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus 9" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUM02R_Z9tORzE39Ylx8ymVTIk=/0x1:1874x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512324/oneplus_9_leaked.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images of a prototype device confirm some previously leaked spec. | Photo: PhoneArena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vov8Sx"&gt;The OnePlus 9 likely won’t arrive until spring 2021, but thanks to some &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-9-5g-hands-on-specs-leak-exclusive_id129026"&gt;photos published by &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;we won’t have to wait that long for a glimpse of it. The images are of an alleged prototype device complete with unique pre-prod branding, and some software screengrabs reveal a little extra detail about the upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zG6KWK"&gt;First up: the screen. It looks like OnePlus will stick with the flat screen format it used in the OnePlus 8 and 8T – the 9 has a flat 6.55-inch display with a hole punch camera in the upper left corner. The OnePlus 8 Pro’s screen features a design that curves around the edges of the phone, which we found lead to more accidental touches than occurred with the flat version. &lt;em&gt;PhoneArena &lt;/em&gt;reports that the 9’s screen is a 2400 x 1080 panel with 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jFYLMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"OnePlus 8 review: familiar formula","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219278/oneplus-8-review-specs-features-camera-battery-screen-price-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8 Pro review: big league","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219861/oneplus-8-pro-review-specs-features-price-camera-battery-photos-video"},{"title":"OnePlus 8T review: the numbers game","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514174/oneplus-8t-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CDjerY"&gt;The pre-prod device also looks to include a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888 processor&lt;/a&gt;, the chipset of choice for 2021 flagship phones. And that leads into another previously leaked OnePlus 9 feature: 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbvvAx"&gt;As for imaging hardware, the images show a camera bump pushed to the upper left corner of the device’s rear. There’s also new “Ultrashot” branding on the bump not seen on previous models, though it may or may not remain on the final device. The specs gleaned from this early look don’t give away exact details about camera sensor resolution or focal length, but it seems likely that two of the rear cameras seen in these photos will be standard wide and ultrawide modules. The third could be a macro or depth-sensing camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;A look at the SIM card slot and USB-C port on the upcoming OnePlus phone.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lL48kO"&gt;Other details include a 4500 mAh battery, Android 11 with Oxygen OS, and a version with 128GB storage and 8GB RAM (there will likely be an option with a different memory configuration). There’s no confirmed launch date for the OnePlus 9, but the company’s schedule for past releases — and the timing of this leak — mean early spring 2021 looks likely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jon Porter?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH1JQEHPiR5CdIdiAeow4cz8DDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512316/jporter_201208_4323_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fitting a lot of tech into a small space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gBdQ3J"&gt;Working from home has its advantages, but one of the problems that many people have to face is trying to find enough space in a crowded environment. Jon Porter, who is the London-based news reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has had to be especially resourceful in putting together a place where he could report, write, and review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1FcUQ"&gt;We talked to Jon to find out how he’s managed to do such great reporting out of a small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2qSlJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdG2ny"&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s UK-based news reporter. I’ve lived in London basically my entire life, and I’ve been with the site for a little over two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwWlGG"&gt;Day-to-day, I’m responsible for covering any tech news that breaks during UK hours before the US wakes up. But once the East Coast is awake, I can get down to business &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36QUbG5nPDk&amp;amp;t=97s"&gt;reviewing phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c8UdKX6GBA"&gt;building keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;complaining about the iPhone’s lack of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXAFp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEmUES"&gt;That’s putting it lightly. I share my flat in London with three other people, so a corner of my bedroom is about as much space as I can spare for a home office. I honestly don’t think I’d manage it if I hadn’t lucked out and found this desk being given away for free on the weekend I moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_vvFBYtuLs0xpj0G4wkSU1Vfq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158036/jporter_201208_4323_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kwYkh6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMPZ9y"&gt;When we moved in, the flat was completely unfurnished, and we spent the first few months frantically scouring through services like &lt;a href="https://www.freecycle.org"&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; for any furniture people were giving away. Long story short, we met some people who were leaving the country and had a flat full of stuff to get rid of, so we rented a van and carted it all home. The van broke down en-route (don’t ask), but most of the furniture has served us well ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9UwEu"&gt;All of which is to say that I have absolutely no idea where the desk is from, who made it, or how much it would cost to buy new. But it’s very good at packing in a lot of stuff. There’s a little shelf under the monitor where I have a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-4-pro-black-1tb%2F10134659.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an Arcam irDAC stashed, and the keyboard tray lets me keep the desk surface itself clear-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ShiGy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a wrist rest you have in front of your keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM3U28"&gt;Absolutely! I love mechanical keyboards, but their keys are so tall compared to laptop-style keys that I find I need a rest to keep my wrists at a comfortable angle. I know you’re technically supposed to keep your hands raised while you type, but honestly that’s just so exhausting on my arms that I’ve never been able to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDuWdk"&gt;The keyboard itself is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87M-EB2/dp/B004WOF7QM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b7e79c45caf9815118023c76fc3a2e2a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Filco Majestouch 2 Tenkeyless with Cherry MX Brown&lt;/a&gt; switches. I firmly believe that Filco makes the keyboards that feel the best to type on, and they’re what I’d recommend to anyone looking for a keyboard. The only problem is that the lettering on their keycaps can wear out a little quickly, so I swapped out the stock caps for a set manufactured by GMK. Oh, and I also installed a programmable keyboard controller in there so I could add some keyboard shortcuts for turning the volume up and down and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxHK7zIUKVyNvUU7G3O5F3-PyUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158042/jporter_201208_4323_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wArvXR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like you’ve got a classy desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0J1M5"&gt;This Herman Miller Aeron was the main investment I made this year after I’d been working from home full time for a few months. I bought it after I got tired of having to sit with a pillow supporting my lower back to stop it from hurting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCFDdM"&gt;In normal times I probably would have actually gone into a store and tried out a bunch of chairs in person, but unfortunately that wasn’t really possible. Instead I played it safe, and bought the chair that always seems to come up whenever people online talk about the best office chairs. I got my Aeron secondhand off eBay from a company that was clearly selling leftovers from office clearouts, but it’s treated me well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjMlQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0WqRz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jWYqV"&gt;Alrighty! It’s a bit of a work-in-progress at the moment while I wait for AMD’s new CPUs and Nvidia’s new graphics cards to come down in price, but for the time being I’m running an &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17877968/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-review-benchmarks-performance-features"&gt;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; and 16GB of RAM. That’s all packed into a &lt;a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=522&amp;amp;area=en"&gt;Silverstone FT05 case&lt;/a&gt; which, much like my keyboard, I like because it’s incredibly understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iATjCQ"&gt;One day I want to upgrade that GPU to an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726553874957965631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, slap a &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-5600x"&gt;Ryzen 5600X&lt;/a&gt; in there, and downsize the whole machine into a small form-factor case, but who knows when that’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVhCx9sSAagAn8noTcUN1wDNul8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158038/jporter_201208_4323_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZaMdR4s9AbPw39CWImLx9mU14Aw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158040/jporter_201208_4323_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hefi-igiQlWja18O51fvV1JPIXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158035/jporter_201208_4323_0021.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HrpsS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got an interesting arrangement of displays. You’ve got one hanging off the wall, and the other is, well, impressively big. How did you come up with this arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqI7r"&gt;I have to confess this isn’t how I’d have things set up if I had the choice. My main monitor is an &lt;a href="https://agon.aocmonitorap.com/au/product_ag352UCG.php"&gt;AOC AG352UCG 1440p ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; which would normally be out of my price range, but I got a deal on it because it’s a little… well… broken. Its DisplayPort works perfectly, and it supports G-Sync to keep games running smoothly, but unfortunately the HDMI port seems to be busted, so I can’t use it with the PS4 Pro I’ve got sitting underneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiFoZu"&gt;That’s why I have the second monitor sitting in landscape orientation to the left of it, for the PlayStation. Otherwise I’d have it in portrait and use it to read Twitter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlm3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN25ln"&gt;From left to right there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d9858b9243b3e5ec844044ebc69beb4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball microphone&lt;/a&gt;, which does exactly what I need it to and means I can get away with wearing normal headphones on calls. Then we’ve got my &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726554111787728059" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Z200 speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which were just the cheapest I could find. They’re fine, but whenever I’m listening to something that matters I’m using headphones or streaming to an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-00464617%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22165831%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jon-porter-nvidia-ps4-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea Symfonisk Sonos speaker lamp&lt;/a&gt; I have on the other side of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6y9Df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10227163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzfHjp"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXNV58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=fa544d7577613f1571bfde2ea745914c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; stand on my desk for when my phone needs extra juice during the day, which rarely happens now that I’m at home all the time but it’s nice to know it’s there. The PS4 Pro sitting to the right of it needs no introduction. That little bar sitting on top of it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-W010-Wireless-Sensor-DolphinBar/dp/B00HZWEB74/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=75a36df2d93c99d0fded1ce39e3c96ff&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mayflash W010 USB sensor bar&lt;/a&gt;, like the Nintendo Wii console used to have. I bought one for my PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games, and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoybT3"&gt;Next up is the Arcam irDAC which handles audio for both the PS4 and my PC, and those accessories on top of it are an Anker SD card reader and a pair of Samsung’s Galaxy Beans, ahem sorry, Galaxy Buds Live. There’s a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flogitech-c920%2Fp%2FN82E16826104635&amp;amp;u1=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 webcam&lt;/a&gt; on top of my monitor with a privacy shutter, and I have a bunch of USB cables hanging off of what’s supposed to be a headphone hook to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9v8i2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxbRJ"&gt;Phew, that sounds like a lot! But remember that I live in a flatshare, so I basically have one room that all my tech lives in. One day all this stuff will spread out when I have the space for it, but for now it’s all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZv_Aun3vNC1Ea3nH3824TetVSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158041/jporter_201208_4323_0011.0.jpg"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5iSzhzRpOtl2LBQUs14HHwUM60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158033/jporter_201208_4323_0024.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yR7QFz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a relatively clean desk — is that how you like to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jp037d"&gt;In my ideal world, this would be how tidy I keep it all of the time. But the reality is that when review season hits and the devices start rolling in, I quickly end up with piles of phones, headphones, coffee cups, and whatever else on my desk. Thankfully we’re in a bit of a quieter period at the moment so I can keep things a little more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeQdT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see there’s a notebook front and center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgPGD"&gt;It’s the only way I can stay organized. I know there are lots of good to-do list apps out there, but for me nothing beats keeping track of work using a physical notepad. Every day I force myself to write out what needs to be done, and the manual process helps me to remember each task. I also just find it much more convenient to quickly note down something on a physical pad while I’m on the phone, rather than trying to do everything from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSr9zz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a pint glass I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBwJ7H"&gt;Gotta keep hydrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXi6DJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your guitar. Do you keep it nearby for occasional breaks, or is that just a handy place to store it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YULd6c"&gt;Oh, it’s totally just a musical fidget spinner. Whenever I’m stuck, I pick up the guitar, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fender-Player-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar/dp/B07CTYNK7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ccf904b38de122cfc30f90e8f67d7bbf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mexican-made Fender Stratocaster&lt;/a&gt;, and play a couple of chords while I think. I also used to play a lot while I waited for things to load, but SSDs put an end to that. I must have had it for 15 years or so, and although I rarely get around to playing seriously anymore, I could never bring myself to part with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKNo8C"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yFIezv"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>The Office is leaving Netflix, but its first two seasons will be free on Peacock</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h_ZnadpbdVnW9ScOZxuX8Xb3sTE=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512209/theofficepeacock.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peacock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ETVF"&gt;The end of an era is approaching: &lt;em&gt;The Office &lt;/em&gt;will leave&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Netflix on January 1st and exclusively move over to Peacock, NBCUniversal’s streaming service. Peacock confirmed the January 1st launch date today and explained how viewers can watch all 201 episodes of the show. The first two seasons will be available for free, but seasons 3 through 9 will require a paid subscription. Viewers can either pay $4.99 per month with ads or $9.99 monthly without ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbKASM"&gt;Peacock’s building out an entire experience around the show, which will likely be an important one for the service and potentially encourage many more people to subscribe. Subscribers can view extra material, like behind-the-scenes footage, bloopers, and interviews as well as curated collections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuYrKg"&gt;The loss is a big one for Netflix, although the company knew the date was coming. The show’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;widely considered one of its most popular with more than 52 billion minutes watched in 2018, some 3 percent of all Netflix minutes watched in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/netflix-battles-rivals-for-its-most-watched-shows-friends-and-the-office-11556120136"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pweoFa"&gt;As Netflix loses more of these comfort watches, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035338/friends-netflix-leaving-january-2020-hbo-max-may-streaming-seinfeld-the-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;, it’ll have to rely on its in-house content to maintain its subscriber base, while also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;charging more&lt;/a&gt; so it can keep making shows. It’s already cranking out content routinely, which gave it a major advantage in 2020 when most video shoots were sidelined because of the COVID-19 pandemic. But now, Netflix is entering the new year with the loss of one major show and a backlog of content to shoot and prepare for the service. It might have a rough year or two ahead, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229587/netflix-earnings-coronavirus-pandemic-streaming-entertainment"&gt;depending on when shooting resumes&lt;/a&gt; and how well its competitors are able to produce their content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxEC2d"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite gets a performance mode so it runs better on older PCs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYMbsSwitObdg8xetnfpl5BR7t0=/195x0:2991x1864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512110/Fortnite_20201202100316.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pPaxdr"&gt;It’s no mean feat that &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; manages to run as well as it does on just about any conceivable platform — from mobile to Switch to high-end gaming PC. Today, in a post on its blog, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-performance-mode-boosts-pc-fps"&gt;announced a feature called performance mode&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow older PCs to run the game better. It’ll be available on December 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d3hEa"&gt;The new mode “offers significant performance gains by trading out visual quality to lower memory usage and lighten the load on CPU and GPU,” the company writes, meaning the game will look less good so it doesn’t torch your hardware. (Users running &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on older hardware will see a prompt about the mode when they boot up the game.) Epic also bundled in a feature that allows players to remove high-resolution textures from the game’s install, which should save a &lt;em&gt;significant&lt;/em&gt; amount of hard drive space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvRJvX"&gt;Epics claims users running the new mode will see a huge boost in frame rates on older machines, as compared to the previous low-performance settings. You’ll be able to use performance mode in both Battle Royale and Creative.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uneb5SuNrpBJmT2Aq06zhRF6t28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22169959/Screen_Shot_2020_12_14_at_3.28.27_PM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FPS gains in performance mode on representative hardware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yIaStG"&gt;This is all to say it might finally be possible to run &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in 720p at 60 frames per second, even on that old gaming laptop you still have lying around. Don’t get rid of it! That’s your backup &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; box now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds Live Translation to Alexa’s toolbox of skills</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tIdPVHJPu3u3xI-gjFAJw7niKg8=/53x0:1199x764/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512080/AlexaLiveTranslation.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KF8AsU"&gt;Alexa is gaining the ability to do live translations between English and Spanish, German, French, Hindi, Italian, and Brazilian Portuguese with &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;a new update Amazon announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The update joins Alexa’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22088394/amazon-alexa-multilingual-support-italian-german-french-shopping-fire-tv"&gt;expanded multilingual skills&lt;/a&gt; that were added in November to make the assistant a more capable non-English speaker and translator on devices in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhsDbp"&gt;Live Translation can be initiated with a voice command like “Alexa, translate Spanish.” Alexa will play a beep to signal that you can start speaking with your partner and then translate your conversations live, even displaying a live transcript on the screen of Echo Show devices. Amazon sees this as being useful for talking with visiting friends and family from abroad or in a hotel setting through the Alexa for Hospitality platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqxOCy"&gt;In support of the new skill, Amazon also says it modified Alexa &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazon-launches-a-live-translation-feature-for-echo-devices/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29"&gt;to better handle natural pauses in conversations&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to changes to Alexa’s tolerance for end-of-sentence breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DRA371"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Assistant’s interpreter mode translates 27 languages|62134" data-volume-uuid="ee25af6cb" data-volume-id="62134" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-689" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AVk40V"&gt;While we haven’t been able to give Alexa’s Live Translation a thorough test, the skill sounds very similar to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9234753?hl=en"&gt;Google Assistant’s Interpreter Mode&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18170806/google-assistant-translate-languages-real-time-interpreter-ces-2019"&gt;originally announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Our first demo of Interpreter Mode was admittedly rough, but at launch, Google attempted to handle 27 different languages, far more than Alexa currently supports, along with offering a similar ability to display a live transcript on devices like the Nest Hub. Whether Alexa is able to be more accurate and eventually support more languages seems to be where Live Translation can differ the most from Google’s offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9R1yYQ"&gt;Amazon says Alexa Live Translation is available now on Echo devices in the US. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft roll out new benefits for California drivers under Prop 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kDrScGmw8D2-pTNDxBxGu_uia9s=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512026/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJhZXn"&gt;Following their victory last month in California on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;Prop 22 ballot measure&lt;/a&gt;, Uber and Lyft have unveiled the new “benefits” for California drivers on their platforms, including guaranteed minimum earnings and stipends for health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVb1kR"&gt;“Even though we’ve won the vote, we’re still not done,” Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a blog post announcing the benefits&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;In fact, we’ve only just begun to improve independent work together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9e0bqV"&gt;Gig economy companies, including Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;spent more than $200 million&lt;/a&gt; on the “Yes on 22” campaign. Prop 22 exempts them from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/2/20841070/uber-lyft-ab5-california-bill-drivers-labor"&gt;AB5, a California state law&lt;/a&gt; requiring them to treat their workers as employees. The companies said AB5 would increase wait times and prices for customers, while taking flexibility away from drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8pKBxg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prop 22 allows the companies to continue categorizing drivers as independent contractors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DYLwGu"&gt;Prop 22 allows the companies to continue categorizing drivers as independent contractors and also provide some additional benefits. Opponents argued that the provisions in Prop 22 were not equal to the economic security of full-time employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxrCGZ"&gt;Under Prop 22, gig workers — including ride-share drivers — will be paid 120 percent of California’s minimum wage of $13 per hour, which increases to $14 per hour in 2021. For ride-share drivers, this applies only during active hours: when they have a passenger in their vehicle or are en route to pick up a passenger. It requires workers with 15 active hours a week to receive a health care stipend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjd6kq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fblog%2Fcalifornia%2Fp22-independent-work%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174600%2Fuber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber’s benefits program&lt;/a&gt; calls for drivers to be paid at least 20 percent more than the pickup city’s minimum wage plus 30 cents per mile for expenses. That 30 cents per mile doesn’t apply to delivery workers on foot or bicycle. Drivers who earn less than the guaranteed minimum over a two-week period will be paid the difference automatically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flBT7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Fhub%2Fposts%2Fprop-22-passes&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F22174600%2Fuber-lyft-new-benefits-california-drivers-prop-22-gig-economy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lyft’s pay schedule is similar&lt;/a&gt;, with its first guaranteed earnings period beginning on December 16th. At both companies, drivers who earn more than the guaranteed minimum will keep all of their earnings — there is no upper limit. They’ll also keep 100 percent of their tips&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1iwem"&gt;For health care, Lyft will provide a quarterly health care subsidy for drivers who drive an average of at least 15 hours per week. To qualify, drivers have to provide proof they are enrolled in a qualifying health care plan. Uber’s health care stipend also requires an average of 15 hours per week, and drivers have to prove they are the primary policyholder on a qualifying health insurance plan. Uber drivers receive 50 percent of the stipend — amount still TBD — if they average 15 active hours a week and 100 percent of the stipend when they average 25 active hours per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rrDqU"&gt;Drivers can qualify for the health care subsidies beginning on January 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bk7t9Y"&gt;To cover the costs of the new benefits, Uber said it would apply a fee of up to $1.50 to the cost of rides and up to $2 on meal deliveries, the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/166601bd-584c-41f8-b1d2-b46afd0c9782"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft did not provide details on any additional customer fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWtOH5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_22,_App-Based_Drivers_as_Contractors_and_Labor_Policies_Initiative_(2020)"&gt;Prop 22 mandates&lt;/a&gt; current ride-share drivers receive safety training before July 1st, 2021. Drivers who sign on after January 1st will be required to complete the safety course before they take their first trips. Drivers will also be required to take breaks of at least six hours if they drive more than 12 hours in a 24-hour period, and they will be enrolled in injury protection insurance that covers medical expenses, disability payments, and survivor benefits. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InCAUP"&gt;On Monday, electronic voting system company Smartmatic demanded three conservative media outlets to retract claims that its machines skewed votes in favor of President-elect Joe Biden in November’s US presidential election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W9JVpu"&gt;Smartmatic issued &lt;a href="https://www.smartmatic.com/us/media/article/smartmatic-demands-justice-for-defamation/"&gt;retraction demand letters&lt;/a&gt; to&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News Network, according to a press release published by the Florida-based company Monday. In the letters, Smartmatic identifies several “factually inaccurate statements” made by the three conservative outlets throughout the 2020 presidential election cycle. These demands are often a precursor to a defamation lawsuit, although it is unclear whether Smartmatic will pursue litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vb0nK9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jeqp1J"&gt;“They have no evidence to support their attacks on Smartmatic because there is no evidence. This campaign was designed to defame Smartmatic and undermine legitimately conducted elections,” Antonio Mugica, Smartmatic CEO, said in a statement Monday. “This campaign is an attack on election systems and election workers in an effort to depress confidence in future elections and potentially counter the will of the voters, not just here, but in democracies around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ErxY8"&gt;Over the last few weeks, Smartmatic and Dominion Voting Systems have been targeted by conspiracy theorists who allege that the companies manipulated votes in favor of Biden. Conspiracy theorists have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-dominion/fact-check-dominion-is-not-linked-to-smartmatic-antifa-or-venezuela-did-not-switch-u-s-2020-election-votes-in-virginia-and-was-not-subject-to-a-u-s-army-raid-in-germany-idUSKBN2861TB"&gt;falsely alleged&lt;/a&gt; that the voting companies have ties to antifa and Venezuela.         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08TFG3"&gt;These conspiracy theories have traveled from the internet to state legislatures. Last week, Dominion Voting Systems called the allegations “defamatory,” saying company representatives would be made available &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/12/10/dominion-voting-systems-election-fraud-michigan-senate/3876804001/"&gt;to testify before the Michigan&lt;/a&gt; State Senate this week. Representatives had previously threatened to subpoena the voting company to testify as a result of these false election claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rb7Kyn"&gt;Last month, the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21563274/dhs-cisa-no-evidence-us-voting-compromised"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; confirming that the November 3rd election was the “most secure in American history” and “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Na9GXx"&gt;President Donald Trump has made baseless claims of voting fraud over the last few weeks. Shortly after CISA put out its statement debunking election fraud last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;Trump fired CISA director Chris Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. Last week, Krebs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/08/944270554/former-cyber-security-chief-sues-trump-campaign-and-others-charging-defamation"&gt;filed defamation suits&lt;/a&gt; against the Trump campaign and Newsmax.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pajamas Suit lets you pretend you’re dressing up for a Zoom meeting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a man wearing the Aoki pajamas suit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QswnIrBd9M4gnrzTLoOnxjxhQvA=/0x0:1300x867/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511869/A28_20WHWMJK1_c00_a020_pl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Aoki&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QP9i5D"&gt;If you’ve been showing up to work Zoom meetings in your pajamas and feel kind of weird about it, Japanese clothing retailer &lt;a href="https://www.aoki-style.com/shop/item/A28_20WHWMJK1?shopCode=AO-MENS"&gt;Aoki has a solution for you&lt;/a&gt;: a piece of clothing that looks like a classic suit jacket but &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; like PJs. It’s calling it the Pajamas Suit, and it really does look like a suit jacket — complete with the cut and the buttons on both the sleeves and the front. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcdZzX"&gt;This shirt, and others like it that aim to make you look more presentable in video calls, are uniquely suited (ha!) for 2020 when a lot of meetings have been happening remotely. While the standards for what counts as acceptable workwear &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/lead/casual-dress-in-workplace"&gt;have become more relaxed&lt;/a&gt; over the last decade or so, I think we’ve all shown up to Zoom calls in something we would &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear at the office. (I just did my last meeting in a T-shirt I’ve had since high school.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SCcMiy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Japanese suit retailer Aoki is selling a “pajama suit,” a set of pajamas that look like a suit, perfect for work from home. &lt;a href="https://t.co/POZwBOpV7F"&gt;https://t.co/POZwBOpV7F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gearoid Reidy (@GearoidReidy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GearoidReidy/status/1338432287789043712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NnfXjF"&gt;While I like to think that clothing standards don’t affect me, and the idea of suits being the be all, end all of office attire is a little classist and a lot sexist, it still feels a bit weird to dress for work the same way I’d dress to go on a jog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcLwRX"&gt;That’s not to say I’m about to drop around $50 (4,990 yen) on the Pajamas Suit, though. Not that it doesn’t look great, because I think it does, but you still need to wear a T-shirt under it, and the available colors just don’t work with my current wardrobe. Oh, and it also seems like Aoki only ships to Japan, which makes sense since it’s a massive retailer in the country but doesn’t seem to have much of a presence outside of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fSioP2"&gt;Thankfully, there’s an option for Americans: cardigans, which are essentially what the Pajamas Suit is. If you also want to attend your next Zoom meeting in comfort and style, you can probably find what you need in your local thrift shop. (Macklemore really &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; ahead of his time.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is investigating data collection at YouTube, Facebook, and seven other companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VyPNBeJ6vZXDaU_MzhAPfofjmw8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68511777/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tjpNkX"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission announced Monday that it is launching a new inquiry into the privacy practices of some of the largest tech companies and social media platforms in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNNlYt"&gt;In a press release published Monday, the FTC announced that it is ordering nine social media and video streaming companies — including Amazon, TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, Discord, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitter, WhatsApp, and YouTube — to provide data on how they collect and use personal information provided by their users. The companies have 45 days to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i8VQx"&gt;Each of the nine companies was contacted for comment but did not immediately respond to requests from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gq6Xm"&gt;The FTC’s orders were authorized as part of a wide-ranging investigative inquiry and do not serve specific law enforcement purposes. However, the FTC could pursue enforcement actions should it find wrongful behavior throughout the study. In the agency’s Monday orders, the FTC requested that the companies provide information related to how they collect personal data, how that data determines which ads and content users are shown, and whether they “apply algorithms or data analytics to personal information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nul7Hu"&gt;The commission voted 4-1 to approve the orders with Commissioner Noah Phillips dissenting, saying that the probe was too wide-ranging to produce useful results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVKhwl"&gt;“These digital products may have launched with the simple goal of connecting people or fostering creativity. But, in the decades since, the industry model has shifted from supporting users’ activities to monetizing them,” three FTC commissioners who voted to approve the orders said in a joint statement Monday. “This transition has been fueled by the industry’s increasing intrusion into our private lives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFJ99B"&gt;In February, the FTC used &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/2020/2/11/21133268/facebook-microsoft-apple-amazon-google-antitrust-review-joe-simons"&gt;this same investigative authority&lt;/a&gt; to request information on past acquisitions made by big tech companies, including Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft. Last week, the FTC sued Facebook to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unwind its acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; of Instagram and WhatsApp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EyT8Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUc8lF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
