    <title>Waymo starts offering autonomous rides in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRS4NJ-BRBkyOOn4NFgJw0ZeLII=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768955/vpavic_4412_20210111_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d3zLpt"&gt;Waymo is going to start shuttling a wider group of passengers around in its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, California — though they’ll have to sign nondisclosure agreements, and there still will be a human safety driver behind the wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsK9QZ"&gt;It’s the second city where the company has expanded its nascent autonomous vehicle offering, as the Google sibling has been performing fully driverless rides rides without a safety driver in parts of Phoenix, Arizona for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;more than a year now&lt;/a&gt;. Waymo is one of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;handful of companies&lt;/a&gt; trying to get a commercial service off the ground built around autonomous vehicles, like Argo AI (which is backed by Ford and Volkswagen) and Cruise (which is backed by General Motors). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjBIsn"&gt;Waymo has been testing self-driving cars in San Francisco for a decade, dating back to when it was still just a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/5/14/5716468/i-took-a-ride-in-a-self-driving-car"&gt;quirky-looking project&lt;/a&gt; inside Google. And it has let some Waymo employees ride in the early version of the commercial AV program in San Francisco. But now people can apply through the Waymo One smartphone app to take part in what it’s calling the “Trusted Tester” program, which is basically a rebranding of the “Early Rider” program it ran in Phoenix. (Waymo says the Early Rider program in Phoenix will also take on the new name.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H5l9eE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Free rides in exchange for feedback and a tight lip&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IHUK0N"&gt;People who are accepted into the program will be able to take rides in Waymo’s autonomous Jaguar I-Pace SUVs for free but will have to offer feedback in exchange, and they won’t be able to publicly share what the experience is like. There will be vehicles that are wheelchair-accessible, too. This is how the company started out the service in Phoenix, though now anyone can hop into one of its vehicles there and even film and share the experience — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436584/waymo-driverless-stuck-traffic-roadside-assistance-video"&gt;warts and all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf1liM"&gt;“From using the Waymo One app, to pickup and drop-offs, to the ride itself, we receive valuable feedback from our riders that allows us to refine our product offering as we advance our service” in San Francisco, the company wrote in a blog post. “We kicked off this program last week with a select few and are now expanding the program to all interested San Franciscans. We’ll begin with an initial group and welcome more riders in the weeks to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGdgE"&gt;Waymo has some 300 vehicles in Phoenix, some of which operate without a safety driver. The company declined to say how many vehicles will be running as part of this new program in San Francisco, or how many people it will accept into the program, or when it will start testing fully driverless vehicles in the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmKeU2"&gt;But expanding this program to a second city is a big step. Phoenix has always offered wide roads and steady, warm weather. Those conditions will be harder to come by in San Francisco, a city that is famous for a zig-zagging road, and one where the fog is so notorious &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KarlTheFog"&gt;it has its own Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPhR7f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton’s recalled, redesigned Tread goes on sale in the US on August 30th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Peloton Tread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01YHN68kQAe9sFjyyD9ZW_CusVA=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768810/2020.07.15_PRISMLAUNCH_DOUBLE_HANDOFF_3QUARTER_2500.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton Tread | Image: Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZOzd2L"&gt;In May, after a series of accidents linked to multiple injuries and one death, Peloton announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;recalls&lt;/a&gt; for its Tread Plus treadmill and a redesigned version of the Peloton Tread. The more serious incidents involved the Tread Plus, which remains on the shelf. However, the new Tread has since received tweaks to keep the screen from loosening and falling off. Now &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-tread-availability"&gt;Peloton says the $2,495 Tread will go on sale&lt;/a&gt; across the US, Canada, and the UK starting on August 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P10zzv"&gt;Unlike the 32-inch screen on the treadmill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;we reviewed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/tread"&gt;cheaper Tread&lt;/a&gt; has a 23.8-inch HD touchscreen with built-in speakers so you can interact with your trainer during a workout and track progress when you’re done. It also has a smaller footprint at 68 inches by 33 inches wide and a traditional belt instead of its predecessor’s slatted design.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Peloton Tread" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zjWpEpX33KhcWAkiNooCRnQrS7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22802610/2020.07.15_PRISMLAUNCH_RENDER_OTS_3QUARTERS_0072_1500.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peloton&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peloton Tread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VZ1cnD"&gt;The Tread recall offered repairs for the 1,050 units that shipped during its limited availability earlier this year, and the new units will ship with the problems already addressed. Peloton also called out its safety features, including the Tread Lock passcode needed to unlock the belt before each workout, safety key, and buttons placed in easy to reach locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcWHLd"&gt;These days &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609744/peloton-update-tread-plus-treadmill-lock-subscription"&gt;you don’t need a Peloton subscription to access the Tread Lock feature&lt;/a&gt;, but given the company’s business model, the &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/membership"&gt;$39 per month All-Access membership&lt;/a&gt; is a recommended add-on. The new Tread will also launch in Germany for €2,495, and three new German running instructors will be available after it arrives in that market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnlyFans CEO on why it banned adult content: ‘the short answer is banks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8GjgB3NljrJ5lgJjgl74irf-Ek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768584/acastro_200227_1777_onlyfans_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vohdfJ"&gt;OnlyFans founder and CEO Tim Stokely says banks were behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634785/onlyfans-new-terms-of-service-policy-banning-sex-masturbation"&gt;the online fundraising platform’s recent ban&lt;/a&gt; on sexually explicit content. “The change in policy, we had no choice — the short answer is banks,” Stokely &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7b8ce71c-a87a-440e-9f3d-58069ca0480b"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview published today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wsinH"&gt;Stokely named three major banks that refused service because of “reputational risk” associated with the UK-based OnlyFans’ sexual material: Bank of New York Mellon, Metro Bank, an JPMorgan Chase. He said BNY Mellon specifically had “flagged and rejected” every wire transaction involving OnlyFans, threatening its ability to pay creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vIjqHL"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-19/onlyfans-to-block-sexually-explicit-videos-starting-in-october?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; more generally that “banking partners and payment providers” had pressured OnlyFans — a platform previously known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638310/onlyfans-ban-explicit-content-payment-processing-visa"&gt;a haven for sex workers&lt;/a&gt; — into banning the promotion of sexually explicit material starting October 1st. The ban will affect anything that “shows, promotes, advertises, or refers to” real or simulated sex, masturbation, and sex-related bodily fluids. It will still allow nudity, but an email to OnlyFans creators suggested that things like zooming too close to body parts could violate the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VyvLhg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The ban starts October 1st&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gzKQMm"&gt;Payment processors like MasterCard and Visa are well-known bottlenecks in the digital economy. They’ve recently &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/business/visa-mastercard-block-pornhub.html"&gt;clamped down&lt;/a&gt; on the use of their cards to pay for sexual content, ostensibly to cut off platforms that allow child sexual abuse material and nonconsensual pornography — although the crackdown follows pressure from organizations that broadly oppose sex work and pornography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Ht4gD"&gt;Stokely’s comments, however, single out banks as the primary drivers behind the ban. He claims that JPMorgan Chase, for instance, is “particularly aggressive in closing accounts of sex workers” or any business that supports them. Similarly, he said that Metro Bank had closed OnlyFans’ account on short notice in 2019. Stokely told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; that he was not disclosing the company’s current banking partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Swtzot"&gt;OnlyFans is the latest of several web companies to purge or limit sexual content in recent years — following platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126451/tumblr-porn-social-media-ban"&gt;Tumblr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/vbqwwj/patreon-suspension-of-adult-content-creators"&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535109/ebay-sex-ban-adult-only-queer-collectors"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to payment-related pressures, companies serving sex workers face heightened legal risk after the 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/11/17223720/trump-signs-fosta-sesta-sex-trafficking-section-230-law"&gt;passage of FOSTA-SESTA&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple and Google’s app stores restrict sexually explicit material. The day of OnlyFans’ sex crackdown, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/onlyfans-investors-struggle-9cc92523-6607-40ad-9893-4175e7966b52.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; that OnlyFans has struggled to raise money from investors, citing its “porn problem” as a major cause. But sex workers were instrumental in the service’s growth — and despite its use by &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/blac-chyna-and-celebrities-who-have-made-onlyfans-profiles-2020-5"&gt;some film and music celebrities&lt;/a&gt;, its future &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/onlyfans-sex-workers-porn"&gt;without them&lt;/a&gt; is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s art-inspired Frame 4K TV is $200 off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpVgcsh0R4DUKmVc_yF-9anmN-8=/0x1005:4194x3801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768188/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Frame camouflages itself as wall art when you’re not using it as a TV. | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aofzh8"&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s HDR-compatible QLED that pulls double duty as wall art, is one of the more unique TV designs that didn’t die in the concept phase or on the showroom floor of CES. Designed to look like a framed and matted photograph, the 120Hz screen hides in plain sight when switched to an Art Mode that displays still imagery instead of a black void when turned off. It’s a stunner of a TV in many ways and, for a limited time, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are offering the 55-inch model for $200 off, the second-lowest price we’ve seen this year on the high-tech piece of home decor. It’s the perfect way to convince your friends you’re a person of culture and refinement while still being a techie nerd who loves large screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="StEUzN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZNP6n"&gt;If you use the larger 12.9-inch iPad Pro and want a more laptop-like experience, there are deals for both the previous-gen and newly revised Apple Magic Keyboards. Functionally the same, both Magic Keyboards augment the work and play capabilities of the iPad Pro with a quality trackpad and tactile keyboard that folds up to protect the screen. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927298996490402#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has the older model for $199 (a discount of $150) and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Keyboard-iPad-Pro-12-9-inch/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has the newer one for $324 (a discount of $25). The main difference between the two? The updated Magic Keyboard more adequately accommodates the slightly thicker dimensions of this year’s 12.9-inch iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BtRsMX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says old Magic Keyboard is ‘functionally compatible’ with new 12.9-inch iPad Pro, but warns of imperfect fit","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410350/apple-ipad-pro-mini-led-magic-keyboard-case-2020-model-fit-accessory-screen-protector"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="Cmzl61"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="4tTXe9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715671"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sLzcDa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google recently released&lt;/a&gt; a new version of its Nest Doorbell (formerly the Nest Hello) that lets you choose between battery or wired for power, and now the previous-gen wired model has received a sizable discount. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927503440938157#dotnotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-nest-hdr-video-doorbell-wired%2F-%2FA-52629447%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=Verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_doorbell_wired?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; are all currently offering $50 off the wired configuration, matching the price of the newer model at $180. The newer model might be more convenient and include a few additional enhancements, but with the previous model you’ll get slightly higher resolution capture and 24/7 recording without ever having to worry about charging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AUqG0V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10715814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tulrmO"&gt;Aside from its drones, DJI is most known for its expertise with gyros and stabilizers in the world of gimbals. The DJI OM 4 is its latest-gen mobile gimbal, and it allows for rock-solid stability when shooting videos with a smartphone. The OM4 normally sells for $149, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DJI-OM-Handheld-Smartphone-Stabilizer/dp/B08CMVGVQY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1582634-REG%2Fdji_cp_os_00000108_01_osmo_mobile_4_smartphone.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F24%2F22637841%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-apple-ipad-keyboard-nest-doorbell-dji-om4-gimbal-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; both have it for $20 off. Pairing this three-axis stabilizer and mini tripod with an iPhone or Android device that captures 4K video can enhance any vlogging or amateur YouTube setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li id="2P5Url"&gt;While the Sony A7III camera with kit lens saw a discount last week, you can now save on just the body.

    <title>League of Legends’ world championships moved from China to Europe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="League of Legends – 2020 Worlds - Finals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WXWfiWHD95YxHUuREgJrGhC1u5Y=/0x2:5200x3469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768108/1283224780.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by David Lee/Riot Games/Riot Games Inc. via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnBQ6n"&gt;The 2021&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;’ World Championship, the end-of-year tournament for arguably the biggest esport in the world, has been moved from China to a currently undisclosed location in Europe, Riot Games announced. The move happens just weeks before the competition is set to begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYLKRu"&gt;In a video, John Needham, global head of esports at Riot, said that travel restrictions and COVID protocols made it a challenge to hold the event in China. The move was &lt;a href="https://www.upcomer.com/sources-worlds-2021-moving-from-china-to-europe/"&gt;first reported Monday by &lt;em&gt;Upcomer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNpLXq"&gt;“After considering all potential options, we concluded that moving Worlds to Europe provided the best opportunity for the most teams and their best players to compete,” Needham explained. “We’re not ready to announce where in Europe Worlds will be held this year, but accessibility for the highest number of teams and their best players will be the key deciding factor.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D6MX9u"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ku5r8LEqqn0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a3HgQd"&gt;This will be the second major &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;tournament to take place in Europe this year, following May’s Mid-Season Invitational &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303379/league-of-legends-iceland-lol-mid-season-invitational-valorant-champions-riot-games"&gt;hosted in Reykjavik, Iceland&lt;/a&gt;. Worlds is typically a big annual showcase for Riot, with past events including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;an opening ceremony powered by holograms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;a mixed reality stage&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear if the shift in location will impact next year’s iteration of Worlds, which is slated to take place in North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONC4xI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s world championship isn’t the only esports event to have been moved in recent months. &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s The International, which kicks off in October, was first scheduled to happen in Stockholm, Sweden but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567520/dota-2-the-international-bucharest-romania-sweden-october-location-date"&gt;was moved to Bucharest, Romania&lt;/a&gt; because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545319/dota-2-the-international-valve-sweden-europe"&gt;restrictions on esports events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Xbox’s game showcase at Gamescom 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_ZWGp6keDiv0w5A3DVQHbgt5SY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768045/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lzKga"&gt;Some of the biggest Gamescom 2021 announcements are likely to happen during the Xbox stream. The stream will be a 90-minute blast that, according to Microsoft, will focus on “previously announced games” from its internal Xbox Studios and outside partners, as well as new titles coming to Xbox Game Pass. It’s possible that we’ll hear more about &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinit&lt;/em&gt;e, &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;, and more. I’m personally crossing my fingers for more &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt; news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNsoAJ"&gt;The stream will be presented in 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second, &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/23/how-to-watch-the-gamescom-2021-xbox-stream/"&gt;according to the Xbox blog&lt;/a&gt;, so don’t fret if things aren’t looking their best during the debut. Though, if you’d rather wait until a higher-res video is available, a 4K / 60 frames per second video will be released post-stream on the Xbox YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VuUlqb"&gt;When will the Xbox Gamescom event begin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lJHj7E"&gt;Tune in on Tuesday, August 24th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT / 6PM BST to watch the Xbox Gamescom 2021 event live. As previously mentioned, a stream will be uploaded to YouTube later in case you miss out on the events as they happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOhui3"&gt;Team Xbox made this handy guide to timing that might help you figure out when it’ll be streaming in your region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QmKXa4"&gt;Where can I watch the Xbox Gamescom event?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AQphM1"&gt;The Xbox stream will be presented live on &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/xbox"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xbox/hub"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; (embedded above), &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/xbox/"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/xbox/"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. It will be streamed simultaneously on Bilibili in China and VK in Russia. Xbox says it will be captioning the video in 30 languages, but they may not all be available during the livestream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVFmUk"&gt;The Xbox US YouTube page will host &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHwtF_xFiTk"&gt;a version of the stream with American Sign Language&lt;/a&gt; in English and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4kTMJnZaAw"&gt;one with audio descriptions&lt;/a&gt;, or in German Sign Language on the &lt;a href="http://YouTube.com/XboxDACH"&gt;Xbox Germany YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Movies Anywhere adds new, AI-powered list feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9MwKIpl-7H5yQgKCuSEskoxYeSA=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767959/My_Lists_Signed_In_Hero_16x9_Copy_10.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0wzbbd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/13/16464000/how-to-use-movies-anywhere-app-features"&gt;Movies Anywhere&lt;/a&gt; is best known as the service that syncs together purchased movies across different retailers (so that you can, say, watch movies you bought on iTunes through Google Play, or vice versa). But the service also has a fairly robust app of its own, which is getting a new machine learning-powered list feature to automatically generate lists that sort your library based on what movies you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBYnE2"&gt;The feature, aptly named “My Lists,” offers two options: automatically generated lists — like gathering all the &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; movies together or creating a list of the romantic comedies you own — and standard user-created lists. Users will be able to edit the automatic playlists (to add or remove movies that they feel fit the collection), and those lists will update over time when new purchased movies are added to your library.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AI4OCNlLKT8xvQRIN2DyH9E60Gg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801409/Screen_Shot_2021_08_23_at_5.45.26_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ieG4Ry"&gt;The way it works is simple: Movies Anywhere has already created thousands of those automatic playlists (my library offered me “Period Pieces,” “High-Energy Action Movies,” and “Whimsical Fantasies,” among others). It then scans users’ libraries of purchased movies, and using both the titles that a user owns and their watch history, selects what it thinks are the most relevant playlists to show (which is where the machine learning comes in).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4NlE9"&gt;The new feature is the latest addition to a series of updates that the company has added to its app, following other additions like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21182425/movies-anywhere-screen-pass-feature-share-loan-digital-movies-friends"&gt;Screen Pass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345413/movies-anywhere-viewing-party-feature-watch-together-screen-pass-lending-app"&gt;Watch Together&lt;/a&gt;, to try to convince customers to spend more time in it. But the My Lists feature also highlights the limitations of the service: namely, that it only works within the Movies Anywhere app. The playlists created there won’t sync to other services, nor can they draw on watch data on other platforms to help the algorithm decide which playlists to surface for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtA0AX"&gt;The new My Lists feature should be rolling out to Movies Anywhere users starting today. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make Android 12’s device control panel easier to access  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ivPFLdi9c-zHAoVBni7RkSZIAY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69767966/VRG_1777_Android_12_003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c8wzlT"&gt;One of the first things you might notice when you get Android 12 on your phone is that a standout Android feature is no longer where you expect it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9flbWp"&gt;I’m talking about the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/10065792?hl=en"&gt;device control panel&lt;/a&gt; Google added into the operating system with last year’s Android 11 release. The panel offers a handy set of commands that lets you access and adjust any smart lights and other connected gadgets set up in your home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBptAu"&gt;On Pixel phones, at least, that panel used to come up when you’d press and hold your phone’s power button. With Android 12, though, it’s no longer part of the power button menu. But don’t despair: it isn’t gone entirely. It just takes an extra step and a teensy bit of preparation to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J18hIY"&gt;Reposition your Android 12 device control panel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqArWj"&gt;First things first — track that panel down. In Android 12, the panel has moved from the power button menu into the Quick Settings area of the operating system (which is where some device-makers, including Samsung, had stashed it in Android 11, anyway).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axVU6u"&gt;By default, you’ll probably have to swipe down twice from the top of your screen and then maybe even swipe over to the left once or twice to find it. But with about 60 seconds of setup, you can move it to a much more optimal position:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Oc5cnu"&gt;Swipe down twice from the top of your screen to open up the full Quick Settings area. If you already see a “Device controls” control in one of the first four spots in that menu, you’re all set. Otherwise, you’ll want to do a little fine-tuning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VRwhrK"&gt;Tap the pencil-shaped icon in the lower-left corner of the Quick Settings area. If you’re using a phone other than a Pixel, you might have to tap a three-line menu icon and then look for an “Edit” command there instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lCeSJY"&gt;Find the “Device controls” tile, then press and hold it and slide it up to one of the first four positions in the Quick Settings area.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2KDJ6w"&gt;Tap the arrow in the upper-left corner of the screen to save and exit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d9YJtw"&gt;Now that the option is in a more prominent position, you can always get to it with just &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;swipe down from the top of your screen instead of two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Android 12, you must wipe down from the top of your screen for the device control panel button." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4uCcQsBywgvToUBsLd2DTse_iOI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801017/android_12_device_controls_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swipe down to get the button that takes you to the device control panel...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...which gives you quick access to all of your connected&amp;amp;nbsp;smart gadgets." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y3DxqNmvoRAQjX3TJc3ny5nIrHI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22801019/android_12_device_controls_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...which gives you quick access to all of your connected smart gadgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1pXEs"&gt;It’s still not quite as convenient as the old power button placement, admittedly, but it’s a step in the right direction — and at this point, it’s about the best you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2F3zT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNOE2v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify will let all US-based Anchor podcasters sell subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o70lUuFlz9cMe4yC0uAw5UHbrPw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69768006/Pod_subs_blog_inline_02.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wcwJNx"&gt;Spotify is broadening the number of people who can offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;subscription podcasts&lt;/a&gt; and have their shows play on its service. Today, the company announced that all US-based podcasters can use Anchor, its podcast creation and distribution platform, to sell subscriptions for exclusive episodes that’ll be available both through a private RSS feed and within the Spotify app, which doesn’t otherwise support private shows over RSS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUO7lU"&gt;Along with the expanded rollout, Spotify says it’s also adding more pricing options — 20 up from three — and is giving podcasters the ability to download their paying subscribers’ email addresses. This means they can stay in better touch with the group and also take that list elsewhere if they ever leave Anchor. (Listeners have to opt in to this.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4eDxet"&gt;International users will be able to sell subscriptions in the future, Spotify says, and they’ll be able to access paywalled content starting on September 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0soKn"&gt;As it has been since the subscription product first launched in April, Spotify won’t take a cut of revenue until 2023, at which point it’ll take 5 percent. There’s still no button to subscribe to shows directly inside Spotify, though, meaning that if a listener wants to subscribe to an Anchor podcast, they’ll have to navigate to an external website, likely through a link in a show’s notes, to do so. This means podcasters have to continue to shout out where listeners can find the link to subscribe, which adds friction to the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYy8vG"&gt;In contrast, Apple Podcasts’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534960/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-channels-shows-app"&gt;subscription product&lt;/a&gt;, which it launched in June and from which takes a much higher cut of revenue, comes with an in-app button. Apple won’t, however, provide podcasters with any specific contact information for their subscribers. All of these solutions are leading up to a world in which podcasters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630517/apple-podcasts-subscriptions-launch-dashboard"&gt;might operate multiple backends&lt;/a&gt;, if only to be present on every platform. Apple Podcasts requires podcasters to use its backend and manually upload episodes to it if they want to take advantage of the in-app button, while Spotify requires people host on Anchor to make listening on Spotify possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVfrZs"&gt;Spotify is also working on technology called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595013/spotify-open-access-podcasts-paid-access"&gt;Open Access&lt;/a&gt;, which works with third parties to bring paywalled content into the app, but those partnerships are currently preliminary, with most partners still developing the technology and integrating it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A guide to platform fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XyTj24P6kioSYNC-lI2mpiPCQGI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67438682/VRG_ILLO_4687_A_guide_to_platform_fees.7.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The hidden costs behind your favorite apps, games, and more&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iNHwd8"&gt;Online marketplaces like Etsy and Apple’s App Store allow businesses to flourish by connecting them to huge, global audiences. But these marketplaces are big businesses themselves, and in order to earn a profit, they take a cut of revenue from many of the other companies that use their space. It leads to a constant tension: apps like Tinder and &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be nearly the phenomena they are today without the App Store, but they have to constantly pay Apple for that privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOSXIP"&gt;Apps are just one example of how online platforms for small businesses and independent creators have shifted the world we live and work in. Membership platforms, like Patreon, allow creatives to charge monthly payments in exchange for new videos, comics, and essays. Video services like Twitch and YouTube allow creators to monetize their time through advertising revenue. And marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon allow people to sell an assortment of products directly to customers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5flZWs"&gt;The cut each platform takes varies significantly: Apple notoriously takes 30 percent of many digital in-app purchases; Twitch takes a 50 percent cut of subscription fees and a cut of advertising; eBay asks people to buy space and then pay a fee.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Knowing just how much each platform takes is crucial to figuring out what’s best for your business, or for understanding how the businesses you’re shopping from make money. Here are the various fees each platform takes, divided into four categories: app stores, creator platforms (including memberships, video services, and more), digital marketplaces, and games marketplaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="da0jpB"&gt;App stores&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kzShWw"&gt;App stores are where an enormous number of businesses operate. Whether someone is selling a line of jewelry on Etsy or spending oodles of money in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, app stores are the gateway to reaching people who shop on their phones and computers. Approximately 80 percent of Americans shop online, &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-e-commerce/"&gt;according to the Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt;, and more than half of those shoppers use a mobile device like a phone or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iwHDdJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple App Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYKQp1"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in App Store sales can receive 15 percent commission through &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apple-announces-app-store-small-business-program/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769807344&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0P0P5jBkjzYy3mt-xf5cP3"&gt;Apple’s App Store Small Business Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjDxJ4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Play:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases of digital goods and services; sales of physical products are exempt. Subscription commission falls to 15 percent after one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foAtEv"&gt;Google takes 15 percent in fees on developers’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333777/google-play-store-fee-reduction-developers-1-million-dollars"&gt;first $1 million in Play Store revenue&lt;/a&gt; every year. After the $1 million threshold, the rate goes back up to 30 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXAXaL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 30 percent standard commission &lt;a href="https://seller.samsungapps.com/help/termsAndConditions.as"&gt;on purchases through the app store&lt;/a&gt;, but it can be negotiated with Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBcY1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon App Store: &lt;/strong&gt;30 percent standard commission on apps and in-app purchases. Subscription commission is 20 percent on video apps and 30 percent on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjo4FI"&gt;Developers that make less than $1 million per year in app store revenue can receive a 20 percent commission and 10 percent in “promotional credits” for Amazon Web Services through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537726/amazon-app-store-cut-revenue-1-million-80-20-10"&gt;Amazon’s Appstore Small Business Accelerator Program&lt;/a&gt; for as long as they qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcVW3E"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Store:&lt;/strong&gt; 15 percent commission on apps and 12 percent commission on PC games starting August 1st, 2021. A 30 percent commission on all apps, games, and in-app purchases on Xbox consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsmi77"&gt;Non-game sellers can also &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/building-a-new-open-microsoft-store-on-windows-11/&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;source=editors&amp;amp;ust=1628805769796035&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2pcTZw9XK5Y0m1YuGgSipt"&gt;use their own payment system&lt;/a&gt; and avoid Microsoft’s commission entirely as of July 28th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="qZw43L"&gt;Creator platforms&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="SgT0wL"&gt;While app stores largely fit into the logic of their real-life, physical counterparts, an ever-growing breed of creator platforms allows people to monetize their personality and creativity more directly. Whether glued on to an existing social network like Facebook or reinventing old forms of entertainment like Clubhouse, creator platforms have found familiar ways to earn a buck on the backs of creator popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kw9kde"&gt;Membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pUePjZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patreon:&lt;/strong&gt; There are &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/pricing"&gt;three types of plans&lt;/a&gt; creators can enroll in, and each plan comes with a different cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aKTu7G"&gt;Lite plan: Patreon takes 5 percent &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xdqpTH"&gt;Pro plan: Patreon takes 8 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="27Ahq9"&gt;Premium plan: Patreon takes 12 percent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="4mMLwm"&gt;The tiers are geared toward different types of creators and businesses. The pro tier lets a creator offer tiered memberships to fans, while the premium tier provides a dedicated contact at Patreon who can provide support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7bsBU"&gt;Then, there are payment processing fees. For creators in the United States, Patreon takes 5 percent plus 10 cents for payments of $3 or less. Payments over $3 result in a 2.9 percent cut plus 30 cents going to Patreon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1g66UD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnlyFans: &lt;/strong&gt;OnlyFans takes 20 percent of subscription fees and other earnings, like tips. Creators can set their subscription fees between $5 and $50 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxLgHH"&gt;Tips &lt;a href="https://onlyfans.com/help/2/14/55"&gt;max out at $100&lt;/a&gt; for new users and go up to $200 for users who have had an account for four months or longer. You can tip $500 per day as a new user, with the limit increasing over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kl0STG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter: &lt;/strong&gt;Twitter offers an array of ways for creators to make money. Super Follows &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/super-follows-creator#sfstatus"&gt;allows creators to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; of $2.99, $4.99, or $9.99 per month in exchange for perks like exclusive tweets. &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces-ticketed-faq"&gt;Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; allow creators to charge for access to live audio events, with ticket prices ranging anywhere from $1 to $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmwxFS"&gt;For both products, Twitter takes a 3 percent commission on payments (after payment processing and in-app purchase fees, such as Apple’s 30 percent cut) until creators earn their first $50,000 on the platform, after which Twitter takes 20 percent. The features are only available to select users for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fREbo7"&gt;Creators can also &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/tip-jar"&gt;receive money directly&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter’s Tip Jar feature, which is currently in beta and only available to some users. Twitter doesn’t take a cut, but payments are subject to the processing fees of whatever third-party payment service is linked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRIGoN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook: &lt;/strong&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/646162679132229?id=558489708108283"&gt;lets creators offer monthly Fan Subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; and receive support directly from their followers. Facebook plans to take up to a 30 percent cut each month, but the company has announced it won’t be taking any fees until 2023. Apple and Google do take their typical cut on mobile, though, reducing creators’ share to 70 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZpksF"&gt;Facebook also offers &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/903272529876480?id=648321075955172"&gt;a tipping feature for livestreams called Stars&lt;/a&gt; — basically its answer to Twitch’s Bits. Creators get 1 cent per star, but (like Twitch below) viewers buy them for more than a penny each. If a viewer is buying only a few dollars at a time, Facebook might take upward of 18 percent of the money spent on tips. Creators also need to meet &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/understand-monetization-eligibility-status"&gt;Facebook’s eligibility requirements&lt;/a&gt; to enable Stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhjJ7q"&gt;Bulletin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555957/facebook-bulletin-newsletter-subscriptions-substack-competitor"&gt;Facebook’s newsletter product&lt;/a&gt;, currently doesn’t take a cut of subscriptions, though Facebook has so far limited the platform to a select group of higher-profile writers and personalities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tAXPLP"&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwLzwg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube: &lt;/strong&gt;Creators primarily make money on YouTube through ad revenue. YouTube takes 45 percent of revenue from ads and gives creators 55 percent, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2013/digital/news/youtube-standardizes-ad-revenue-split-for-all-partners-but-offers-upside-potential-1200786223/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuzLo7"&gt;YouTube also has a number of ways for creators to get paid directly by viewers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9MnA3"&gt;The platform lets channels offer memberships, which are &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9355861?p=cm_internationalpricing&amp;amp;visit_id=637360435699211837-3596854631&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;monthly subscriptions that run between $1 and $100&lt;/a&gt; in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePlvW1"&gt;Similar to several Twitch features, YouTube’s Super Chat, Super Stickers, and Super Thanks features give fans the ability to tip creators in exchange for perks like better comment placement in a livestream chat, custom stickers, and animations. Prices range from $1 to $500 for pinned Super Chat comments, $1 to $50 for Super Stickers, and $2 to $50 for Super Thanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dEWAAi"&gt;YouTube takes 30 percent of the revenue earned on memberships and Super features once taxes and applicable app store fees are deducted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNtIxX"&gt;Creators can also sell merchandise from select retailers directly to subscribers via the merch shelf underneath videos. YouTube doesn’t take a cut of merch sales, but creators may be subject to different fees depending on which of the 31 different supported retailers they partner with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3CbSp"&gt;YouTube also shares revenue from YouTube Premium subscriptions based on the amount subscribers watch a creator’s videos. The company has not disclosed how that money is divided, but YouTube tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; most of the revenue from Premium goes to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cvnha"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitch: &lt;/strong&gt;A creator can start making money from ads, subscriptions, and donations once they become a Twitch affiliate, which takes a certain amount of streaming and followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOlblB"&gt;Twitch typically takes 50 percent of subscription fees. Subscription pricing varies by country to reflect the local cost of living. As an example, a base subscription is $4.99 per month in the US but around $1.20 per month in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUmXvX"&gt;Twitch also offers streamers a way to be paid via donations using a virtual currency called bits. Twitch pays creators 1 cent per bit, so after receiving 100 bits, a streamer gets $1. The catch is, viewers pay extra up front to buy those bits: 100 bits costs $1.40 to buy on the web, or around $2 to buy on mobile to account for app store fees. That means anywhere from 29 percent to 50 percent of money spent toward tipping is being lost to fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SZwiB0"&gt;Streamers frequently accept donations through third-party payment platforms, too. Twitch doesn’t take a cut of these, but the platforms themselves may come with their own &lt;a href="https://donorbox.org/nonprofit-blog/twitch-donate-button-online-donations/"&gt;deductions for payment processing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1J8T"&gt;On top of subscriber fees, streamers also earn ad revenue — usually around $3.50 for every 1,000 views of an ad on their channel. For both subscriptions and advertising, bigger streamers may get better deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BAgG9v"&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rnekUT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clubhouse: &lt;/strong&gt; Live social audio app Clubhouse allows listeners &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/blog/introducing-payments"&gt;to pay creators directly&lt;/a&gt; via a “Send Money” button. Clubhouse doesn’t take a cut of the payments, and the person leaving the tip is asked to cover the payment processing fee from Stripe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Z3Y4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spotify: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its subsidiary Anchor, Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-27/spotify-ushers-in-new-era-of-podcast-monetization-with-new-tools-for-all-creators/"&gt;allows podcasters to offer subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify won’t take a cut until 2023, after which the company will charge a 5 percent commission. Creators have to cover payment processing fees out of their share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEvz7v"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;Subscriptions in Apple Podcasts&lt;/a&gt; are subject to the same rules as other subscriptions on Apple platforms: there’s a 30 percent commission to start, but if subscribers stick around for a year, the commission drops to 15 percent. Creators also have to pay $19.99 per year to offer subscriptions in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CNFQOj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discord: &lt;/strong&gt;Through its live audio feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22431438/discord-stage-channel-discovery-social-audio-threads-logo-clyde"&gt;Stage Channels&lt;/a&gt;, Discord offers creators the ability to sell tickets to their audio events. The feature is currently in a limited beta, and Discord hasn’t announced if it will keep a portion of ticket sales or when the feature will be available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="l1Hn6e"&gt;Writing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rsWmOU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tumblr: &lt;/strong&gt;A subscription feature, called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586765/tumblr-subscription-blogs-post-plus"&gt;Post Plus&lt;/a&gt;, lets creators offer subscriber-only posts for $3.99, $5.99, or $9.99 per month. Tumblr takes a 5 percent commission on subscription fees, and for subscriptions made through iOS or Android, creators will lose an additional 30 percent to the respective platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L56CvI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Substack: &lt;/strong&gt;The newsletter platform takes &lt;a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037607131-How-much-does-Substack-cost-"&gt;10 percent of subscription fees&lt;/a&gt;. Substack lets writers choose how much they want to charge newsletter subscribers per month or year. (There’s also a free tier.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHh9N7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wattpad: &lt;/strong&gt;Fiction publishing platform Wattpad offers a limited form of monetization for certain creators. &lt;a href="https://support.wattpad.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022692911-Paid-Stories-Program"&gt;Invite-only Paid Stories&lt;/a&gt; allows fans to purchase coins to unlock entries in an ongoing story or novel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ARgg"&gt;Currently, Wattpad sells coins in several different packages (you can get nine coins for 99 cents, for example) and chapters are usually priced at three coins each (though some go for more). Wattpad says writers receive the “majority of the revenue from the program,” but it has not publicly disclosed the exact split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tas7Ql"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kindle Vella: &lt;/strong&gt;Amazon has its own take on Wattpad’s Paid Stories, &lt;a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/help/topic/G5TFR9WSHB46ZKFN"&gt;called Kindle Vella&lt;/a&gt;. Writers who publish with Vella receive royalties based on the number of tokens spent on an “episode” in their story, with token cost determined by the episode’s length (one token per 100 words). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RFCNQ"&gt;Writers get to keep half of whatever a reader spent on the tokens they used to unlock their story, minus taxes and fees. The complicating factor is that Amazon offers tokens at different price points — you can buy 200 tokens for $1.99 or 1,100 tokens for $9.99 — so payouts can vary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq6k84"&gt;At those price points, for example, a writer who receives 100 tokens would either get $1 or 90 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Dvhlsk"&gt;Digital marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="aekChA"&gt;Digital marketplaces for physical goods are at the core of online shopping. Many of us use Amazon on a daily or weekly basis, or peruse eBay at work to keep an eye on the latest auctions. But while large businesses can be built on these platforms, their terms can be complicated to navigate and tend to ensure the platforms make a cut on just about every sale that goes through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ca9l9t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook and Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt; Facebook collects either 5 percent per shipment of products sold (one order can include multiple shipments if items are mailed separately), or a flat fee of 40 cents for shipments of $8 or less. This covers taxes, payment processing fees, and applies to all checkout transactions on both Facebook and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYoJCi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/223030991929920?id=533228987210412"&gt;Facebook is waiving the selling fee&lt;/a&gt; for all orders shipping through June 30th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWvS6P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon:&lt;/strong&gt; Amazon is a complicated one. First, &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/pricing.html?ref_=sdus_soa_wic_n#selling-plans"&gt;businesses can choose&lt;/a&gt; between using a professional selling plan, which costs $39.99 a month, or an individual seller’s plan, which has no monthly fee. Those on the professional tier do not have to pay a sales fee on items sold, while those on an individual seller’s plan pay $1 per sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Jqm4G"&gt;Amazon then takes a commission on each sale, including shipping fees. This fee depends on what the item is, typically ranging from 8 to 20 percent. There’s also a $1.80 closing fee for products listed under media categories, including books, DVDs, music, game consoles, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGMlxp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Etsy:&lt;/strong&gt; Etsy &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fsell%3Fref%3Dftr&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charges a 20-cent fee&lt;/a&gt; for people to list each item for sale. Then, for every product sold, Etsy takes a 5 percent transaction fee, and a payment processing fee of 3 percent plus 25 cents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0FDHHi"&gt;The company also runs an advertising program that’s somewhat controversial with sellers. Etsy pays to advertise their products on sites like Google, and then takes up to a 15 percent fee (but no more than $100) if they lead to a sale. Small sellers can opt out, but larger sellers have to participate; for them, Etsy only takes a 12 percent referral fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RDJv8F"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;eBay:&lt;/strong&gt; Generally speaking, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Ffees-and-features.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21445923%2Fplatform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBay sellers might pay a small fee&lt;/a&gt; to list a product and a 12.5 percent commission on the sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kIY9Z"&gt;Fees can vary significantly depending on product category and listing type, though. eBay also offers paid premium store features that can reduce fees. It’s a fairly complicated series of options — you can get a sense of some possibilities for paying stores from &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://pages.ebay.com/seller-center/run-your-store/subscriptions-and-fees.html#m22_tb_a2__2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21209964__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="8EauQs"&gt;Games marketplaces&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="im3fHn"&gt;From a single developer to a huge studio, being on Steam or in the PlayStation store is a big deal for distribution. These giant marketplaces are also key businesses for the companies that run them, often meaning steep fees on sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tjp36I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steam:&lt;/strong&gt; Steam takes &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838?content_only=true"&gt;30 percent of all sales&lt;/a&gt; made until the first $10 million. That cut becomes 25 percent when a developer sells between $10 million and $50 million. For every sale after the first $50 million, Steam only takes a 20 percent cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="No2ULR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Epic:&lt;/strong&gt; Epic takes 12 percent of the revenue from all games sold, giving developers 88 percent. Epic CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1120441795010338816?s=20"&gt;Tim Sweeney tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that of the 12 percent Epic collects, the company nets about 5 percent as profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtIZnS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PlayStation:&lt;/strong&gt; Sony is reported to take a 30 percent cut from games sold in the PlayStation Store, though the split isn’t publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNvkLf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xbox:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft &lt;a href="https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4OG2b"&gt;takes a 30 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from all games and in-game purchases sold through the console’s store under its standard developer agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMZpzT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Itch.io&lt;/strong&gt;: Itch.io takes &lt;a href="https://itch.io/updates/introducing-open-revenue-sharing"&gt;a radical approach&lt;/a&gt; to how it handles its revenue share with its independent creators. By default, the platform takes 10 percent of each transaction before payment providers take their cut. But if creators choose, as part of Itch’s open revenue sharing, they can lower that cut to zero or raise it to as high as 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nofJy8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 24th, 2021, 9AM ET:  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was originally published in September 2020; it has been updated and expanded for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
