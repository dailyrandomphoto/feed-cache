    <title>The latest GameStop stock dip looks like the end of the line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="gamestop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fUcvbW3Gf66pxzabVr6_zu9iQwE=/0x32:1100x765/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771381/GameStop_Store_Front_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CNBYIE"&gt;When GameStop’s stock price fell by over 50 percent on Tuesday, closing at $90, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;we weren’t sure if it was going to pick back up or keep going down&lt;/a&gt;. It seems we now have our answer, as GME is down another 41 percent, closing today at just $53.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sD8OHh"&gt;That's &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history/"&gt;less than the stock sold for&lt;/a&gt; the week before it took off on a wild rollercoaster ride induced by Reddit retail investors and an unprecedented social media frenzy. So it seems like we’re not so much in a dip, but on the long, slow ride back to the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB3j2r"&gt;When I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262546/gamestop-amc-stock-down-short-squeeze"&gt;about GameStop’s stock dip on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the stock was down 81 percent from its peak of $483. Now, it’s down 89 percent from that peak. There was always the chance of a rally (and I guess, technically, there still is), but it seems like the meme may truly be over. If it is, it’s a sad ending: anyone who bought the stock during the rush and has held on to it until now is in the red on GME.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Graph of GameStop’s stock over the past month." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5q2UGmhwg7QCoi08iRrbG0xIg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22282255/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_1.31.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple Stocks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re back to where we were before the big spikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Google union files labor board charge against contract company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gr_PWtwhgS0hsg5AjiNYAWC351Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771360/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KgZx2K"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) has filed an unfair labor charge against Adecco, a subcontracting firm that provides data center services to Google. The union says managers tried to stop Google contractors from discussing pay, which is illegal. Shannon Wait, a union member and contractor, was suspended after posting about working conditions on Facebook. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U78oHc"&gt;The charge is the first legal action the Alphabet Workers Union has taken to protect employees. Since the union went public in early January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;it’s called on YouTube to ban Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and voiced concern with the treatment of AI ethics researcher Margaret Mitchell, but both of these actions took the form of open letters and had no legal force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ByNUAh"&gt;Now, AWU is alleging that Adecco and Google retaliated against Wait after she posted about working conditions at a data center in Berkeley County, South Carolina. The complaint classifies the two companies as joint employers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njCn1R"&gt;Wait’s Facebook post centered in part on management’s refusal to replace broken water bottles at the facility. She said she’d joined the union to fight for better treatment for contractors, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay"&gt;according to an interview in &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are the backbone of Google,” she added. “We are doing the hard work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZVD1w"&gt;The charge also alleges Wait was retaliated against for her union support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lj3vhP"&gt;After Wait published the post, she was questioned by a supervisor. This same individual previously asked her not to talk about pay with colleagues after she inquired about some workers not receiving a promised bonus. Shortly after, Wait was suspended. Management said she was being investigated as a possible security risk, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3zmQV"&gt;“I want other TVCs [temporary, vendor, and contract employees] to see this and know they have recourse if they see something illegal or unethical in their workplace,” said Parul Koul, executive chair of the Alphabet Workers Union, in a press release. “Alphabet’s segregated, two-tiered employment system will not stand in the way of worker solidarity. We will continue to support Shannon and all Alphabet workers against unjust working conditions and fear mongering from management.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6L6FH"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niagara is a minimalist Android launcher I wish I’d had on my bus commute</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sHQI40ORAsdl-YM_pTV2MbVvYYk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771065/DSC00106.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Niagara Launcher puts your apps within easy striking distance of your thumb.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOd31n"&gt;After a couple years of beta testing, Niagara Launcher is now &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bitpit.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;available for download from the Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;. It’s designed to replace the default Android app drawer and home screen grid with a layout that’s easier to access with one hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZIrlX"&gt;You pick your favorite apps to pin on the home screen, and the rest are accessible under an alphabetized list on the right side of the screen in easy striking distance of your thumb. It’s quick and very responsive; you can either tap on the part of the alphabet you’re aiming for or swipe up and down to scroll your list of apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eS7Yah"&gt;Niagara also allows you to take quick action from the home screen by swiping across any app to bring up a list of options, like setting a new timer in the clock app or starting a session with Strava. Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen, and a swipe will expand this to show the full text without opening the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ukD9Cp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Favorited apps will also show a preview of notification content on the home screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p2csS7"&gt;These basic features are available with the free version, but customizing your home screen further with additional widgets and displaying your battery life percentage requires an upgrade to the paid pro version, which costs $6 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fr5uw5"&gt;Niagara features a clever design, and it would really come in handy on a big phone. I also would have appreciated it on my standing-room-only bus commutes in the Before Time, when I often clung to a rail with one hand for dear life while checking my email with the other. It’s pretty handy on a smaller phone, too, for a more informative look at your notifications without requiring you to open an app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hONDG7"&gt;The free version does not contain ads, which is another plus. Yet while the launcher does offer the basics, it’s a little bit of a letdown that it doesn’t let you add something as simple as a weather widget without paying for the upgrade. Overall, though, Niagara offers a clean look and a unique solution for those of us with one-handed woes.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap says its TikTok competitor already has 100 million monthly users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r-9qvqgfzetwFA8YD5MQSNHBdK4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68771024/snapChatPattern_BW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T9LAwZ"&gt;Snap says &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;its TikTok competitor&lt;/a&gt;, Spotlight, &lt;a href="https://investor.snap.com/news/news-details/2021/Snap-Inc.-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2020-Financial-Results/default.aspx"&gt;had 100 million users&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021, just two months after it launched. The figure would suggest a surprisingly successful debut for the service, which has taken over the far-right tab inside of Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C5wYl0"&gt;TikTok likely still has a significant lead on the new service, though. TikTok said it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/24/tiktok-reveals-us-global-user-growth-numbers-for-first-time.html"&gt;had 100 million monthly users&lt;/a&gt; in the United States alone as of June 2020, and signs suggest the app has only continued to grow since then. (On the other hand, Instagram’s leader has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;said he’s “not yet happy with” Reels&lt;/a&gt;, its shortform video competitor.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="TIujEw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Snapchat officially launches in-app TikTok competitor called Spotlight","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="t57Tg9"&gt;Snap has put a lot of money behind Spotlight in order to help the section catch on. The company promised to give away $1 million per day to creators for more than a month in order to get people posting videos, filling the service with fun stuff to watch. The initiative seemingly worked, with some creators seeing the service as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/style/snapchat-spotlight.html"&gt;a quick way to make a lot of cash&lt;/a&gt;. Creators are now uploading an average of 175,000 videos per day, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel said in prepared remarks for investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEXxqt"&gt;“While it is still very early in the development of this new content platform, we are highly encouraged by the initial results and excited about the potential for Spotlight to further expand our monetization opportunity in the future,” Snap CFO Derek Andersen said in prepared remarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akdsJ0"&gt;The feature is still far more limited than TikTok. Exploration options are limited, and you can’t remix sounds or go down a rabbit hole of dance videos to a popular song, bot features that have helped TikTok continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLJgLo"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Snap gave the figure in terms of monthly users when the company has long placed a focus on daily users overall. That suggests the daily usage of the feature is a good amount lower, given that someone only needed to open the tab once in January to be considered a monthly user. Snap now boasts 265 million daily users overall, up from 249 million the prior quarter, the company said in its Q4 2020 earnings release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is weighing an anti-tracking feature for Android, following Apple’s lead</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7GqZ7rzl3eJHMMEzH_uM2rn3p38=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770894/acastro_190228_1777_vpn_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OQOo4A"&gt;Google is considering developing an Android alternative to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253366/apple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch"&gt;upcoming App Tracking Transparency&lt;/a&gt;, a new planned opt-in requirement the iPhone maker will impose on developers that demands they ask for permission to track iOS users across apps and websites. The news, first &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/google-explores-alternative-to-apple-s-new-anti-tracking-feature?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, underscores the increasing pressure on large tech companies, many spurred on by Apple, to take more proactive measures to better protect user privacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkP3j3"&gt;Google won’t say whether it is indeed working on an anti-tracking privacy measure for Android. But in a statement, a Google spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “We’re always looking for ways to work with developers to raise the bar on privacy while enabling a healthy, ad-supported app ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2S3M4"&gt;First announced at Apple’s developer conference last summer, App Tracking Transparency effectively slides a system-level opt in between an app’s tracking capabilities and a user’s preferences. If the user says they would rather not be tracked, there’s nothing the developer can do to get around that because Apple will disable a developer’s ability to gather the so-called Identifier for Advertisers code, or IDFA. That code both lets advertisers track users from one app or website to another for ad targeting while also helping advertisers measure the effectiveness of ads, such as whether a user ends up purchasing a product they saw on one app by using the mobile website of the merchant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vdCIpJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency may not be as severe&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CWkW9z"&gt;Apple intends to police developers using audits and other methods to enforce its policies, which include potentially suspending or banning apps from the App Store if a developer does not comply. Both Facebook and Google have publicly expressed concern for how Apple’s opt-in requirement could negatively affect their mobile advertising networks. But Facebook has gone a step further and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;begun waging a public relations war&lt;/a&gt; against Apple over the change by complaining it will harm small businesses and accusing Apple of being self-serving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNoHfl"&gt;Google’s take on App Tracking Transparency would likely not be as severe, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. Instead of forcing opt-in requirements on app developers, the Android alternative may resemble some of the upcoming privacy controls planned for Google’s Chrome browser, in which the company seeks to end some of the more insidious tracking technologies on the web today by developing less invasive alternatives and giving users more opt-out mechanisms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf9YCA"&gt;Google’s work to develop new privacy practices and standards for the web is known as the &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-privacy/privacy-sandbox"&gt;Privacy Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. As part of that ongoing project, Google has taken steps to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349538/google-changes-ads-data-cookies-privacy"&gt;phase out third-party cookies on Chrome&lt;/a&gt; and is working on tools that allow advertisers to target groups of users instead of directly targeting individuals. All of this could inform how Google develops an anti-tracking measure for Android, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Smartmatic sues Fox News, Rudy Giuliani, and others over election disinformation campaign</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-ELECTION-TRUMP" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rF8vzfFRRyvvIFjYDz12d0TKHe4=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770796/1230450427.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brendan Smialowski / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZMjKjC"&gt;Voting tech company &lt;a href="https://www.smartmatic.com/uploads/Smartmatic_Complaint_Against_Fox_Corporation.pdf"&gt;Smartmatic has sued&lt;/a&gt; Fox News, former Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell, and TV host Lou Dobbs for spreading a conspiracy theory about the 2020 US presidential election. The New York state court lawsuit says Fox and others deliberately made Smartmatic the “villain” in a false story about fraudulent voting. Since then, it says, employees have received death threats, and clients have balked at the company’s tarnished reputation. It’s demanding $2.7 billion in damages and a full retraction of all false statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZo5Pf"&gt;Smartmatic figured heavily in a sprawling and baseless claim that former President Donald Trump won the 2020 election. The conspiracy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-smartmatic-ceo-biden-team-d/fact-checksmartmatic-ceo-is-not-on-bidensteamsmartmatic-software-is-not-on-dominion-voting-machines-idUSKBN2801ZJ"&gt;alleged that Smartmatic&lt;/a&gt; secretly owned its competitor Dominion and was founded by associates of long-dead Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in order to steal elections. (Smartmatic’s founders are from Venezuela, but they launched the company in Florida and deny any links to Chavez.) It also asserted that Smartmatic technology contained a “backdoor” that had let conspirators remotely change vote counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hjR1U6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smartmatic was roped into a sprawling conspiracy involving rigged votes and Hugo Chavez&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Txmsez"&gt;As Smartmatic notes, the company is unaffiliated with Dominion and played a minimal role in the election, providing software only to Los Angeles County. However, the claims received &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/voter-fraud-and-suppression/smartmatic-conspiracy-theories-proliferated-throughout-right-wing-media"&gt;widespread coverage&lt;/a&gt; on conservative news networks like Fox, often through Powell and Giuliani, who were promoting a &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/4ad3ad/sidney-powells-release-the-kraken-lawsuits-are-a-real-mess"&gt;fruitless legal fight&lt;/a&gt; to overturn the election results. “Defendants’ story was a lie. All of it. And they knew it,” the complaint reads. “Overnight, Smartmatic went from an under-the-radar election technology and software company with a track record of success to the villain in Defendants’ disinformation campaign.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfryjj"&gt;Smartmatic — which operates in several fields outside election tech — claims the disinformation campaign caused at least two commercial partners to suspend their business relationship. The complaint also says it has threatened employees’ safety. Soon after the reports started, the company was “inundated” with emails and voicemails, some claiming that “you all will be hunted” or that the only way to restore election integrity was to “shoot dead your company executives.” One caller allegedly harassed an executive’s 14-year-old son, and despite increased security, the threats have “left Smartmatic’s personnel shaken and scared.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PR9601"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Threats “left Smartmatic’s personnel shaken and scared”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PoCcme"&gt;The company previously threatened Fox and other outlets with a lawsuit, leading Fox hosts to air a video effectively contradicting their earlier segments. However, it argues that Dobbs (along with Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro, who are also named in the suit) never acknowledged the network had promoted false claims. And it says Fox “intentionally avoided” experts who might contract the false claims about Smartmatic, even after the stories were widely debunked elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApAiyz"&gt;A Fox spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; that “Fox News Media is committed to providing the full context of every story with in-depth reporting and clear opinion” and “will vigorously defend this meritless lawsuit in court.” Powell called the suit “another political maneuver motivated by the radical left that has no basis in fact or law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmkYtJ"&gt;Smartmatic’s competitor Dominion has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22249207/dominion-voting-systems-rudy-giuliani-defamation-billion-2020-election-donald-trump-sidney-powell"&gt;already filed lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; against Powell and Giuliani. Together, the cases will test whether libel law can defend some targets of disinformation campaigns — which often spread online but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/20/business/media/smartmatic-lawsuit-fox-news-newsmax-oan.html"&gt;start with major media networks&lt;/a&gt; and public figures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genetic testing firm 23andMe is going public via a SPAC backed by Richard Branson</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="23Andme" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ezYSxCHWCkkCY44Iw04hXsefZ2M=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770758/1061811696.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IcdhJO"&gt;Home DNA-testing company 23andMe will go public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) backed by Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, the &lt;a href="https://vgacquisition.com/"&gt;companies announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Is5UCY"&gt;“We have always believed that healthcare needs to be driven by the consumer, and we have a huge opportunity to help personalize the entire experience at scale, allowing individuals to be more proactive about their health and wellness,” 23andMe CEO and co-founder Anne Wojcicki said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScKPc8"&gt;The deal values the company at $3.5 billion, and current shareholders will own 81 percent of the company. Wojcicki and Branson each invested $25 million themselves as part of the $250 million fund formed to take the company public. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter, at which time the company will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol ME.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mq8dLG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As an early investor, I've seen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/23andMe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@23andMe&lt;/a&gt; develop into a company with enormous growth potential. Driven by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/annewoj23?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@annewoj23&lt;/a&gt;'s vision to empower consumers, and with our support, I’m excited to see 23andMe make a positive difference to many more people’s lives &lt;a href="https://t.co/BEAISMort5"&gt;https://t.co/BEAISMort5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q5PFb8Re0V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q5PFb8Re0V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Richard Branson (@richardbranson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1357301222479450119?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FxfaPe"&gt;SPACs, which grew in popularity in 2020, are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;formed by groups of investors with the intent of acquiring a company&lt;/a&gt;. Also known as a “blank-check” company, a SPAC is seen as a less-risky option than the traditional IPO, and it gives newer companies access to late-stage company amounts of capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8VN7pc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1JlGIS"&gt;Launched in 2006, 23andMe sells saliva kits people can use at home to determine their genetic ancestry and their chances of developing certain diseases. The company has an estimated 10 million customers in its database and says more than 80 percent of customers agree to participate in medical research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgGPyy"&gt;Wojcicki said Thursday that the funds will let the company expand into developing therapeutics, seen as a more lucrative market than consumer DNA testing, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/23andme-to-go-public-with-richard-branson-backed-spac-11612450687"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A slide deck announcing the deal showed the company sees big growth potential in the therapeutics market. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-6jnf30srVVkfSQ_T4tC8MT3oZs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22282023/23andme_slide.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;23andMe&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The slide deck from 23andMe SPAC presentation shows how much growth potential the company sees in therapeutics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4jHSan"&gt;Some blame the downturn in the popularity of DNA home testing on privacy concerns, including reports that the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/customers-handed-over-their-dna-the-company-let-the-fbi-take-a-look-11566491162?mod=article_inline"&gt;FBI had used genetic results from consumer DNA companies’ databases&lt;/a&gt; to solve cold case crimes. 23andMe and other firms have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/1/17638680/genetic-data-privacy-consumer-rights-guidelines-23andme-ancestry"&gt;promised not to share customers’ data without consent&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OubU8D"&gt;Wojcicki acknowledged a slowdown in the DNA home-testing market on Thursday. “We have always seen health as a much bigger opportunity” than DNA ancestry, she told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErJZNk"&gt;Branson, an early investor in 23andMe, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/23andme-to-go-public-as-3-5-billion-company-via-branson-merger"&gt;said Thursday&lt;/a&gt; “there is no better money to invest than in health care.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome is blocking popular extension The Great Suspender, but there’s a way to recover your tabs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VfUIJmI6mv4ZOly5Lc3GLKS9xeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770590/acastro_200207_3900_chrome_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f9GYXk"&gt;Google has apparently blocked The Great Suspender extension from Chrome, with existing users now receiving a message that it has “been disabled because it contains malware.” It’s also been removed from the Chrome Web Store, with &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg"&gt;any links to it&lt;/a&gt; now leading to a 404 page. Some are worried about losing their tabs, but &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit users have found a way to recover them&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers’&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1357397229980549126"&gt;Mishaal Rahman&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FrKyyM"&gt;The Great Suspender was a hugely useful extension — minus the malware, at least — for keeping your browser running smoothly. The tool would automatically shut down tabs that you hadn’t looked at for a while, replacing them with a blank gray screen. Return to the tab, and you could click to reload back to where you were. Given Chrome’s tendency to hog much of a computer’s memory, the extension was a simple way to keep your browser moving a bit faster, without actually forcing you to close old tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tSuIBvY0crMurfEZ6R1FC4rcTaU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22281952/Screen_Shot_2021_02_04_at_1.19.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The warning Chrome gives users if they have the extension installed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ABuZ9"&gt;If you used the extension and are looking to get your tabs back, the steps are simple, if a bit tedious. If the tabs were open, you can go to them and click into the URL bar. There will be a ton of text that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YKZ40Y"&gt;chrome-extension://klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg/suspended.html#ttl=%22Dawn%22%20Dario%20Marianelli%20(Pride%20%26%20Prejudice)%20Piano%20solo%20%26%20Tutorial%20-%20P.%20Barton%20-%20YouTube&amp;amp;pos=0&amp;amp;uri=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJXGLl_sEDU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="aHXQ8J"&gt;At the end will be the address for the page you were on. Deleting everything before the URL and hitting enter will bring the page back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MuNDxE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/lch3k5/warning_please_immediately_uninstall_the_great/gm0murs?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Reddit user avatar_ENG also discovered&lt;/a&gt; you can still get those tabs back by searching your Chrome history. It’s basically the same process as above: you search for the extension’s ID, klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg, then open the tabs and remove the junk. It may be an annoying process, but it’s better than losing any work or incredible memes you had open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZpscW"&gt;Neither Google nor the developers of the extension immediately responded to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter team up to crack down on hackers who steal rare usernames</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3xvqURkdPcl31BNC6cwc4Hxgy0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770421/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ssQNvO"&gt;Instagram has disabled hundreds of accounts that were stolen as part of online hacking operations designed to gain access to and sell rare and coveted usernames, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Both TikTok and Twitter also took action on some of the accounts belonging to the same hackers, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/02/facebook-instagram-tiktok-and-twitter-target-resellers-of-hacked-accounts/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+KrebsOnSecurity+%28Krebs+on+Security%29"&gt;reports journalist and cybersecurity expert Brian Krebs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJ6KGp"&gt;The Facebook-owned platform set its sights mainly on the community surrounding OGUsers, a website well-known for trafficking in stolen usernames and helping facilitate the hacking of these accounts through methods like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;SIM swapping&lt;/a&gt;, which is when a user gains control of someone’s phone number and uses it to reset passwords and take control of social media handles. News of Instagram’s enforcement was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-instagram-cyber-idUSKBN2A42HY"&gt;first reported on Thursday by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKTe4L"&gt;“Today, we’re removing hundreds of accounts connected to members of the OGUsers forum. They harass, extort and cause harm to the Instagram community, and we will continue to do all we can to make it difficult for them to profit from Instagram usernames,” a Facebook spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The disclosure is notable because it’s the first time the platform has publicly shared information regarding moderation against username hackers. Earlier this week, Instagram released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262154/instagram-recently-deleted-feature-update"&gt;new feature that lets people recover deleted posts&lt;/a&gt;, in the event a hacker takes control of their account and wipes it clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bXQ8C5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook and Instagram are taking action against online username-stealing communities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwDrTZ"&gt;Krebs reported on Thursday that the crackdown was something of a joint effort, with Twitter and TikTok also taking action against popular OGUsers community members at the same time on those companies’ respective platforms (although it’s unclear how much coordination there was between the three companies or how far-reaching TikTok and Twitter’s enforcement was). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UnmiCJ"&gt;“As part of our ongoing work to find and stop inauthentic behavior, we recently reclaimed a number of TikTok usernames that were being used for account squatting,” TikTok told Krebs in a statement. “We will continue to focus on staying ahead of the ever-evolving tactics of bad actors, including cooperating with third parties and others in the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiNeLO"&gt;In addition to disabling the accounts that were stolen, rendering them worthless, the social platforms have also disabled some accounts of well-known OGUsers middlemen who act as intermediaries during username transactions by holding funds in escrow in exchange for a cut of the fee, reports &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydl6Sr"&gt;OGUsers made headlines last summer when a small cohort of hackers affiliated with the site allegedly participated in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327769/twitter-bitcoin-scam-news-updates"&gt;unprecedented Twitter hack &lt;/a&gt;that involved resetting the passwords on the accounts of dozens of high-profile individuals and companies, including Elon Musk and Barack Obama, and using their access to run a bitcoin scam. Like the individual at the center of the Twitter hack, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355746/twitter-hack-teen-hearing-zoombombed-zoom-call-judge"&gt;then-17-year-old Graham Ivan Clark&lt;/a&gt;, many of the hackers Instagram is cracking down on today and those who frequent OGUsers are minors, often drawn into the community by the allure of stealing and retaining a rare username of their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FFNLnl"&gt;These usernames tend to be single words — in rare cases, individual letters or numbers — and they can fetch tens of thousands of dollars on underground markets for stolen digital goods. And because platforms like Instagram and Twitter have &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870"&gt;rules barring the buying and selling of accounts&lt;/a&gt;, the hackers interested in procuring one of these coveted handles often resort to illegal means to obtain them. SIM hacking is a popular method, but standard phishing as well as sustained online harassment, extortion, and even swatting are other known techniques, notes &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next victim of the global microchip shortage is Ford’s most profitable truck, the F-150</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-gXXx4sGzsUSGBbsteEa1nOnbs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68770242/All_new_F_150_006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bqCHrh"&gt;Many companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;have had to scale back car production&lt;/a&gt; due to a global computer chip shortage, but &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/04/ford-forced-to-cut-pickup-production-due-to-semiconductor-shortage-.html"&gt;CNBC is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that the shortages are finally hitting &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;America’s most popular vehicle&lt;/a&gt;: the Ford F-150. According to the report, Ford is temporarily cutting the number of shifts in its truck production plants in half: its Dearborn, Michigan, factory is going from three shifts a week to one, and its Kansas City, Missouri, plant is going from three shifts to two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tu7At1"&gt;CNBC quotes Ford spokesperson Kelli Felker as saying Ford expects the plants to return to normal operation in a couple of weeks, and the company is “working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKO0hg"&gt;This isn’t the first time microchip shortages have hit the car industry, or even Ford. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-china-production/chip-shortages-could-slow-automotive-production-vw-and-suppliers-say-idUSKBN28E1IN"&gt;Volkswagen had to change car production in December&lt;/a&gt; due to the shortage, and &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-cuts-car-production-on-massive-chip-shortage"&gt;Honda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/general-motors-hit-by-chip-shortage-will-cut-production-at-four-plants.html"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; have also had to cut back. &lt;a href="https://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2021/02/03/nissan-truck-production-reduced-canton-plant-due-chip-shortage/4369759001/"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-09/toyota-says-chip-shortage-impacting-output-of-texas-made-trucks"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt; have had to slow their truck production lines as well. For Ford’s part, earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22222166/semiconductor-shortage-ford-idle-kentucky-toyota-nissan-volkswagen"&gt;it had to shut down the factory&lt;/a&gt; that made Ford Escapes and Lincoln Corsairs for a week because it couldn’t get the computer parts it needed. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-13/overview-of-japan-carmakers-halting-output-due-to-chip-shortage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has an overview&lt;/a&gt; of how most of Japan’s automakers are affected one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLn9SS"&gt;While the shortages are hitting the entire industry, the F-150 is a big deal in the US, where the iconic F-series is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fmost-popular-cars%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F4%2F22266483%2Fford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the bestselling vehicle in the country&lt;/a&gt;. They’re also &lt;a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/why-the-ford-f-150-is-a-profit-machine"&gt;Ford’s most profitable vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, so making fewer of them isn’t likely to be a decision the motor company would make unless it had to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnLjnc"&gt;We here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; often ask the question “what’s a computer?” but I suspect most people wouldn’t answer “the F-150.” But modern cars have computer systems for almost every component these days, from digital speedometers to vital vehicle functions like controlling emissions and emergency brake systems. If Ford, or other car manufacturers, isn’t able to get the computer chips it needs, it won’t be able to build functioning modern cars.&lt;/p&gt;
