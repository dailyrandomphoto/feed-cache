    <title>Hyundai is getting serious about building a ‘walking car’ with four legs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZFxkJezBnfsvX3alKPmbbYwhxM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789893/006.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gYZV8A"&gt;Who needs an Apple car when you’ve got one with four legs? Hyundai, which recently acquired a controlling stake in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22167835/hyundai-boston-dynamics-aquisition-consumer-robotics"&gt;robot maker Boston Dynamics&lt;/a&gt;, rolled out the latest version of its four-legged “walking car” concept that it first unveiled in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OyRwk6"&gt;Hyundai is calling it TIGER, which stands for “Transforming Intelligent Ground Excursion Robot.” It’s the second vehicle to come out of the automaker’s Ultimate Mobility Vehicles studio in Silicon Valley, and the first designed to be fully autonomous. It’s like a real-life Transformer, just without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w6jLPX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s like a real-life Transformer, just without the “bent on world domination” vibe.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FYDGQ1"&gt;In fact, Hyundai actually thinks its four-legged vehicles have the potential to make the world a better place. The vehicles are designed specifically to access remote locations for missions related to scientific exploration, or to deliver food or medical supplies to disaster zones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l6cjtJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10332575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="siSTZZ"&gt;But how does it work? TIGER has four “legs,” each with a series of joints, enabling the vehicle to mimic both mammalian and reptilian walking gaits. According to Hyundai:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAoCxN"&gt;Based on a modular platform architecture, its features include a sophisticated leg and wheel locomotion system, 360-degree directional control, and a range of sensors for remote observation. It is also intended to connect to unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can fully charge and deliver TIGER to inaccessible locations...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDnx8x"&gt;With its legs retracted, TIGER drives like an all-wheel drive vehicle and is in its most efficient mode because it moves by rolling traction. But when the vehicle gets stuck or needs to travel over terrain that is difficult or impassable for wheels alone, it uses its walking ability to get unstuck or more easily travel over that terrain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5Y5Qen"&gt;If you’re getting a strong Mars Rover vibe off this thing, that’s on purpose: Hyundai thinks the technology underpinning this vehicle could make it ripe for an interplanetary mission. The walking car can traverse uneven terrain, climb a wall, step over a gap, and spread its legs to a 15-foot-wide track width — all while keeping its main cabin (and cargo) level. When not in the field, the vehicle’s legs are stowed underneath and can be driven like a normal off-roading vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHu3JC"&gt;The first four-legged concept, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173742/hyundai-walking-car-concept-elevate-ces-2019"&gt;called Elevate&lt;/a&gt;, was designed to carry passengers, while TIGER is meant to be completely uncrewed — no driver and no passengers. And while they may share some characteristics with Boston Dynamics’ robot dog, Spot, neither concept was designed with any input from the newly acquired robotics firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5f0fY"&gt;Hyundai was in consideration as a manufacturing partner for Apple, which is planning on launching its own electric vehicle. However, those talks broke down recently and Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia have sought to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/7/22271748/hyundai-apple-car-talks-stopped-report"&gt;downplay rumors&lt;/a&gt; it was working with the tech giant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehC3Oi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsciAp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will now take down posts claiming vaccines cause autism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nlUZ5n247AdcYwfqYChnltxdJJ4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789631/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7zzmqU"&gt;Facebook is expanding what false claims &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/04/covid-19-misinfo-update/#removing-more-false-claims"&gt;it will remove from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; related to COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccines, and vaccines in general starting today. The company began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150425/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-misinformation-ban"&gt;removing debunked COVID-19 claims&lt;/a&gt; in December of last year and notifying customers when they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177085/facebook-covid-19-misinformation-notifications"&gt;interacted with a post that has false information&lt;/a&gt; that same month. But now the list of potential claims that could get a post removed has grown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyRP1M"&gt;Highlights from &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/230764881494641/"&gt;the new expanded list&lt;/a&gt; of false COVID-19 and vaccine-related claims that will be removed include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="9vM27y"&gt;COVID-19 is man-made&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GCcJuD"&gt;Vaccines are not effective at preventing the disease they were created to protect against&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h4igga"&gt;It’s safer to get a disease than to get its vaccine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hjr4Uh"&gt;Vaccines are dangerous, toxic, or cause autism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wo3mKs"&gt;Facebook says it will start enforcing this policy immediately, focusing on groups, pages, and accounts that share content from its new list of debunked claims. The company also says it would consider removing the sources of the posts entirely if they became repeat offenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZkFT9"&gt;Notably, the company says that it will only be enforcing this change during the “COVID health emergency,” so while tamping down on such claims could be a major blow to the anti-vaccine movement on Facebook, it might not last long. Even if it remains brief, it’s an important change, Facebook was a major source of vaccine misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18225439/facebook-google-anti-vax-conspiracy-theories-pressure"&gt;even before the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and addressing it more directly could have a meaningful impact on people who might have otherwise become anti-vaxxers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LAODxW"&gt;Expanding what counts as COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation is a smart move for Facebook, but some people worry what posts might get caught in the company’s new, larger misinformation net. Studies into the effectiveness of certain masks, vaccines, and tests are still ongoing. As written, Facebook’s new guidelines might prevent conversations around new research results, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358851207763283971"&gt;UNC Professor Zeynep Tufekci notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AyXj9A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Looking at the list, Facebook may have to take down some current real news and public health statements, too. We have ongoing clinical trials with no placebo, for example. (UK heterologous prime boost trial) Also today's reports on ChAdOx1? May need to go under these guidelines. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iCCNi6eeBT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iCCNi6eeBT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358844175085686788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLeFC8"&gt;What’s more, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1358843227982471168"&gt;Tufekci points out&lt;/a&gt;, recommendations from public health agencies have changed over the course of the pandemic, which may mean that older posts from organizations like the World Health Organization may also be removed. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Facebook with these concerns and will update if we learn more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tfcYpO"&gt;Outside of those policy changes, Facebook is also making adjustments to how factual COVID-19 information &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reaching-billions-of-people-with-covid-19-vaccine-information/"&gt;gets delivered on Facebook and Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. The company will feature links to vaccine information and for signing up to receive a vaccination in its COVID-19 Information Center, and it plans to bring the feature to Instagram as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85QFBM"&gt;Facebook also says that its continuing to improve search on both platforms to surface more “relevant, authoritative results” when a user searches something related COVID-19, including displaying users who discourage vaccinations lower in search results on Instagram. Finally, Facebook is extending $120 million in ad credits to “help health ministries, NGOs, and UN agencies” spread COVID-19 vaccine information to Facebook’s billions of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkDXbh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1LXNW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom adds facial effects so you can look your weirdest during meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Zooms new Studio Effects feature lets you add facial hair, lip color and eyebrows in any color." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUtLQ47mtmLcKg3C0Qsg6eIT-iQ=/14x0:1073x706/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789546/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.19.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOH6fb"&gt;While Zoom was originally created as a serious meeting application for businesses, it has since become one of the most-used services during the pandemic for anyone who wants to have a face-to-face virtual conversation. As a result, the company has been adding more fun stuff, such as weird backgrounds, to use for online family gatherings, friend chats, and well, for business meetings. And now, it’s come up with a feature called Studio Effects that gives you the ability to add a variety of eyebrows, facial hair, and lip color to your video image during Zoom sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJ5rUG"&gt;The feature, still in beta, isn’t really new — &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360049041052-New-Updates-for-September-21-2020"&gt;Zoom announced it in September 2020&lt;/a&gt; — but this is the first time &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ParkerMolloy/status/1358880050989457408"&gt;many Zoom users are first discovering it&lt;/a&gt;. At any rate, it’s easy to find. Start up a Zoom session and go to Video Settings (which is found by hitting the arrow next to “Stop Video” at the bottom of the screen). From there, select “Background &amp;amp; Filters” and look for “Studio Effects (Beta)” in the lower right-hand corner. (You may need to download the effects package first — go ahead, it will only take a minute.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Click on “Studio Effects (Beta)” and you can change your look from this to the more interesting one above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QvX_dTAmywDIr726S5AYAqskmZo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290673/Screen_Shot_2021_02_08_at_1.17.15_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on “Studio Effects (Beta)” and you can change your look from this to the more interesting one above.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lNlKdH"&gt;After that, you can affect any look you want. Always wanted Groucho Marx eyebrows or a villainous goatee or bright green lipstick? It’s there for the trying. And you can set your facial effects for either just that meeting or for every meeting you’re in (which may not be a good idea if you think you may have a last-minute job interview coming up).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HJCH3"&gt;We’ve reached out to Zoom to find out how widespread this new feature is (so far, several staffers here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have reported seeing it in their Zoom applications). Personally, while this is a lot of fun, I’m hoping that Zoom will add hairstyles to its Studio Effects — those of us who are still suffering from pandemic hair (in other words, who haven’t visited a hair salon in about a year) would be extremely grateful.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A West Virginia newspaper chain is suing Google and Facebook over digital ad revenue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mquqLy9a1IyNvqfDZKqWOIv6LZc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789532/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FlgPHE"&gt;The parent company of a West Virginia newspaper chain has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook and Google parent company Alphabet, alleging the platforms are siphoning away much-needed digital ad revenue. It &lt;a href="https://www.editorandpublisher.com/stories/hd-media-files-first-of-its-kind-antitrust-lawsuit-against-google-and-facebook,185360#"&gt;appears to be the first such lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; by a news organization against the digital giants and makes the argument that the platforms represent a digital monopoly that should be broken up, like Standard Oil or AT&amp;amp;T were back in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGSDvu"&gt;“Google and Facebook have monopolized the digital advertising market thereby strangling a primary source of revenue for newspapers across the country,” according to the complaint filed by HD Media, which operates the Pulitzer Prize-winning &lt;em&gt;Charleston Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; and several other West Virginia newspapers.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;The company bought the &lt;em&gt;Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; out of bankruptcy in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRou7P"&gt;Doug Reynolds, president of HD Media, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a telephone interview that the company decided it was time to challenge the status quo in the digital ad marketplace, not just for its own newspapers but for the entire news industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqGoNP"&gt;“In the last 18 months, we more than doubled our digital subscriptions. Our readers pay good money to engage with our content digitally,” Reynolds said. “We were trying new products, like newsletters and podcasts, and we kept reaching more people. But our revenue kept going down.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcJNGb"&gt;Google and Facebook designed the current ad revenue ecosystem, then competed on the playing field they created, Reynolds added. “Then, they’re keeping score on the same playing field,” he said. “It’s an untenable position.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXPuAu"&gt;The suit filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia refers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"&gt;last year’s House Judiciary report&lt;/a&gt; that examined whether the practices of Google, Amazon, Apple, and Facebook violated antitrust laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8tW7ik"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Congress releases blockbuster tech antitrust report","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504814/congress-antitrust-report-house-judiciary-committee-apple-google-amazon-facebook"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JEoywq"&gt;“As set forth in the House Judiciary Report, Defendants’ anti-competitive and monopolistic practices have had a profound effect upon our country’s free and diverse press, particularly the newspaper industry,” the complaint states. It then lists some sobering statistics about the newspaper industry: ad revenue fell by more than 50 percent between 2006 and 2017, and 20 percent of newspapers have closed over the past 16 years. “The reduction in revenues to newspapers across the country, including Plaintiff, were directly caused by Defendants’ conduct,” according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttyh4x"&gt;The complaint is similar to a case in Texas last year, which alleged Google and Facebook worked together to sabotage “header bidding,” which allowed advertisers, including competitors, to bypass Google’s ad auctions. Texas state Attorney General Ken Paxton said Google “repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing” in online ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IAeZEf"&gt;The West Virginia suit alleges that Google and Facebook, normally rivals in the digital ad market, had a secret agreement code named “Jedi Blue.” That deal, the suit claims, was a quid-pro-quo where “Facebook would largely forego its foray into header bidding and would instead bid through Google’s ad server. In exchange, Google agreed to give Facebook preferential treatment in its auctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GxgRSa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; first reported on the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/17/technology/google-facebook-ad-deal-antitrust.html"&gt;existence of the Jedi Blue program&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year based on redacted references from the Texas case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtirH5"&gt;Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-misleading-attack-on-our-ad-tech-business/"&gt;pointed to a blog post Google released earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; in response to the Texas complaint, particularly a section that highlighted what he said were “mischaracterizations about our Open Bidding agreement with Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZKw4"&gt;According to the blog post, open bidding works with “a range of ad networks and exchanges to increase demand for publishers’ ad space, which helps those publishers earn more revenue. [Facebook Audience Network]’s participation helps that. But to be clear, Open Bidding is still an extremely small part of our ad tech business, accounting for less than 4 percent of the display ads we place.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpXPSG"&gt;The company does not manipulate the open bidding process in Facebook’s favor, the post states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpP3IH"&gt;Facebook did not reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnNPt4"&gt;Reynolds says he expects the suit to take several years to resolve, but he’s prepared for a long battle. “I think my preference would be for these companies to be broken up the way Standard Oil and AT&amp;amp;T were,” he added. He says when he bought the &lt;em&gt;Gazette-Mail&lt;/em&gt; in 2018, readers clearly understood the intrinsic value of having a thriving local newspaper, something Reynolds believes is in danger if the industry can’t figure out how to get control of its ad revenues again. “There will be no local newspaper coverage in ten years if we don’t win this suit,” Reynolds said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This laptop has seven times the average number of screens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mp7bdSSOZxpfsILFOdQ__IbhrYo=/1x0:2539x1692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789392/aurora7hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Expanscape&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6tkVC"&gt;A company called Expanscape has created the most Inspector Gadget-like device that I’ve ever seen. It’s a laptop prototype called the Aurora 7 (a working title), and attached to its humongous black box of a chassis are six extra displays that extend out in every direction away from the main screen, each showing its own windows and applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdXSlV"&gt;If you’re like me, the first thought that comes to mind is “that poor hinge!” Yeah, poor hinge, indeed. Many laptop hinges don’t gracefully handle having one screen attached, let alone seven. Piggybacking on the main 17.3-inch 4K display are three other screens of the same size and resolution. Above the left and right displays is a single seven-inch 1200p monitor. You’ll also find one more seven-inch 1200p touchscreen display mounted into the wrist rest. This prototype weighs about 26 pounds and is 4.3 inches thick. It has an imposing, intimidating presence, and I haven’t even seen it in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Expanscape Aurora 7 prototype" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/huWkTCK7lkya3iCRoLs41k-RvCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22290505/aurora73.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Expanscape&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bow down to the Aurora 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P9VQQo"&gt;What GPU is responsible for powering its four 4K displays? None other than the midrange Nvidia GTX 1060, which isn’t exactly a powerhouse. It also has an Intel Core i9-9900K processor and 64GB of RAM. You can find more specs &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/aurora-7-prototype-specifications/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In future revisions, Expanscape wants to use the Nvidia RTX 2070 instead, with options for the AMD Ryzen 9 3950x processor or Intel’s i9-10900K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xl7BtJ"&gt;Even though it’s built primarily to be a mobile security operations station (and stay plugged pretty much all the time), maybe it’ll be able to run some games, too. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/its-no-surprise-this-absolutely-obscene-7-screen-laptop-1846222859"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; noticed in its write-up of this gadget that its current prototype can last for just one hour before the battery cries for more power, which is frankly longer than I expected. It uses a secondary 148Wh battery just to power its additional displays, and that’s over the FAA’s legal limit to fly in a plane. Expanscape says it’s working to remedy this in future prototypes. In other words, the company is committed to letting you &lt;em&gt;bring a seven-screen laptop onto a plane&lt;/em&gt;. You’d probably have to buy a whole row of seats for the necessary space to use it, though. (If you’re reading this in the future, please take a picture of one of these if you see it on your plane.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nrQ8j0"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Razer’s laptop with three screens is unreal|25617" data-volume-uuid="2868e7566" data-volume-id="25617" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-723" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nEk5xO"&gt;Sure, the Aurora 7 looks more rough around the edges than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/5/14112686/razer-project-valerie-multi-monitor-gaming-laptop-concept"&gt;Razer’s triple-screened Project Valerie laptop&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago. But nevertheless, Expanscape claims it’s willing to actually sell this thing, which is more than Razer can say about its Valerie concept. If you want to buy one, &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/a7-m3-prototype-pricing/"&gt;Expanscape says it can help interested parties in reserving a prototype of its upcoming revision&lt;/a&gt;. As for the price, the company will ask you to sign a nondisclosure agreement, prohibiting you from publicly sharing the cost. That doesn’t bode well for the bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKcYF"&gt;I look forward to hearing more about future revisions of the Aurora 7, especially if it gets a button that makes all of the displays pop open in a comical fashion. Currently, it seems like &lt;a href="https://expanscape.com/the-aurora-7-prototype/screen-transition-method/"&gt;an extremely manual process&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers tampered with a water treatment facility in Florida by changing chemical levels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Il4jxUZwM1cWsdNFhYRMlNLCJxs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789271/acastro_180109_1777_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XQGUMk"&gt;Hackers successfully infiltrated the computer system controlling a water treatment facility in the city of Oldsmar, Florida, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In doing so, the hackers were able to remotely control a computer to change the chemical levels of the water supply, increasing the amount of sodium hydroxide before a supervisor was able to catch the act in real time and revert the changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZA5BE"&gt;“At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated,” Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said during a press conference on Monday, which was &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkXDSOgLQ6M&amp;amp;ab_channel=PinellasSheriff"&gt;later posted to YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. “Importantly, the public was never in danger.” Sodium hydroxide, commonly known as lye, is used in water to regulate acidity levels, the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;reports, but in excess it can be dangerous to human beings because it’s the same inorganic compound used in corrosive household cleaners like Drano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fgm2L5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers tried to increase the amount of lye in the water supply&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSIirC"&gt;Although no one was injured, the incident is a disturbing example of hackers taking aim at public infrastructure with unclear intentions. Pinellas County is currently investigating the hack alongside the FBI and the Secret Service. Other nearby cities and towns have also been alerted to the potential threat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khpWNP"&gt;It is not the first incident of water supplies being targeted — a water utility in Illinois was &lt;a href="https://wsabc.ca/water-utility-hacked-are-our-scada-systems-at-risk/"&gt;targeted by suspected Russian hackers&lt;/a&gt; in November of last year, while an attempted cyberattack on Israel last year that intelligence officials have linked to Iran involved attempts to manipulate the water supply, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/intelligence-officials-say-attempted-cyberattack-on-israeli-water-utilities-linked-to-iran/2020/05/08/f9ab0d78-9157-11ea-9e23-6914ee410a5f_story.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01MjXM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times &lt;/em&gt;has a rather chilling anecdote in its &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/pinellas/2021/02/08/someone-tried-to-poison-oldsmars-water-supply-during-hack-sheriff-says/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; detailing the moment the remote plant operator noticed something was terribly wrong, when his mouse started moving on-screen without him touching it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2itqJO"&gt;A plant operator was monitoring the system at about 8 a.m. Friday and noticed that someone briefly accessed it. He didn’t find this unusual, Gualtieri said, because his supervisor remotely accessed the system regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3g0Nj"&gt;But at about 1:30 p.m. the same day, Gualtieri said, someone accessed the system again. This time, he said, the operator watched as someone took control of the mouse, directed it to the software that controls water treatment, worked inside it for three to five minutes and increased the amount of sodium hydroxide from 100 parts per million to 11,100 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7bAEM"&gt;The attacker left the system, Gualtieri said, and the operator immediately changed the concentration back to 100 parts per million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="csJiEt"&gt;The county says there are other safeguards in place that would have prevented direct harm to the 15,000 or so residents that rely on the Oldsmar plant for drinking water. For one, the water would have taken more than a day to enter the water supply, the sheriff says, meaning ample public warnings could have been issued in that time. There are also “redundancies in the system” that would have caught changes to the acidity of the water supply, the sheriff says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department drops challenge to California net neutrality rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUReDjnJkKCtMLNTS6_FAWgdqVc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789186/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0ONEO"&gt;The Justice Department dropped its 2018 lawsuit challenging California’s state net neutrality rules on Monday, removing one of the law’s major roadblocks preventing it from going into effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3qlBO"&gt;In 2017, the Trump Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;voted to repeal&lt;/a&gt; the Obama-era internet regulations banning internet service providers, like AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon, from throttling or blocking traffic and implementing paid fast lanes. The following year, California passed its own law instituting net neutrality rules at the state level. That law &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-net-neutrality-lawsuit-against-state-california-0"&gt;was quickly challenged&lt;/a&gt; by the Trump-led Justice Department, which argued that California’s law was preempted by the FCC’s 2017 repeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8OSmX"&gt;“I am pleased that the Department of Justice has withdrawn this lawsuit.  When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its net neutrality policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws,” FCC Acting Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement Monday. “By taking this step, Washington is listening to the American people, who overwhelmingly support an open internet, and is charting a course to once again make net neutrality the law of the land.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AXmRr8"&gt;California’s law has yet to go into effect due to separate legal challenges, independent of the Justice Department case. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-justice/u-s-drops-challenge-to-california-state-net-neutrality-law-idUSKBN2A82D1"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, another challenge to the law brought by industry groups is pending a February 23rd hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZRfH0"&gt;Former FCC Chairman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;Ajit Pai stepped&lt;/a&gt; down from the agency last month when President Joe Biden was inaugurated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;Rosenworcel currently chairs&lt;/a&gt; the agency in an acting capacity, and it’s unclear when Biden will nominate an official replacement for Pai.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA takes a big step into mobile with acquisition of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood developer Glu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electronic Arts Inc. Event Ahead Of 2018 E3 Electronic Entertainment Expo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xl-Ail1BD5cMduprBgMvKC1Lq4I=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68789167/970613582.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eq2YZf"&gt;EA is making a big move into the world of mobile gaming with the acquisition of Glu Mobile, a developer best known for its work on celebrity-focused titles, based on stars like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/16/10287726/katy-perry-pop-glu-mobile-game"&gt;Katy Perry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/4/5966973/kim-kardashian-game"&gt;Kim Kardashian&lt;/a&gt;. Its portfolio also includes popular titles like &lt;em&gt;Design Home&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Covet Fashion&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;MLB Tap Sports Baseball&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;EA says that once the deal is closed, it will have acquired Glu for “$2.1 billion in enterprise value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="L1XCzF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re doubling the size of our mobile business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4Rw1O"&gt;“Mobile continues to grow as the biggest gaming platform in the world, and with the addition of Glu’s games and talent, we’re doubling the size of our mobile business,” EA CEO Andrew Wilson said in a statement. EA says that it currently has a mobile audience of more than 100 million monthly active players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzEBuj"&gt;The move is analogous to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9662214/actvision-blizzard-buys-candy-crush-king-5-9-billion"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s acquisition of &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush&lt;/em&gt; maker King in 2015&lt;/a&gt;, serving as an expensive way to break into the lucrative mobile space. During its recent Q4 earnings statement, Activision said that King raked in $577 million in net revenues, not far from Blizzard’s $579 million. King is also now tapping into existing Activision franchises with the upcoming release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21317994/crash-bandicoot-mobile-ios-android-candy-crush-saga-temple-run"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash Bandicoot: On the Run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="255j6B"&gt;There’s no word on what new projects Glu might be working on under the EA umbrella, though the publisher said that Glu’s experience with casual games coupled with EA’s “industry-leading IP in sports and beyond” are a big reason behind the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot company Chowbotics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uSFHDCqHpj547zcTZemp8c4H1WI=/161x0:2539x1585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788641/chowbotics.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Salad vending machine company Chowbotics is now part of DoorDash&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AEYUQi"&gt;DoorDash has acquired salad-making robot startup Chowbotics, the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@DoorDash/welcoming-chowbotics-to-the-doordash-team-cf0b59c4ce94"&gt;companies announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed, but the Chowbotics team have all become DoorDash employees, and the company will operate independently within DoorDash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3hLeh"&gt;“We have long admired the work that Chowbotics has done to increase access to fresh meals, with its groundbreaking robotics product and vision,” DoorDash co-founder Stanley Tang said in statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “With the Chowbotics team on board, we can explore new use cases and customers, providing another service to help our merchants grow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kIKHS9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bPeE-zfU00w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keVa67"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.chowbotics.com/about-us/"&gt;Chowbotics&lt;/a&gt; was founded in 2014, and its fresh food robot Sally — a rectangular machine that’s essentially a salad vending machine — can create customizable salads, grain and poke bowls, parfaits, cereals, and snacks all within a small space. The robot is used by companies like universities, hospitals, and grocery stores, according to a blog post from DoorDash general manager Penn Daniel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWyMuI"&gt;DoorDash currently has the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/edison-discovers/q4-2020-food-delivery-rideshare-sales-report-70382329c1b1"&gt;greatest share&lt;/a&gt; of the US food delivery market, around 48 percent, ahead of rivals like UberEats and Grubhub. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;Its revenue skyrocketed in 2020&lt;/a&gt; as restaurants closed in-person dining due to the pandemic and customers relied on delivery services. But when DoorDash went public late last year, its IPO was criticized by some analysts as lacking in value; they questioned how DoorDash would be able to continue to grow if demand for food delivery subsides once the pandemic is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a9WDK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/doordash-ipo-most-ridiculous-david-trainer-bailing-out-private-investors-2020-12-1029870440"&gt;Analyst David Trainer of New Constructs said at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We think this proposed public equity offering holds no value, $0, beyond bailing out private investors before unsuspecting public investors realize the business is not viable in its current form.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT8HQQ"&gt;But the Chowbotics acquisition raises interesting questions about DoorDash’s post-pandemic plans. Daniel wrote in the blog post that Chowbotics will allow DoorDash to help the restaurants that use its delivery platform expand their offerings. It seems likely that Chowbotics’ vending machines would fit into the ghost kitchen model, which are delivery-only restaurants that &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/21540765/ghost-kitchens-virtual-restaurants-covid-19-industry-impact"&gt;some in the industry regard warily&lt;/a&gt;. DoorDash has a &lt;a href="https://www.nrn.com/delivery-takeout-solutions/doordash-launches-program-revive-closed-restaurants-using-ghost-kitchens"&gt;ghost kitchen facility&lt;/a&gt; in California, and last year announced it was working with Chicago restaurant Krazy Hog — which closed in-person dining during the pandemic — as part of its &lt;a href="https://blog.doordash.com/helping-restaurants-to-reopen-for-delivery-4326c4edf29d"&gt;Reopen for Delivery&lt;/a&gt; initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XB4yXR"&gt;If you’re ordering for delivery, chances are you’d never know whether your salad was made by a Chowbotics robot or a human unless the restaurant tells you. It’s not uncommon for restaurants to brand their delivery operations under a different name — like when some diners discovered the &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-e-cheese-pasquallys-grubhub_l_5ec2dd89c5b646534f558efa"&gt;pizzas they ordered from “Pasqually’s”&lt;/a&gt; actually came from kids’ eatery Chuck E. Cheese. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New California law would exempt employees who speak out about discrimination from NDAs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Legislature in session at Capitol in Sacramento,CA." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pqlu_2ZgnvmYcy_wNyOwomCG_kw=/56x0:4145x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68788548/1230682089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Gina Ferazzi / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c9dXsf"&gt;On Monday, California state Senator Connie Leyva introduced the Silenced No More Act, a bill that advocates say will protect employees who speak out about discrimination at work, even if they’ve signed nondisclosure agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="raHVAj"&gt;“SB 331 will prevent workers from being forced to sign non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements that would limit their ability to speak out about harassment and discrimination in the workplace,” Leyva said in a statement. “It is unacceptable for any employer to try to silence a worker because he or she was a victim of any type of harassment or discrimination—whether due to race, sexual orientation, religion, age or any other characteristic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga9tqL"&gt;The newly introduced legislation builds on work by Ifeoma Ozoma, a former Pinterest employee who went public in June, alongside her colleague Aerica Shimizu Banks, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;with allegations of racism and sexism&lt;/a&gt; at the company. Ozoma knew she was partially covered by a California law called CCP 1001, which passed in the wake of the Me Too movement to protect employees speaking out about sex discrimination in the office. But she also realized the law had serious limitations: it didn’t account for other forms of workplace harassment, including racism, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YJu9Mb"&gt;“If Pinterest decides to sue me, they’d have to state affirmatively that the discrimination I faced was not because of my sex — it was because of my race,” &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/Policy/new-california-law-ndas"&gt;Ozoma said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This has been the only time being a Black woman was a double-bind for the other person, not for me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC7eeJ"&gt;After she went public, Ozoma started working to expand CCP 1001 protections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpqEXk"&gt;If successful, the law would have a dramatic impact on the tech industry, which is famous for making workers sign strict nondisclosure agreements. These NDAs can include broad non-disparagement clauses which prevent employees from speaking out. The rule is especially hard for contract workers who often lack the protections and resources of full-time employees. In recent years, contractors at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; have chosen to speak out anyway — and risked retaliation as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ynpnv"&gt;The Silenced No More Act, which is jointly sponsored by the California Employment Lawyers Association and Equal Rights Advocates, covers “every discrimination category under California law,” &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; reports. This includes race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, ancestry, disability, and age, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RrE8Q"&gt;“NDAs are inherently harmful because they prevent workers from speaking out against abuses in the workplace,” said Jessica Stender, senior counsel for workplace justice and public policy at Equal Rights Advocates. “We are proud to cosponsor SB 331, which will prohibit forced NDAs related to all forms of discrimination—including overdue race discrimination protections—to ensure that workers are not silenced and discrimination is not swept under the rug.”&lt;/p&gt;
