    <title>League of Legends’ 2022 world championship will be a multi-city affair</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="LA3yoK"&gt;One of the biggest esports events in the world will be spread across four North American cities next year. Riot Games has announced that the 2022 edition of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; World Championship will take place in New York, Toronto, Mexico City, and San Francisco. The announcement was made ahead of an NBA match between the Warriors and Raptors at the Chase Center in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQKK9E"&gt;Riot says this will be the first-ever multi-country edition of its annual competition; it’s also the first to take place in North America since 2016. Things will start out with the play-ins portion of the event in Mexico City (the Liga Latinoamerica competition arena), followed by the group stage and quarterfinals in New York (the Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden), semifinals in Toronto (Scotiabank Arena), and culminating with the finals in San Francisco (Chase Center). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXNAjR"&gt;The 2021 edition of Worlds just wrapped up earlier this month in Reykjavík, Iceland, after originally being planned for Shenzen, China. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;The competition moved countries due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.) The month-long tournament featured no fans in attendance, as underdog Edward Gaming topped defending champions DWG KIA, though it seems Riot is expecting that to change in 2022, given its plans to host matches in large NBA arenas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49AkVT"&gt;“We’re thrilled to bring the full scale of our global sport back to North America, and, COVID permitting, welcome fans into the stands across three countries and four different cities,” Naz Aletaha, global head of LoL Esports, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gT4HIa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bobby Kotick is still the CEO of Activision Blizzard, for now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tnvn7Fjx7HRR1mI6xo8LdmdODjk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70175270/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bKvmgu"&gt;Bobby Kotick is still the CEO of Activision Blizzard, despite a&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-tells-colleagues-he-would-consider-leaving-if-he-cant-quickly-fix-problems-11637533064"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;that detailed Kotick’s history of harassment and abusive behavior&lt;/a&gt; while also saying he knew about allegations and incidents of abuse within the company for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5BSYgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The WSJ claims that some employees asked in meetings if Kotick would step down&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kZNfDU"&gt;Kotick has reportedly told executives that he may consider stepping down if the company can’t fix its toxic work environment “with speed,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-tells-colleagues-he-would-consider-leaving-if-he-cant-quickly-fix-problems-11637533064"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sources close to the situation told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that Kotick met with Activision Publishing and Blizzard Entertainment leaders last week. His status as CEO was addressed, as executives said some employees won’t “be satisfied” until Kotick hands in his resignation. During the meeting, Kotick allegedly expressed regret for his past behavior and his handling of the harassment that went on during his 30-year reign of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbaKyX"&gt;The report also claims that employees attended meetings held by the company’s senior leaders and human resource managers last week and inquired whether Activision Blizzard’s zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment would apply to Kotick. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; also claims that some attendees directly asked if Kotick would step down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huWgp8"&gt;Activision is also weighing a “workplace excellence committee,” according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in response to allegations of a toxic work environment. The committee will supposedly help better Activision Blizzard’s work culture, but the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; claims that the company still has no specific plans to investigate Kotick’s behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fhQDPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Former Blizzard president J. Allen Brack left in August&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBdTdj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;gaming giant’s board of directors expressed confidence&lt;/a&gt; in Kotick’s leadership last week even after finding out about his allegedly abusive behavior, noting that they are “confident in Bobby Kotick’s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/playstation-chief-criticizes-activision-response-to-allegations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that PlayStation boss Jim Ryan told employees, “We do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; also reported Xbox head Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/xbox-chief-says-he-s-evaluating-relationship-with-activision?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told his teams&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUKrSF"&gt;Activision Blizzard has been embroiled in controversy since July &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;when &lt;/a&gt;the state of California sued it for a culture of “constant sexual harassment,” among many other troubling issues. Since then, employees have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;walked out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22786117/activision-blizzard-walk-out-bobby-kotick-resignation-demands"&gt;twice&lt;/a&gt;, and more than 1,500 employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;signed a petition to remove Kotick&lt;/a&gt;. Numerous key figures, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;including former Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, have left the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkwUeW"&gt;In July, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Kotick published a letter&lt;/a&gt; explaining that he and the company were “committed to long-lasting change,” though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;employees later stated&lt;/a&gt; that the message failed “ to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns,” including issues like forced arbitration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750450/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-bobby-kotick-paycut"&gt;which finally ended last month&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9AFbP"&gt;More recently, Blizzard co-lead Jen Oneal, who took on the role as the studio’s leadership shifted in the wake of the lawsuit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;stepped down after only three months&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, Oneal was paid less than her male counterpart and wrote in an email to the company’s legal team that she had been “tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against.” Oneal told employees that Activision Blizzard only offered her equal pay after she had tendered her resignation, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-jen-oneal-mike-ybarra-equal-pay-after-resignation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s play button stops shuffling, apparently because Adele said so</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CBS’s Coverage of Adele - One Night Only" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mnOLiVpOiQWnWHcByQjXyWk6AHk=/0x0:4135x2757/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70174328/1236478389.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cliff Lipson/CBS via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NNH2gE"&gt;Spotify has stopped shuffling albums by default following a request from Adele, according to a report by &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-59365019"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, when viewing an album on Spotify, you’d see a small shuffle icon within the larger “Play” button. This indicated that Spotify would begin playing the album’s songs in a random order, which isn’t always what users would expect (or want) it to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oDfYG"&gt;Now, when you hit “Play” in Album View, songs will play in order — that is, as long as you have a Premium subscription. You can still enable shuffle mode by toggling on the “Shuffle” icon when viewing an individual track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TWzGF5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This was the only request I had in our ever changing industry! We don’t create albums with so much care and thought into our track listing for no reason. Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended. Thank you Spotify for listening  ♥️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/XWlykhqxAy"&gt;https://t.co/XWlykhqxAy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Adele (@Adele) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Adele/status/1462260324485242881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1fzi6T"&gt;Adele appears to have asked Spotify to change this feature, citing that albums should be listened to in a specific order. The singer sent out a tweet to thank Spotify for making the change, noting that “Our art tells a story and our stories should be listened to as we intended. Thank you Spotify for listening.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Spotify/status/1462273326722605060?"&gt;Spotify later replied&lt;/a&gt; to Adele’s tweet, saying “Anything for you,” suggesting the move was done as a favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWSrzM"&gt;Chris Macowski, the head of music communications at Spotify, confirmed the presence of the new feature to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “As Adele mentioned, we are excited to share that we have begun rolling out a new Premium feature that has been long requested by both users and artists to make play the default button on all albums,” the spokesperson said. “For those users still wishing to shuffle an album, they can go to the Now Playing View and select the shuffle toggle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfDA3i"&gt;It’s no coincidence that the change comes just days after the release of Adele’s new album, &lt;em&gt;30&lt;/em&gt;, which has already exploded in popularity. One song, &lt;em&gt;Easy on Me&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://people.com/music/adele-easy-on-me-breaks-spotify-single-day-stream-record/"&gt;holds the Spotify record for the most global listens in a single day&lt;/a&gt;, kicking k-pop group BTS off of their throne.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Expanse, Ozark, Encounter, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJ65yNmIU8gShTfUdsp4cfth9zw=/344x0:1534x793/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70174186/theexpanse.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZjBQ7V"&gt;Welp, &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; season two finale was a messy disappointment much like the rest of the season. I think&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/19/1056800768/the-morning-show-finale-recap-sweating-it-out-with-americas-sweetheart"&gt; Linda Holmes’ recap at NPR&lt;/a&gt; really nailed why a season that seemed full of promise never hit the mark, mostly because it couldn’t quite figure out what it wanted to be. The latest season of &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; has yet to steer me wrong, however(and we learned this week that there is a fun &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dcseifert/status/1461807144244858886"&gt;Verge-related &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; backstory&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnIR9y"&gt;This week’s round up is heavy on the sci-fi, which was unplanned but makes for some nice symmetry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KXdcol"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fb01ds-4IC4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TnqMNd"&gt;The Expanse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uS95qr"&gt;The sixth and final season of the sci-fi drama is on the horizon, and is a disappointingly short six episodes. It has a lot of work to do and from the looks of the trailer, wastes no time getting down to business, and the episodes must be jam packed judging by the official synopsis: “Holden and the crew of the Rocinante fight alongside the Combined Fleet of Earth and Mars to protect the Inner Planets from Marco Inaros and his Free Navy’s campaign of death and destruction. Meanwhile, on a distant planet beyond the Rings, a new power rises.” Oooh. &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt; returns to Amazon Prime Video December 10th, with new episodes weekly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bb2UYo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8QwwWnLboU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5LllR4"&gt;Ozark &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7tn0Pw"&gt;I’m admittedly about a season behind on the Byrde family saga, so will need to catch up before season 4 drops. This full trailer runs in reverse, from a terrible car crash, back through highlights (lowlights?) of all three seasons of &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; to the show’s beginning. “Human beings make decisions, they commit acts, and that makes things happen. It creates a snowball effect, causes other people to make decisions. The cycle continues and the snowball keeps rolling,” Marty Byrde tells us in a voiceover. Uplifting as ever, this show. The words “no ending is reached by accident” appear over scenes of explosions, shootings, and all manner of violence, until it closes on the Byrde family driving along in their minivan looking happy. Ha we know &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;that &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;can’t last.&lt;em&gt; Ozark &lt;/em&gt;season 4 comes to Netflix on January 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hYKfVZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spider-Man: No Way Home’s latest trailer brings back all the bad guys","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22783510/spider-man-no-way-home-trailer-tom-holland-peter-parker-doctor-strange-villians"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="IfuLjX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SB44bZVe-c4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3Xlt6v"&gt;Encounter &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XAgU0J"&gt;Riz Ahmed is a “decorated Marine [who] goes on a rescue mission to save his two young sons from an unhuman threat,” according to the official synopsis. There is something weird swimming around in the one dude’s eyeball that makes Ahmed’s character freak out, there are bugs crawling and flying around everywhere that make him freak out, and all clues point to some kind of alien invasion (probably). Octavia Spencer stars along with Ahmed, Lucian-River Chauhan, and Aditya Geddada in &lt;em&gt;Encounter&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters December 3rd and Amazon Prime Video on December 10th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kfEt32"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q81Yf46Oj3s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Nvn0DW"&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V4hCYy"&gt;We got a teaser for this latest Guillermo del Toro movie in September, but get a fuller look at Bradley Cooper’s mysterious and somewhat menacing carny who can apparently read minds (or believes he can) under the right circumstances. Based on the 1946 novel by William Lindsay Gresham, &lt;em&gt;Nightmare Alley&lt;/em&gt; stars Cooper, Cate Blanchett, Toni Collette, Willem Dafoe, Richard Jenkins, Rooney Mara, Ron Perlman, and David Straithairn, and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;comes to theaters December 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zIw9qa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbIxYm3mKzI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JtTOdp"&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="OjQn18"&gt;This star-studded sci-fi dark comedy (it’s a thing) features Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as two relatively unknown astronomers who discover a planet-killing comet is headed toward Earth, but get blown off by everyone they try to warn— the president (Meryl Streep), her adviser (Jonah Hill), morning show hosts (Tyler Perry and Cate Blanchett), and pretty much everyone else. Timothee Chalamet, Ariana Grande, Rob Morgan, Ron Perlman, and Mark Rylance also star in &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look U&lt;/em&gt;p, which comes to Netflix on December 24th after a limited run in theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RfmpXH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQL0mB"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="h6wYaG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Messenger and Instagram may not get default end-to-end encryption until 2023</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SDCpU"&gt;Meta — Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp’s parent company — doesn’t plan to roll out end-to-end encryption (E2EE) by default on Messenger and Instagram until 2023, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/21/meta-delays-encrypted-messages-on-facebook-and-instagram-to-2023"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97FFot"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21369737/facebook-merging-instagram-messenger-chats-update"&gt;merged Messenger and Instagram chats&lt;/a&gt; last year, as a part of its plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18197228/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-merge-messaging-services-mark-zuckerberg"&gt;create a unified messaging system&lt;/a&gt; across all of its platforms. And while messages sent through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/4/13161224/facebook-messenger-encryption-privacy-enable"&gt;Messenger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://help.instagram.com/1165835007222763/How+do+I+start+an+end-to-end+encrypted+chat+on+Instagram%3F/"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt; can be E2EE, that option isn’t turned on by default — and likely won’t be — until sometime in 2023. WhatsApp already supports E2EE by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Evin0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta wants to keep users safe while still “assisting public safety efforts”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u9Rv28"&gt;In a post in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2021%2F11%2F20%2Fpeople-shouldnt-have-choose-privacy-safety-says-facebook-safety%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F21%2F22794622%2Fmessenger-instagram-end-to-end-encryption-default-2023" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Antigone Davis, Meta’s head of safety, attributes the delay to concerns about user safety. Since E2EE means only the sender and recipient will see their conversations, Davis says Meta wants to ensure that this doesn’t interfere with the platform’s ability to help stop criminal activity. Once E2EE does become available by default, Davis notes that the company will “use a combination of non-encrypted data across our apps, account information and reports from users” to help keep them safe, all while “assisting public safety efforts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJrpJM"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/messenger-policy-workshop-future-of-private-messaging/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, Meta said that default E2EE would become available on Instagram and Messenger “sometime in 2022 at the earliest.” But now, Davis says that Meta wants to “get this right,” so the company plans on delaying the feature’s debut until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg6Hx1"&gt;Also going into effect in 2023 is the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/12/uk-publishes-draft-online-safety-bill/"&gt;UK’s Online Safety bill&lt;/a&gt;, which will require online platforms to keep children from harm, as well as promptly address abusive content. This may impede Facebook’s plans to enable E2EE by default, as the UK’s Home Secretary, Priti Patel, has criticized its use in the past. According to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56795852"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;, Patel claims E2EE could make it more difficult to prevent child abuse online, stating: “Sadly, at a time when we need to be taking more action... Facebook is still pursuing E2EE plans that place the good work and the progress that has already been made at jeopardy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2THm0"&gt;Last year, the US joined the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, and Japan in a call to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/12/21513212/backdoor-encryption-access-us-canada-australia-new-zealand-uk-india-japan"&gt;give local law enforcement backdoor encryption access&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow authorities to view encrypted messages and files if a warrant is issued.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked Resident Evil 4 VR video suggests free Mercenaries DLC will arrive in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o9WAIe1OjQpnde1yhki3eyfgZF8=/40x0:1405x910/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70173691/Screen_Shot_2021_04_15_at_6.52.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iRZ0t0"&gt;A leaked video suggests that &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4 VR&lt;/em&gt; may be getting a free update that adds &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode in 2022, first spotted by &lt;a href="https://biohazardcast.com/the-mercenaries-resident-evil-4-vr-coming-2022/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Biohazard Declassified&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/resident-evil-4-vr-mercenaries-mode-confirmed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YxrTfC"&gt;According to the report, a trailer for the highly-requested &lt;em&gt;Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode briefly appeared on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/oculusvr"&gt;Oculus YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; before getting taken down. However, users still managed to save the trailer and repost it on YouTube. The leaked trailer says that &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; DLC is “arriving in 2022” as a “free update on Meta Quest 2.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6bsUB"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qcs0nw/mercenaries_would_add_a_lot_of_replayability_to/"&gt;fans of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OculusQuest/comments/qc8ar6/resident_evil_4_vr_will_not_have_mercenaries_mode/"&gt;the series&lt;/a&gt; were disappointed to find out that &lt;em&gt;Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; wasn’t included in &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;, which challenges you to kill hordes of enemies and rack up as many points as possible before the timer runs out. As &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; notes, &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt; mode has been present in all versions of &lt;em&gt;RE4 — &lt;/em&gt;except for &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;. You could also find the mode in &lt;em&gt;RE3: Nemesis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE5&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE6&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;RE Village&lt;/em&gt;, and in its own spinoff &lt;em&gt;RE: The Mercenaries 3D&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DdiKAS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 will soon be known as the Meta Quest 2&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vF0kIJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22692268/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;RE4&lt;/em&gt;VR came out on the Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt; last month without the add-ons that the game came with in the past, including &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Separate Ways&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Assignment: Ada&lt;/em&gt;. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review"&gt;review of the &lt;em&gt;RE4VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; gives you a better look at how the base game plays, which turned out to be better than we thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnEeC7"&gt;As you can also see from the leaked trailer, Facebook (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22749919/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-meta-company-rebrand"&gt;which now belongs to Meta&lt;/a&gt;), has replaced the “Oculus Quest 2” with its revamped name and logo, calling it the “Meta Quest 2.” The rebranding has even seeped to the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus website&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll see Meta’s name and logo stamped in the top left corner of the screen (via &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-brand-dead-oculus-quest-to-become-meta-quest/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751220/facebook-portal-oculus-quest-meta-horizon-renaming"&gt;Meta plans on phasing out Oculus branding&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, just in time for &lt;em&gt;The Mercenaries&lt;/em&gt;’ potential release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egnmdb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction November 21st, 4:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that &lt;/em&gt;UploadVR&lt;em&gt; first broke the news about the trailer, when it was actually &lt;/em&gt;Biohazard Declassified&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Reddit helped keep the Cowboy Bebop community alive </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzdMLbKio0tX2ifpm9b70eFQ9vA=/0x3:1504x1006/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70173647/CBP_e001_0239_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sum27A"&gt;In recent years, Netflix has started to specialize in live-action adaptations of anime. So far, the streaming service has released film adaptations such as &lt;em&gt;Death Note&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fullmetal Alchemist&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rurouni Kenshin&lt;/em&gt;. The next anime to receive the live-action treatment is &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;, a show considered to be one of the greatest anime ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1y4Zp"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; anime ended in 2001, but it’s seeing a surge in popularity thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22776962/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix"&gt;the new Netflix show&lt;/a&gt;. That popularity can be seen on Reddit in the r/cowboybebop subreddit. For nearly a decade, fans have flocked to this community to post their thoughts on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/mz1owa/spike_spiegel_seeing_his_past_with_his_left_eye/"&gt;Spike Spiegel and his past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/lg2w9a/best_dub_ever/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;funny memes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/qn2tfx/my_faye_valentine_cosplay/"&gt;cosplay pics&lt;/a&gt;, and fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cowboybebop/comments/qo78te/some_fan_art_i_drew/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;fan art&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JenAyb"&gt;“I created the subreddit in 2012, so a little over nine years now,” said MarshallBanana_, head moderator and creator of the subreddit. MarshallBanana_ became a fan during the series’ original run on Adult Swim. Anime gained popularity in America during the 1990s and the 2000s with the introduction of Toonami and Adult Swim, programming blocks on Cartoon Network dedicated to airing anime and mature shows. The first anime to ever air on Adult Swim was &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8L8xZL"&gt;The show made its debut on September 2nd, 2001, one day after the first broadcast of Adult Swim. It followed the adventures of Spike Spiegel, Jett Black, and Faye Valentine, bounty hunters who travel the galaxy searching for their targets. It only had 26 episodes and a movie but managed to maintain a huge online fanbase in the two decades following its release, thanks to communities like r/cowboybebop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BfD0R5"&gt;Both the community, and the show it’s based on, have been able to reach and connect fans across the world. That includes one of the subreddit’s own moderators. Alwaqas is from the Middle East and joined the subreddit two years ago but has been a fan of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; since he was a kid. “Being from the Middle East, the anime that I watched as a kid were very different than what is popular in the US. One day, the&lt;em&gt; Bebop&lt;/em&gt; movie came up on TV, and I had heard about &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; before but never seen it; it was so different from what I have seen before, and I instantly got hooked.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZYc3_uLRXUHX5DU_KrsKsXx3JBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027107/CBP_e008_0120.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sunrise Entertainment&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HVVW6H"&gt;The show pulls from so many influences that it’s able to attract an international audience. “I think that the unique way that &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; blends genres while still being so consistent lets it feel so fresh to this day,” Alwaqas says. “It is still a really relevant show with a quality of animation that is still unmatched to this day.” SonicFrost, another moderator of the subreddit, explains that [it] has simply become necessary viewing for any prospective anime viewer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsAnH9"&gt;Currently, the member count of r/cowboybebop sits at 225,000, but this was not always the case. “In 2018, the sub was barely stepping above 20,000 subs; it was pretty much dead at that point,” said -WakaJawaka-, one of the subreddit’s other moderators. These numbers improved after some of the mods attempted to revitalize the community, led by -WakaJawaka- and MarshallBanana_.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZMiwUA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty much dead at that point”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c3gVVY"&gt;“I think after I joined, we tried to give it some life again with some small redesign, a new series rewatch discussion, and creating our Discord server, which gave a new breath of life into the community,” said -WakaJawaka-. The community’s members grew to 50,000 in 2019, likely thanks to these changes by the mods. SonicFrost believes that the community’s current growth has been sparked by the Netflix series. “Generally, I think that the fanbase will continue to grow just off the back of the original show,” he says. “But without a doubt, the announcement of the live-action show has had a significant effect on our subreddit, and we’re quite excited to see it breathe new life to it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPdPID"&gt;Users of r/cowboybebop have different theories. No_Mathematician2251 believes that YouTube video essays are the cause for this growth, while NChamars believes the answer is much simpler: the show is popular. “It’s because the series is gaining its spot in mainstream culture and over the years has been getting more attention. That’s why Netflix wants to create a live-action show.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="cowboy bebop" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nzmt7VvTK0c4-pjfPdXaVM8xUDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006585/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Geoffrey Short / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n314qk"&gt;MarshallBanana_ is optimistic about the Netflix series but does admit there’s been negativity surrounding it. “Lately, a good portion of the community has allowed for their more negative side to come out, as they feel very protective of the anime, and sometimes it bums me out that more people aren’t open-minded about the adaptation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7zKj1"&gt;With the Netflix show being a subject of controversy, criticism was always bound to happen. The negative commentary hasn’t been too common on the subreddit, stemming mostly from a vocal minority, but it has still been disappointing for SonicFrost. “It’s frustrating to see people who actively attempt to undermine and disqualify other people’s joy — as though their subjective feelings are objectively wrong. Isn’t that strange?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gI6UGX"&gt;He also wants to give this vocal minority and all of the subreddit’s users a space to debate each other. “Our hope is both can find a voice on our platform, without resorting to tired insults and attacks on each other or on the cast and crew, who I’m certain have poured their heart and soul into this thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UnjJEt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is such a warm and welcoming community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDXm9G"&gt;These conversations between users are among MarshallBanana_’s favorite aspects of the community. “For the most part, the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; community is filled with talented, kind, intelligent people. There’s always an enlightening conversation to be had and fan art projects and cosplay to admire.” For Alwaqas, his favorite aspect is how welcoming the community is. “It is such a warm and welcoming community; like every community, it has gatekeepers and not so nice members, but I never felt so welcomed in such a fanbase like the &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; fanbase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4lGG9"&gt;After the Netflix show debuts, the subreddit will no doubt grow larger, meaning even more people will get to experience how this welcoming feeling. As for the community’s future, MarshallBanana_ thinks that the Netflix show will be the topic of conversation for a while. But when that passes, he has a few things in mind. “My personal goal is to keep the community civil and peaceful, have good conversations, and hopefully get some AMAs with people who worked on both shows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ifOQP"&gt;The other mods echoed the same sentiment. There seems to be an expectation that the Netflix show will bring in new users. SonicFrost knows this, but he hopes that the series is actually good. “Netflix really has the opportunity here to reinvigorate this fandom — and maybe finally show that a ‘Netflix anime adaptation’ isn’t a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZB4STW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s early Black Friday deals on games and consoles have begun</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ykzben2yN8aOyP3FXzVopn-nsOQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70111479/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pwlpf2"&gt;Nintendo’s early &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals kicked off on Sunday, November 21st, and they’ll last until November 27th. Like last year, the main attraction is the standard Nintendo Switch console that includes &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe &lt;/em&gt;and a three-month individual membership to Nintendo Switch Online. It all costs $299.99. Nintendo confirmed that the Switch console included here is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;the V2 model&lt;/a&gt; with improved battery life. Altogether, these items would cost around $370, so the $299 price point is stellar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zh9EHs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10878364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zr5KG5"&gt;Several games are seeing big discounts, including ones that don’t commonly see such a big price drop. GameStop is hosting the best deals of any retailer right now (plus, these are the lowest prices of all time for these titles) on new physical editions of games, and notably, their digital editions, too. To make it easier to view and shop, I’m just going to list them below with their best sale prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDJbdv"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oculus Quest 2 comes with a free $50 gift card through Saturday</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcCmK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset&lt;/a&gt; is a great value at its regular $299.99 price. It comes with 128GB of onboard storage, and once you log in with your Facebook account, there’s little else standing in your way of finding some amazing virtual reality experiences and games. It’s even more of an appealing holiday gift idea right now because you can get one with a $50 gift card tossed in at no extra charge through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; until Saturday, November 27th. Several retailers are honoring this promotion, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2XJSUmC5J" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ/r?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (enter &lt;strong&gt;OCULUS50 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout), &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2-standalone%2Fp%2FN82E16826910033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/oculus-quest-2-all-in-one-vr-headset---256-gb-with-quest-2-carrying-case.product.100797536.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Foculus-quest-2-advanced-all-in-one-virtual-reality-headset-128gb%2F-%2FA-83984421%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeOculusBFDeal11212021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt; itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKJoid"&gt;This deal extends to the $399.99 headset that doubles the storage to 256GB, which includes a $50 gift card as well. Just note that you’ll earn a gift card to the retailer where you purchased the Oculus Quest 2, unless you buy it from Oculus directly. In that case, you’ll get $50 of credit to use on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;games purchased digitally&lt;/a&gt; through the Oculus Store. If you’re a fan of creepy first-person shooters, I highly suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ux7Typ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyqXUu"&gt;You’re welcome to use your gift card however you like, but if you’re open to suggestions, I’d use it on either &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus’ tough, zip-up case for the headset&lt;/a&gt; and its controllers, or its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite Strap that makes the Quest 2 much more comfortable to wear&lt;/a&gt;. Each cost $50, so choose wisely (or get both, knowing that you’re spending only half as much as you would have normally to kit out your new headset).&lt;/p&gt;

    <updated>2021-11-20T18:20:50-05:00</updated>
    <title>A new DuckDuckGo tool is supposed to prevent apps from tracking Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DPRHP37oS5vcRbmihmQLOkLtXM4=/184x0:2161x1318/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70171701/duckduckgo_app_tracking.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="762Atb"&gt;DuckDuckGo’s new tool aims to prevent apps from tracking Android users, first reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/duckduckgo-android-app-tracking-block/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The tool, called App Tracking Protection, hopes to offer more protection from third-party trackers than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;Apple’s App Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt;, which gives users the choice to opt-out of data tracking within apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8duzu"&gt;However, DuckDuckGo’s tool hasn’t been rolled out as part of an update to all Android phones, nor is it available as a separate download — it’s built into DuckDuckGo’s privacy-focused browser app, but works across your device. In a &lt;a href="https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-app-tracking-protection/"&gt;post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that the tool will block “trackers it identifies in other apps from third-party companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1eZ0-ZlUAYOK-PB43Nuf_MScRJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23030713/duckduckgo_block_app_tracking.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by DuckDuckGo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gA8E6R"&gt;Once App Tracking Protection is enabled, it will run in the background as you use your phone. The tool recognizes when an app is about to send data to a third-party tracker, and will then prevent the app from taking your information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78K8s2"&gt;DuckDuckGo says that it’s “continually working to identify and protect against new trackers,” which means that your data should be kept away from any new trackers that crop up. From the DuckDuckGo app, you should also be able to see a real-time view of trackers that the tool has blocked, along with where your data would’ve been going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp0jfQ"&gt;The company says that although its App Tracking Protection tool isn’t a virtual private network (VPN), your device will behave as if it is one. “This is because App Tracking Protection uses a local ‘VPN connection’ which means that it works its magic right on your smartphone,” DuckDuckGo explains in its post. “However, App Tracking Protection is different from VPNs because it never routes app data through an external server.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TZuzRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More than 96 percent of the most popular free Android apps have third-party trackers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tbLLox"&gt;While conducting its own test, DuckDuckGo found that more than 96 percent of some of the most popular free Android apps have third-party trackers that most users are unaware of. The company also discovered that 87 percent of these apps send user data to Google, while 68 percent send data to Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoEZ8o"&gt;Right now the tool is in beta, but you can join the private waitlist (you won’t have to enter any personal information to do so). To sign up, download DuckDuckGo from the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android"&gt;Google Play Store&lt;/a&gt;, and open the app. Hit “Settings” followed by “App Tracking Protection” in the “Privacy Section.” From there, choose “Join the Private Waitlist.” DuckDuckGo says it's gradually introducing the feature to more people every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcpoME"&gt;As pointed out by &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, DuckDuckGo obviously doesn’t have the power to change the internal configuration of Android devices like Google does, which means that DuckDuckGo’s tool can’t provide the same app tracking permission prompts that appear on Android and iOS. But if you combine the App Tracking Protection tool and the privacy settings already in Android devices, you can help protect your data from third-party trackers and apps themselves. Like Apple, Google recently started making it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466531/google-android-ad-traking-advertising-identifier-id"&gt;more difficult for apps to collect data&lt;/a&gt; on users by restricting them from accessing users’ Advertising IDs after they’ve opted out of tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIAmfO"&gt;Apple’s stringent App Tracking Transparency tools essentially uproot the advertising system on iPhones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/31/22756135/apple-app-tracking-transparency-policy-snapchat-facebook-twitter-youtube-lose-10-billion"&gt;reportedly costing social platforms $10 billion&lt;/a&gt; as a result. But as a report by &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/23/iphone-tracking/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explains, Apple’s privacy system is limited, as it only blocks access to users’ Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROm2OP"&gt;Kamyl Bazbaz, the vice president of communications at DuckDuckGo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple’s App Tracking Transparency tool “only restricts direct access to a user’s IDFA, the rest is essentially an honor system, where Apple is asking developers to respect user choice not to track but isn’t actually blocking any third party trackers itself. App Tracking Protection blocks those third-party trackers directly, making the tool more powerful than what’s available on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tK3BPV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 21st, 9:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to clarify that DuckDuckGo’s tool can help provide more protection from third-party trackers when compared to Apple’s App Tracking Transparency tools and Android’s privacy settings alone. Also added a statement from a DuckDuckGo spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
