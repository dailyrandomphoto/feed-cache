    <title>Bumble’s new Night In feature is an attempt to break the ice on virtual dates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aMPb9_kf2lvnrCdwWybYJgsQmKM=/113x0:1807x1129/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949238/Night_In_Press_w_logo.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bumble&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xWxfjD"&gt;Dating app Bumble has announced Night In, a new feature that lets you play games on a virtual date. The feature is available to users in the US and Canada, and the game available at launch is a series of trivia questions you can answer together. However, Bumble says it plans to offer more games and virtual experiences in the “near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USOJAz"&gt;Night In is an expansion of Bumble’s existing video dates feature, which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19121374/bumble-dating-app-video-voice-chat-call-first-date"&gt;launched back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The feature has seen a marked increase in demand as a result of the pandemic; Bumble says its voice and video calling features were used 70 percent more after the pandemic started. Hopefully, being able to play a game will act as a nice icebreaker and help mitigate some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324221/tinder-bumble-video-virtual-dating-calls-feature-whyd-you-push-that-button-podcast"&gt;more awkward elements of virtual dates&lt;/a&gt;, even if they’ll never match the intimacy of being in the same room as another person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9mF730"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bumble added video dates in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j8MiuN"&gt;Bumble’s Night In can be organized using the icon in a chat message. The virtual date can be scheduled ahead of time for between 6PM and midnight on any day of the week. Once scheduled, both participants will be sent reminders and notifications by the app ahead of the date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlxYM"&gt;Bumble’s video chat features were in place before the pandemic, but other dating apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21316317/tinder-face-to-face-rollout-video-calls"&gt;Tinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21209801/hinge-video-call-chat-date-from-home-feature-launch"&gt;Hinge&lt;/a&gt; have had to rush to catch up over the past year. Although the introduction of these features was undoubtedly influenced by the pandemic, it sounds like they might live on after this current era of social distancing. In a recent survey, Bumble says almost half of respondents in the US said they preferred a first date to be virtual rather than in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qqj0KM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvQUYx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Maps will soon let you draw on a map to fix it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3m6HgJn1optvQNEvBo0G239qLD4=/349x33:2880x1720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949184/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.14.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFgh7D"&gt;If you’ve ever been frustrated by a road simply &lt;em&gt;not existing&lt;/em&gt; on Google Maps, the company’s now making it easier than ever to add it. Google will be updating its map editing experience to allow users to add missing roads and realign, rename or delete incorrect ones. It calls the experience “drawing,” but it’s closer to using the line tool in Microsoft Paint. The updated tool should be “rolling out over the coming months in more than 80 countries,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/maps/three-new-ways-anyone-can-update-google-maps/?_ga=2.110865477.1901867856.1615485216-809046695.1615485216"&gt;according to a blog post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYTXZ9"&gt;Currently, if you try to add a missing road, you can only drop a pin where the road should be and type in the road’s name to submit that information to Google. The new tool should make it easier to not only add missing roads, but to make corrections such as fixing a road’s name or its direction (for example, if the road is one-way but Google Maps says it isn’t).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eiqj_-8RcexSEqLoJYwumqUF1y0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361266/Google_Map_edit.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new map editor lets users visually add in missing roads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvcz9706AtSAqAifoTJUNShJvzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361359/Screen_Shot_2021_03_10_at_4.03.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current correction screen is more rudimentary.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GP5pNI"&gt;Of course, Google will still be vetting your corrections to make sure they’re accurate. After you submit a change with the new tool, you’ll see a screen where Google warns that it doesn’t want a bike path to be marked as a road, or for someone to make a road intended to hurt people, for example. That screen also says that it’ll take about seven days for the company to review your submission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJfd5n"&gt;Google Maps will also be getting a feature called “photo updates” which will let you share small details about a place without having to leave a full review. In the app, you’ll be able add images of a location as well as see recent photos with text snippets others have submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vUCJ34xkgfJ6ORb1AcAYh_Rwnfs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22361222/Photo_Updates_Hero_Image___Updates_Tab.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updates should help surface the most recent information about a location.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>GM aims to make its electric vehicles go farther and cost less with new battery partnership</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qOvO5X-dXZajLLZX7hh8lA82m3o=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949175/GMEVDay04.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Steve Fecht for General Motors&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MNygFL"&gt;General Motors announced a new joint venture with SolidEnergy Systems, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries. The two companies plan on building a test facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, for a high-capacity preproduction battery by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oiE7Y"&gt;The partnership was announced Thursday by GM president Mark Reuss at a &lt;em&gt;Washington Post Live&lt;/em&gt; virtual conference. Prior to the announcement, &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Kent Helfrich, executive director of GM’s global electrification and battery systems, about what the joint venture will mean for the automaker’s plans to electrify its entire fleet of vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wgwRqG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1LlWWx"&gt;“In the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost,” Helfrich said. “And it’ll also mean most likely smaller batteries, so a lighter weight vehicle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hbuEb"&gt;When GM first unveiled its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium battery platform&lt;/a&gt; last year, it said the new energy system would enable electric vehicles that could travel “400 miles or more” on a single charge. Last November, the automaker increased the estimated maximum range to 450 miles. The first vehicle to be built with an Ultium battery will be the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GMC Hummer EV&lt;/a&gt;, which the company says will have an estimated 350 miles of range. The Hummer is expected to go into production at the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gu7dBt"&gt;The company is sticking with its estimate of 450 miles of range for now, declining to speculate as to how many more miles it anticipates adding through its battery venture with SolidEnergy Systems. That company has been focused on improving the energy density in li-ion batteries for nearly a decade. According to MIT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="cSXyDW"&gt;Founded in 2012 by MIT alumnus and former postdoc Qichao Hu ’07, SolidEnergy Systems has developed an “anode-free” lithium metal battery with several material advances that make it twice as energy-dense, yet just as safe and long-lasting as the lithium ion batteries used in smartphones, electric cars, wearables, drones, and other devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="W1yPLC"&gt;GM is interested in the company’s intellectual property, which includes the manufacturing process for lithium metal anodes and electrolytes to improve the battery’s overall life cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="A8Eqle"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Anode-free” lithium metal battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ITodtK"&gt;Despite its name, SolidEnergy still works with liquid electrolytes and does not consider itself a “solid-state” battery company. Solid-state systems have been the subject of intense focus from the auto industry in recent years, as companies seek to develop EV batteries that will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKeT8o"&gt;While the focus of this joint venture with SolidEnergy is the production of “wet” li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes, GM is looking closely at solid-state technology for the future. “Is our advanced team also looking at solid state type technology? Absolutely,” Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology, said. “We wouldn’t leave anything off the table at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gwu9SE"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gm-batteries/gm-says-it-is-almost-there-on-million-mile-electric-vehicle-battery-idUSKBN22V2FS"&gt;a top GM official said&lt;/a&gt; the company was “almost there” on developing an electric vehicle battery that will last 1 million miles. Speaking to a group of investors, GM executive VP Doug Parks wouldn’t specify a timeline, but said “multiple teams” at the automaker are working on such advances as zero-cobalt electrodes, solid-state batteries, and ultra-fast charging. Typical EV batteries today last up to 100,000 to 200,000 miles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JtHD"&gt;GM has been an investor in SolidEnergy Systems since 2015 through its venture capital arm, but it isn’t the only battery startup to attract the automaker’s interest. In 2010, GM invested &lt;a href="https://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/09/g-m-ventures-invests-3-2-million-in-battery-company/"&gt;$3.2 million in a Michigan-based company called Sakti3&lt;/a&gt; that was working on solid-state batteries. The automaker is also in talks to construct a second massive battery factory in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhOLVD"&gt;But GM isn’t the only company to view advances in EV batteries as a way to accelerate the future in which zero-emission vehicles replace all of the gas-guzzling cars on the road today. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla announced&lt;/a&gt; its own plan to take more control over its battery-making process. And next week, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/09/vw-tesla-like-battery-day-produce-cells-spain/"&gt;Volkswagen will unveil its own vision&lt;/a&gt; for EV batteries during its virtual “Power Day” event. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story on how Facebook’s focus on growth stopped its AI team from fighting misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ISLUwsBpJSPwzNeuULDvD_FjH2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949135/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Th&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQpWBY"&gt;Facebook has always been a company focused on growth above all else. More users and more engagement equals more revenue. The cost of that single-mindedness is spelled out clearly in &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;this brilliant story from &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It details how attempts to tackle misinformation by the company’s AI team using machine learning were apparently stymied by Facebook’s unwillingness to limit user engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1LTzI"&gt;“If a model reduces engagement too much, it’s discarded. Otherwise, it’s deployed and continually monitored,” writes author Karen Hao of Facebook’s machine learning models. “But this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0DI9Ty"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ibchUl"&gt;On &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_KarenHao/status/1370008460918743045"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Hao noted that the article is not about “corrupt people [doing] corrupt things.” Instead, she says, “It’s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing. But they’re trapped in a rotten system, trying their best to push the status quo that won’t budge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hOURCQ"&gt;The story also adds more evidence to the accusation that Facebook’s desire to placate conservatives during Donald Trump’s presidency led to it turning a blind eye to right-wing misinformation. This seems to have happened at least in part due to the influence of Joel Kaplan, a former member of George W. Bush’s administration who is now Facebook’s vice president of global public policy and “its highest-ranking Republican.” As Hao writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tCJ6qq"&gt;All Facebook users have some 200 “traits” attached to their profile. These include various dimensions submitted by users or estimated by machine-learning models, such as race, political and religious leanings, socioeconomic class, and level of education. Kaplan’s team began using the traits to assemble custom user segments that reflected largely conservative interests: users who engaged with conservative content, groups, and pages, for example. Then they’d run special analyses to see how content-moderation decisions would affect posts from those segments, according to a former researcher whose work was subject to those reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYL5Hb"&gt;The Fairness Flow documentation, which the Responsible AI team wrote later, includes a case study on how to use the tool in such a situation. When deciding whether a misinformation model is fair with respect to political ideology, the team wrote, “fairness” does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; mean the model should affect conservative and liberal users equally. If conservatives are posting a greater fraction of misinformation, as judged by public consensus, then the model should flag a greater fraction of conservative content. If liberals are posting more misinformation, it should flag their content more often too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yQK6y"&gt;But members of Kaplan’s team followed exactly the opposite approach: they took “fairness” to mean that these models should not affect conservatives more than liberals. When a model did so, they would stop its deployment and demand a change. Once, they blocked a medical-misinformation detector that had noticeably reduced the reach of anti-vaccine campaigns, the former researcher told me. They told the researchers that the model could not be deployed until the team fixed this discrepancy. But that effectively made the model meaningless. “There’s no point, then,” the researcher says. A model modified in that way “would have literally no impact on the actual problem” of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjb9kb"&gt;The story also says that the work by Facebook’s AI researchers on the problem of algorithmic bias, in which machine learning models unintentionally discriminate against certain groups of users, has been undertaken, at least in part to preempt these same accusations of anti-conservative sentiment and forestall potential regulation by the US government. But pouring more resources into bias has meant ignoring problems involving misinformation and hate speech. Despite the company’s lip service to AI fairness, the guiding principle, says Hao, is still the same as ever: growth, growth, growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="MTBQnQ"&gt;[T]esting algorithms for fairness is still largely optional at Facebook. None of the teams that work directly on Facebook’s news feed, ad service, or other products are required to do it. Pay incentives are still tied to engagement and growth metrics. And while there are guidelines about which fairness definition to use in any given situation, they aren’t enforced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qSYdPq"&gt;You can read Hao’s full story at &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soon you’ll be able to buy a one-foot-tall figurine of ChilledCow’s lo-fi chill beats anime girl</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxUfn7EGMDU717v3Tygsh2d4J9w=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68949041/youtooz_lofi_hip_hop_radio_beats_to_relax_study_to_girl_1_ft_figure_release_info_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Youtooz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vo5o6O"&gt;Jesus. Okay. Look, I like capitalism as much as the next schmuck who blogs for a living, but what is going on right now with regard to the efficient allocation of the Earth’s precious resources?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1bFKK"&gt;Let me paint a word picture for you. Youtooz, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262329/stonks-vinyl-figurine-gamestop-dogecoin-reddit"&gt;the company that made a stonks guy figurine&lt;/a&gt;, has now created a one-foot-tall version of the lo-fi chill beats anime girl, complete with desk and study materials. You know her; she’s always studying while you’re listening to said beats. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2F2021%2F3%2Fyoutooz-lofi-hip-hop-radio-beats-to-relax-study-to-girl-1-ft-figure-release-info&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F3%2F11%2F22325348%2Fyoutooz-lofi-chill-anime-beats-chilled-cow-figurine" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the figurine drops for public consumption on April 2nd at 3PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9dpWHF"&gt;In theory, I like whatever’s going on here. Before it became something of a meme, lo-fi chill anime beats to work and study to was an inaccurate description of the post-Nujabes diaspora — you know, the stuff that Jun Seba did on &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo Music Record: Departure&lt;/em&gt;, the soundtrack to Shinichirō Watanabe’s brilliant anime. Whatever happened between 2004 (when the TV show and the record were released) and now must have been pretty traumatic; the sound wended its way through innumerable producers and turned into something like Muzak — &lt;a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/28274/muzak-history-background-story-background-music"&gt;music to be productive to&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5pNDT"&gt;Anyway, we’re in the deep end now. Over on YouTube, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"&gt;ChilledCow&lt;/a&gt; is probably the most recognizable channel for lo-fi goodness, streaming as they do to tens of thousands of listeners at any given minute on any given day. And yes, Youtooz’s figurine is a replica of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perpetually studying anime girl. It looks cool; she has a backpack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMOpdN"&gt;But that still doesn’t answer my question. I guess it doesn’t matter? I do love the statuette, but I’m not sure it needs to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Najtpq"&gt;Whatever. Do Canti from &lt;em&gt;FLCL&lt;/em&gt; next, cowards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taser maker Axon teams up with Skydio to sell drones directly to cops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YlTIIslun73Iygb2cv7xvC1aEPs=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948975/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xayVO3"&gt;Axon — the law enforcement company that makes Tasers, police body cameras, and other police and military technologies — has announced a new partnership with US drone company Skydio. Through the new deal, Axon will become the exclusive provider of Skydio’s drones (like the Skydio 2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;X2&lt;/a&gt;) to law enforcement and police agencies, while Skydio will be able to offer Axon’s drone-based software tools, &lt;a href="https://www.axon.com/products/axon-evidence"&gt;like Axon Evidence&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.axon.com/products/respond"&gt;Axon Respond&lt;/a&gt; on its drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBcczl"&gt;Both tools are largely observational in nature, so they wouldn’t be turning the drones into weapons. Axon Evidence is used to compile footage, similar to how Axon’s existing body cameras work, so that the drones can offer additional perspectives on a situation. Axon itself explicitly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761084/axon-taser-facial-recognition-ban-ethics-board-recommendation"&gt;announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that it won’t be “commercializing face matching products.” Similarly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;Skydio’s CEO has previously&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it won’t be weaponizing its products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rakNJM"&gt;Skydio itself already sells drones to police departments, too — the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22156987/go-read-this-police-drones-skydio-dji-privacy"&gt;Chula Vista, California police department&lt;/a&gt; is already a customer, for example, complete with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21505064/faa-visual-line-of-sight-skydio-2-waiver-ncdot-chula-vista"&gt;limited FAA approval&lt;/a&gt; to use those drones beyond visual line of sight in emergency situations. But the Axon deal opens the door to make it much easier for departments to buy Skydio’s products in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l0IbCy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Autonomous drone maker Skydio shifts to military and enterprise with its first folding drone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MGr4B3"&gt;The Skydio deal isn’t Axon’s first drone partnership; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/5/17429908/dji-axon-air-taser-drones-police-officers-program-sale"&gt;back in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, it launched its “&lt;a href="https://global.axon.com/products/air"&gt;Axon Air&lt;/a&gt;” program in partnership with DJI, offering Axon software on DJI drones sold directly by Axon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gX4h9o"&gt;But in the years since, DJI’s Chinese ties have effectively sidelined it from US government work. DJI is headquartered in Shenzhen and its drones are largely made in China with Chinese parts, leading some officials to worry that DJI drones could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack by the Chinese government. The Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded its DJI fleet&lt;/a&gt; in October 2019 over security concerns from spying or cyberattacks. The Department of Justice banned the purchase of foreign-made drones &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/520269-justice-department-issues-policy-banning-use-of-grant-funds-for-certain"&gt;with agency funds last October&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;Department of Defense’s list of approved drones&lt;/a&gt; only includes products from Skydio, Parrot, and Vantage, with DJI notably absent from the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIYuQD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;DJI was also recently added&lt;/a&gt; to the US Department of Commerce’s Entity List, which aimed to sanction DJI for enabling “wide-scale human rights abuses within China,” when the &lt;a href="https://api.narrativ.com/api/v0/redirect/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Ffeatures%2F2020-03-26%2Fdji-s-drone-supremacy-comes-at-a-price%3Fsrnd%3Deconomics-vp%26sref%3DExbtjcSG&amp;amp;a=1722098870466579501&amp;amp;uuid=0129be77-04d4-4fff-93e3-0a2eea64f11f&amp;amp;uid_bam=1720778310608519800&amp;amp;ar=1726904878611144427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company provided drones&lt;/a&gt; to the Chinese government to surveil detention camps in the Xinjiang province. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5S24DB"&gt;And while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;DJI is still able to sell its drones&lt;/a&gt; in the US to consumers, Skydio in particular has already managed to capitalize on the government’s blacklist of Chinese drone companies, and it recently became the first US drone company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;to reach a $1 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajGzJH"&gt;Skydio CEO Adam Bry &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21323448/skydio-x2-consumer-military-enterprise-ceo-adam-bry"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt; that it still intends to stay in the consumer drone business and that it won’t be arming its drones. “We have more products coming in that market that we’re excited about,” said Bry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQFi9l"&gt;But government and military deals are unquestionably a big part of Skydio’s plans. Last year, the company debuted the Skydio X2 (an exclusively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322832/skydio-x2-commercial-drone-enterprise-military-announce-100-million-funding"&gt;military and enterprise-focused drone&lt;/a&gt; that will be one of the models sold by Axon). Skydio also already has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com./story/drone-maker-swooping-us-pushback-against-dji/"&gt;existing deals&lt;/a&gt; with the Air Force and DEA and is undergoing assessment by the US Army to be part of the &lt;a href="https://dronedj.com/2021/02/10/skydio-x2d-might-wind-up-being-used-by-the-us-army-in-some-capacity/"&gt;Short Range Reconnaissance Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uwJp9G"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 11th, 11:45am: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional details on Skydio’s existing police customers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s Liberty Air 2 Pro pair good noise cancellation with a low price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;And they have a surprisingly great app&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="7fJcCf"&gt;It is increasingly hard to stand out in the wireless earbud market. You can find a pair of earbuds at nearly every price point with a range of different features sprinkled throughout. Being within a particular ecosystem, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/20/14016568/apple-airpods-wireless-earpods-earbuds-review"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; for iOS users or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; for Samsung’s users, is an easy way to choose earbuds that are right for you. Anker doesn’t exactly have a phone of its own to sell alongside its Liberty line of earbuds, so its strategy is to deliver desirable features at a competitive price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4Ac12"&gt;The $129.99 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro buds do a lot of things well, but so do a lot of other earbuds at this price. It’s their competitive active noise cancellation and well-designed app that helps them stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="feEcgh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10384906"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5G7GX"&gt;The buds themselves are the same stemmed design with a silicone ear tip as Apple’s AirPods Pro. (I guess the name isn’t the only way Anker took inspiration from Apple.) The Liberty Air 2 Pro have a gold fan-like cover over their speakers, which serves no purpose other than looking cool, and a textured, matte finish. They come in “onyx black,” “titanium white,” “sapphire blue,” and “crystal pink.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Included in the box are nine different-sized silicone ear tips, ranging from XXXS to XL, to create the best seal and hopefully keep movement in your ear canal from happening.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-QTMx4yAhUIVNaIOUtXxWNLXVPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360983/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro come in black, white, blue, and pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xhzWgb"&gt;Fit is extremely important in earbuds, not only for ANC but also for the best sound quality experience, especially in the lower frequencies. To confirm you have chosen the best-sized tips, Anker has a Tip Fit Test within the Soundcore app.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The app plays about 10 seconds of ringtone-esque orchestral music, then displays a “good seal” or “bad seal” result for each earbud. (Yes, it’s basically just like what Apple does with the AirPods Pro. Inspiration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtfrn"&gt;There is also an audio test called HearID that claims to map your personal hearing sensitivity at multiple frequencies to best tailor the EQ settings for you.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It plays about 30 different tones per ear and asks you to confirm if you can hear the tone or not.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Next, you are presented with a graph of your results and an EQ preset saved to the app. My test resulted in deep bass and less treble, which did make my music sound fuller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qt2KWn"&gt;Both the fit tests and EQ settings test are something several other earbud makers are doing these days, and although not everyone finds these tests useful, I appreciate having the option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_NWxgNak3QY-jLQhjipxgCm_kA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360982/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are nine different-sized silicone ear tips, ranging from XXXS to XL, included in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PLYeeW077BLcza6TBH82WFT5z5A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360979/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0003_Edit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro case slides open.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YbjWARftIxaHe8UjMblAR_UZ7po=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360980/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a decorative gold fan-like cover over the earbud’s speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wbFAZL"&gt;The case, large and almost stone-like in appearance, slides to open and close with a satisfying click. It most closely resembles the case of the Galaxy Buds Pro — it’s longer than it is tall — but its larger size makes it not as pocketable as most earbud cases. There are three battery indicator lights on the front and a button for pairing around back. That may sound like a small detail, but I’ve come to really appreciate earbuds that have a physical button for pairing. It’s far easier to use than tapping the earbuds to pair like you have to on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Jabra Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQeVDK"&gt;Like most earbuds, the Air 2 Pro have tap controls when you’re wearing them: double-tap on the left bud to skip the next track, double-tap on the right for play and pause, or hold down for two seconds on either bud to toggle ambient sound modes. It’s great that the buds respond quickly to my taps, but I’m frustrated by how limited the controls are. All of them can be customized in the app, but I wish there was a single-tap or even triple-tap option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ4xRS"&gt;Either bud can be used independently of the other, and in-ear detection can be toggled on and off in Anker’s app. Take an earbud out of your ear, and your music will stop; put the bud back in your ear, and it will resume. The in-ear detection was a bit sensitive for my liking. When I had a hood on, for example, every time the earbud was knocked by my hood, my music would pause even if the bud was still seated in my ear. A quick readjustment of the bud would get my music playing again but ultimately turned off the in-ear detection feature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLnscI"&gt;The battery life is on par with other ANC earbuds. Anker claims seven hours of battery life with ANC turned off or six hours with it turned on. There are three additional charges in the case, which can be recharged wirelessly or via the USB-C port on the back. This was more than enough juice to get me to the point of my ears needing a break from the buds’ tight, in-ear seal. There is also 15-minute fast charging that can get three hours of listening time when the case is plugged into an outlet via USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jA6ItNw0-5LdIgqmJcrfmSXbX2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360978/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are three battery indicator lights on the front of the case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H4eFYG"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro support SBC and AAC audio codecs. They have 11mm drivers that create a more treble-heavy sound. While music felt full and immersive with crisp separation, I often wanted more bass. Lifting the lows in the app’s EQ helped, but it wasn’t as clean-sounding as the bass in the AirPods Pro. 1970s funk and soul sounded great, but more contemporary R&amp;amp;B felt a bit flat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKjfWA"&gt;I was most impressed with the active noise cancellation on the Liberty Air 2 Pro. Outside of Amazon’s Echo Buds, there really aren’t many options at this price that even include it, much less do it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jLtV7"&gt;The Air 2 Pro have three ambient sound modes: full noise cancellation, transparency mode, and normal. Within the full ANC and transparency modes, there are more specific controls for managing the levels of passthrough sound. You can enable a Transport mode for canceling low-end frequencies, such as train rumbles; Indoor mode for midrange frequencies; an Outdoor mode that Anker claims is best for city spaces; or build a custom mode for dialing in the best setting for you.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I set my ANC to Transport and left it there for most of my time and found it comparable to the ANC in the Jabra Elite 85t, a set of earbuds that costs $100 more than Anker’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrEyQM"&gt;The noise cancellation let the outside world fade away, but it wasn’t as isolating as the AirPods Pro or Galaxy Buds Pro. And although the transparency mode is serviceable, it doesn’t have the same earbud-less feel of the AirPods Pro either. There is a Vocal transparency mode that takes out lower frequencies while allowing higher frequencies, such as voices, through. It was helpful when listening for train announcements, but ultimately, taking an earbud out to hear an announcement was far easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y3JO_fZOB27cjAXZ1QJLwk34WfY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360985/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Soundcore app is is well-designed and easy to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wCO_npLr0ARMjYGoOeKEUCWZs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22360986/bfarsace_4467_20210310_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The app contains many ambient sound controls that are fun to play with.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="21jJej"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10386178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mYywUV"&gt;Most apps for wireless earbuds are so bad that I open them once to set EQ settings and some custom touch controls, and that’s it. The Soundcore app had me coming back to it time and time again, though, mostly to play with all of the different controls it offered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RACrzN"&gt;When I was bored on the train, I would open the app and start testing out all of the transparency modes while strangers spoke to each other across the car. I also had fun turning the EQ settings up and down. The app is filled with pleasing colors and is easy to navigate, which is surprisingly rare in the earbud market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ogyvn"&gt;In a wireless earbud market full of worthy (and not so worthy) competition, it is increasingly hard to be impressed by a new pair of buds. But the competitive $130 price tag of the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro brought me in, and their true active noise cancellation and well-designed app kept me coming back for more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;They could certainly use a bit more bass and a smaller case, but Anker has made a pair of wireless earbuds that bridges the gap between a more budget-friendly option and a reliable, all-around great earbud that I was excited to put into my ears every day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These new 3D-printed homes in Austin are going for $450K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k86FnKBX90OHC3i4HcXCCLjxmRI=/193x0:2308x1410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948804/3Strands_and_ICON_3D_Printed_Homes_AustinTX_2021_Exterior_2_Credit_LoganArchitecture.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the new 3D-printed homes in the East 17th Street Residences in Austin, Texas.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: ICON&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eF6dt9"&gt;When it showed off its 3D-printed homes at the South by Southwest festival back in 2018, Austin-based construction technology company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17101856/3d-printed-housing-icon-shelter-housing-crisis"&gt;ICON told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; its Vulcan printer could create an 800-square-foot structure for about $10,000. It seemed like only a matter of time before higher-end 3D-printed homes became a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EvWTA6"&gt;Now, a new development in East Austin is selling four houses built using ICON’s technology, starting at $450,000 (roughly the &lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/austin-tx/home-values/"&gt;median home price&lt;/a&gt; in Austin at present). To be clear, ICON 3D-printed the first floor of each of the two- to four-bedroom homes in the new East 17th Street Residences development; the upper floors were built using conventional construction. They’ll be ready for move-in this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKzimD"&gt;Watching the gigantic printer spit out what turns into a house is pretty mesmerizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SoRNQ3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a9cmTJw5cf0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CyFbQ5"&gt;The houses were designed by Austin-based firm Logan Architecture, and the developer on the project is 3Strands of Kansas City. “We want to change the way we build, own and how we live in community together,” 3Strands CEO Gary O’Dell said in a statement. “This project represents a big step forward, pushing the boundaries of new technologies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXeYML"&gt;Each of the houses took between five and seven days of printing time, and they’re between 1,000 and 2,000 square feet. The material used in the 3D-printing process is “a proprietary cementitious material called Lavacrete,” according to ICON, which it says is more durable than traditional construction materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJx7A4"&gt;So far, ICON has printed two dozen houses and structures across the US and Mexico, most of which are inhabited, including seven houses the company 3D-printed last year to house homeless people at Community First Village in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HVdI07"&gt;Although it’s touting the East 17th Street houses as the first 3D-printed homes for sale&lt;em&gt;, The Architect’s Newspaper&lt;/em&gt; notes that ICON may not be the first to produce 3D-printed homes for the commercial real estate market. Long Island-based SQ4D &lt;a href="https://www.archpaper.com/2021/02/3d-printed-home-on-long-islands-north-shore-hits-the-market/"&gt;claimed last month&lt;/a&gt; that it had the first “permitted” 3D-printed house in the US, a single-family residence in Riverhead, New York, listed at $300,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQjwfV"&gt;In addition to building its 3D-printed structures on planet Earth, &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/news/releases/2020/nasa-looks-to-advance-3d-printing-construction-systems-for-the-moon.html"&gt;ICON is working with NASA&lt;/a&gt; on research and development of a space-based construction system, with the ultimate goal of putting buildings on the Moon and Mars.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saRHsX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLMz8K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EifmSS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLNthj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUhwjN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUIqJr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zX7rW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grassroots online efforts are forming a new queer network of care</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IFfwYa3Y5IeFeM6_k63PreTBvpk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948725/rebekkaDunlap_210308_4419_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A decades-old caretaking tradition puts down digital roots&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OhQ88s"&gt;Almost exactly one year ago, Theo Hendrie thought he might have to drop out of school. His partner had lost his job, and they were struggling to pay bills and make ends meet. He worried that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbookshop.org%2Fbooks%2Fx-marks-the-spot-an-anthology-of-nonbinary-experiences%2F9781080968039&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22303892%2Fqueer-care-networks-online-queercare-for-the-gworls-transanta" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;X Marks The Spot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, his newly released anthology, might be the only creative project that he’d ever be able to complete. And then, at just the right time, Tuck Woodstock’s &lt;a href="https://www.genderpodcast.com/"&gt;Gender Reveal&lt;/a&gt; mutual aid program came through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxZBAd"&gt;“Up until then it was always, you know, when we’ve got a tenner we’ll put it into so-and-so’s top surgery fund, and they’ll probably put something into mine later on, and it all gets swapped around,” Hendrie says. “Whereas I think Tuck’s thing was the first time I saw something that was helping the community as a whole, and helping us to do something creative rather than just paying for medical bills.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7CUFGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It became just, ‘Do you need money to live? Do you need money in order to pay rent, to feed yourself, to pay for your medications?’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HxlomQ"&gt;Hendrie received £75, and credits the money with allowing him to stay in school. Admittedly, that doesn’t sound like a lot. But since then, he has graduated from university and returned, for a master’s degree in media and communications. Like the thousands of other folks who have benefited in some form or fashion from mutual aid, monetary assistance empowered him to pursue his goals and stabilize his life, sans disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIGUyX"&gt;Hendrie’s experience is not unique — all across the internet, people are accessing assistance and care through digital networks that, inevitably, spill into the offline, everyday lives of queer folks. When people in the LGBTQ community feel excluded from, unwelcome in, or underserved by mainstream health networks, groups like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/queercareinc/"&gt;QueerCare&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/forthegworls/"&gt;For The Gworls&lt;/a&gt; (FTG), and &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/transanta/"&gt;transanta&lt;/a&gt; step in, offering aid in the form of care and, often, cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAik07"&gt;Woodstock launched their mutual aid fund via Gender Reveal at the beginning of the pandemic, when it became obvious that people urgently needed help. The fund replaced what was originally the Gender Reveal Grant, which required folks to present their work to a panel of judges. It wasn’t appropriate for the moment, Woodstock says. “It became just, ‘Do you need money to live? Do you need money in order to pay rent, to feed yourself, to pay for your medications?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="chsZUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are just following in those footsteps”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUpt2O"&gt;Woodstock’s pivot to mutual aid and away from the Gender Reveal Grant is emblematic of a larger shift that happened in 2020, courtesy of COVID-19. It’s been well documented that the pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/8/e2020685118"&gt;exacerbated inequality&lt;/a&gt; across the board; in some marginalized communities, doubling down on care independent of mainstream systems was the recipe for survival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IbLgQU"&gt;But this building of DIY care networks has been decades in the making. Queer people and other marginalized groups have been doing this grassroots work for generations, and the modern ubiquity of GoFundMe pages and Instagram accounts is merely the latest chapter in a long history of alternative care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30LebM"&gt;Asanni Armon, founder of FTG, credits Langston Hughes and the rent parties of the Harlem Renaissance with the idea to raise money for Black trans people’s rent and gender-affirming surgery costs. “We are just following in those footsteps,” Armon says. “As long as we’ve been affected by the ills of capitalism, especially Black people, we’ve had to do this kind of work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDXP4z"&gt;Mutual aid can look like a lot of different things, depending on what you need — while Woodstock has sent money in amounts as big as $800 (and as small as Hendrie’s £75) via PayPal and Venmo, FTG just helped raise $50,000 for 23 young people to receive a year’s worth of hormone replacement therapy, through Point of Pride’s new &lt;a href="https://pointofpride.org/introducing-the-first-ever-recipients-of-the-hrt-access-fund/"&gt;HRT Access Fund&lt;/a&gt;. Historically, mutual aid has been a way for folks on the fringes of mainstream economies to collectively access resources and provide care; look at the Black Panther Party’s &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/news/free-school-breakfast-black-panther-party"&gt;breakfast program&lt;/a&gt;, or the AIDS activism of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/13/t-magazine/act-up-aids.html"&gt;ACT UP&lt;/a&gt;, and you’ll see the same network formation, sans internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p4xfai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pandemic put a stop to FTG’s rent parties, but it hasn’t slowed the proliferation of mutual aid programs within the queer community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WR8B0h"&gt;It’s no coincidence that these networks typically form alongside activism work, says Kirsty Clark, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Yale School of Public Health whose research focuses on LGBTQ mental health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0t8fN"&gt;“When folks are pushed to the margins, they create social networks through formal or informal channels where people can give each other information and support,” she says. “It’s this coming together to push back against persecution and to forge a feeling of belongingness within the group. And these networks not only produce peer support, but then can also lead to resources for medical care.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgTY9E"&gt;While the pandemic has put a stop to FTG’s rent parties, and forced organizations like &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/transdefensefundla/"&gt;Trans Defense Fund LA&lt;/a&gt; (TDFLA) to host their self-defense courses online, it has not slowed the proliferation of mutual aid programs within the queer community — quite the opposite. TDFLA just shipped out another 200 self-defense kits for trans folks in LA; FTG &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLCfISlDgoJ/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; on February 8th that, since its inception in July 2019, $1.1 million has been redistributed to Black trans folks around the world; Woodstock, of Gender Reveal, raised $100,000 in one month alone. Clearly, the practical implications of mutual aid are real, and, often, life-saving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QuGXlv"&gt;“The biggest success is that we are supplying people with the necessary tools they need and it’s going in their hands,” says Nikki Nguyen, the organizer behind TDFLA. “That’s the biggest part — just being able to provide this for the trans community.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lip-syncing app Wombo shows the messy, meme-laden potential of deepfakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7ipjC8QoBsbsPfutx46BcuM8hw=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68948550/wombo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;It’s Wombo time.  | Image: Wombo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVmKBW"&gt;You’ve probably already seen a Wombo video floating around your social media. Maybe it was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hero10108253313/status/1369524295710347267"&gt;Ryu from &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; singing the “Witch Doctor” or the last &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tmychow/status/1369794145708040193"&gt;three heads of the US Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; miming in unison to Rick Astley’s “Never Going to Give You Up.” Each clip features exaggerated facial expressions and uncanny, sometimes nightmarish animation. They’re stupid, fun, and offer a useful look at the current state of deepfakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SV7Vo8"&gt;It’s certainly getting quicker and easier to make AI-generated fakes, but the more convincing they are, the more work is needed. The realistic Tom Cruise deepfakes that went viral on TikTok, for example, required an experienced VFX artist, a top-flight impersonator, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22314980/tom-cruise-deepfake-tiktok-videos-ai-impersonator-chris-ume-miles-fisher"&gt;weeks of preparation&lt;/a&gt; to pull off. One-click fakes that can be created with zero effort and expertise, by comparison, still look like those made by the Wombo app and will continue to do so for the immediate future. In the short term, at least, deepfakes are going to be obviously fabricated and instant meme-bait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Xqt97X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/maximilian_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@maximilian_&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;I'm sorry capcom what have I done &lt;a href="https://t.co/5ogqveykl4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5ogqveykl4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hero101 (@Hero10108253313) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Hero10108253313/status/1369524295710347267?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UiIjoU"&gt;The Wombo app launched late last month from Canada after a short development process. “Back in August 2020 I had the idea for Wombo while smoking a joint with my roommate on the roof,” app creator and Wombo CEO Ben-Zion Benkhin tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Releasing the product was “an enormous joy,” he says. “I’ve been following the AI space, following the meme space, following the deepfake space, and just saw the opportunity to do something cool.” In just a few weeks, Benkhin estimates the app has seen some 2 million downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GxuviR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had the idea for Wombo while smoking a joint with my roommate”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sQK5km"&gt;Wombo is free and easy to use. Just snap a picture of your face or upload an image from your camera roll, and push a button to have the image lip-sync to one of a handful of meme-adjacent songs. The app’s software will work its magic on anything that even vaguely resembles a face and many things that don’t. Although similar apps in the past have been dogged by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697771/faceapp-privacy-concerns-ios-android-old-age-filter-russia"&gt;privacy fears&lt;/a&gt;, Benkhin is adamant users’ data is safe. “We take privacy really seriously,” he says. “All the data gets deleted and we don’t share it or send it to anyone else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rlA6z1"&gt;The app’s name comes from &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wombo-combo"&gt;esports slang&lt;/a&gt;, specifically &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Melee. &lt;/em&gt;“If a player lands like a crazy combination then the casters will start yelling ‘Wombo Combo! Wombo Combo!’” says Benkhin. True to these origins, Wombo has proved &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/10/22323562/wombo-ai-app-culture-twitter"&gt;particularly popular with gamers&lt;/a&gt; who’ve used it to animate characters from titles like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;. “I did some digging into [the origins of the slang],” says Benkhin, “and apparently there was some pizza place that started all this, where they would put a shit-ton of toppings on all their pizza and call it a Wombo Combo.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="een5pv"&gt;Benkhin says the app works by morphing faces using predefined choreography. He and his team shot the base video for each song in his studio (“which is really just a room in my apartment”) and then use these to animate each image. “We steal the motions from their face and apply it to your photo,” he says. The app is also an example of the fast-paced world of AI research, where new techniques can become consumer products in a matter of weeks. Benkhin notes that the software is built “on top of existing work” but with subsequent tweaks and improvements that make it “our own proprietary model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="meP9Dr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Have this cursed abomination I made using the Wombo app before I go to sleep &lt;a href="https://t.co/YrRyJKSkj3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YrRyJKSkj3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Starolu Platichu (@StaroluPlatichu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StaroluPlatichu/status/1369893585500348417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Am7vlq"&gt;Currently, Wombo offers just 14 short clips of songs to lip-sync with, but Benkhin says he plans to expand these options soon. When asked whether the app has the proper licenses for the music it uses, he demures to answer but says the team is working on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPWUeB"&gt;As with TikTok, though, it seems the reach offered by Wombo could help ameliorate license-holders’ worries about rights. Wombo has already been approached by artists wanting to get their music on the app, says Benkhin, and it’s likely this could offer a revenue stream in addition to the current premium tier (which pays for priority processing and no in-app ads). “It’s going to give [artists] a completely new way of engaging audiences,” he says. “It gives them this new viral marketing tool.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tuAAy7"&gt;Wombo is far from the first app to use machine learning to create quick and fun deepfakes. Others include ReFace and FaceApp. But it’s the latest example of what will be an ever-more prominent trend, as deepfake apps become the latest meme templates, allowing users to mash together favorite characters, trending songs, choreographed dances, public figures, and so much more. The future of deepfakes will definitely be memeified.&lt;/p&gt;
