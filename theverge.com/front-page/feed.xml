    <title>With legalization of marijuana, New York will expunge prior convictions</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g2O66u"&gt;New York has passed the &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/legislation-allow-adult-use-cultivation-recreational-marijuana-advances&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_content="&gt;Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act&lt;/a&gt;, legalizing the recreational use of marijuana in the state. The new legislation also expunges the records of people who were convicted on marijuana-related charges that are no longer criminalized. People with past convictions will be among those prioritized for licenses to cultivate, process, and sell marijuana products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eabVcJ"&gt;New Yorkers can now carry up to three ounces of cannabis or 24 grams of concentrates like oils and store up to five pounds at home. There are expansions to the state’s medical cannabis program, including the addition of more eligible conditions and a higher possession limit. The bill also prohibits using the smell of marijuana as justification for searching someone’s car, though it can still be used as a reason to suspect the driver is intoxicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU9yMt"&gt;Advocates have long been calling for reforms that address the disproportionate effects of drug criminalization on people of color. New Yorkers of color made up 94 percent of marijuana-related arrests and summonses in 2020, &lt;a href="https://legalaidnyc.org/news/nypd-data-people-of-color-94-percent-marijuana-arrests/"&gt;according to an analysis of NYPD data&lt;/a&gt; by The Legal Aid Society. “Because of the sheer extent of harm that had been inflicted on Black and Brown communities over the years, any marijuana reform that was brought forth had to be equally comprehensive to begin repairing the damage,” &lt;a href="https://drugpolicy.org/press-release/2021/03/victory-dpa-hails-historic-passage-marijuana-legalization-new-york"&gt;said Kassandra Frederique&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5vIau"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“End the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyHMJL"&gt;Tax revenue from marijuana sales will be directed toward education, job training, drug treatment programs, and other community initiatives. “My goal in carrying this legislation has always been to end the racially disparate enforcement of marijuana prohibition that has taken such a toll on communities of color across our state, and to use the economic windfall of legalization to help heal and repair those same communities,” said state Sen. Liz Krueger, who sponsored the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHmVfz"&gt;The law establishes “one of the most ambitious marijuana legalization programs in the nation,” said Melissa Moore, New York State director of the Drug Policy Alliance. “New York has taken bold action to put a nail in the coffin of the war on drugs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLDOB8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is supplying 120,000 HoloLens-based headsets to the US Army</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2uaeJelFDjmfF88vWzJii7paZic=/53x0:787x489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69056501/2nd_crop_hi_res_CS3_1__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: US Army&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jspLTi"&gt;Microsoft has won a contract to supply the US Army with HoloLens-based headsets. The contract could be worth up to $21.88 billion over 10 years, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that it will involve Microsoft supplying 120,000 headsets. The software maker has been working closely with the Army since 2018, and soldiers have been testing the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) headsets over the past two years. These devices combine high-resolution night, thermal, and soldier-borne sensors into a heads-up display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xNY1D"&gt;“The system also leverages augmented reality and machine learning to enable a life-like mixed reality training environment so the Close Combat Force (CCF) can rehearse before engaging any adversaries,” &lt;a href="https://www.peosoldier.army.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2556870/ivas-production-contract-award/"&gt;reads a US Army statement&lt;/a&gt;. In February, &lt;a href="https://www.army.mil/article/243505/ivas_goggle_amplifies_mounted_capabilities"&gt;the Army revealed&lt;/a&gt; how a newer, more ruggedized version of its heads-up display can let operators of armored vehicles see through the walls of, for instance, a Bradley Fighting Vehicle. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/6/18298335/microsoft-hololens-us-military-version"&gt;An earlier version&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/news-detail/us-army-ivas-problems-fixed-since-dote-findings"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; for poor sensor and GPS performance, but you can see that the design has now changed quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lM-ClyCU2SegPYy5zcAxw-1QC14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16012758/us_army_ivas_microsoft_hololens.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WvRgxIyWpWi3aEC33WcdWQ8F0bI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411482/max1200__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The newer IVAS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSZLSN"&gt;Microsoft initially won a $479 million contract to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18116939/microsoft-army-hololens-480-million-contract-magic-leap"&gt;supply the US Army with a version of its HoloLens augmented reality headset&lt;/a&gt; back in 2018. It was a move that was met with fierce resistance from some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18236116/microsoft-hololens-army-contract-workers-letter"&gt;Microsoft employees,&lt;/a&gt; forcing CEO Satya Nadella &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18240300/microsoft-ceo-defends-pentagon-contract-ar-headsets-employee-outcry"&gt;to respond&lt;/a&gt;. The calls didn’t stop the United States Department of Defense and Microsoft from working together on this new headset, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLLJiZ"&gt;“Microsoft has worked closely with the US Army over the past two years, and together we pioneered Soldier Centered Design to enable rapid prototyping for a product to provide Soldiers with the tools and capabilities necessary to achieve their mission,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/03/31/army-moves-microsoft-hololens-based-headset-from-prototyping-to-production-phase/"&gt;says Alex Kipman&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft’s HoloLens inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxbbBv"&gt;HoloLens hasn’t seen any significant hardware changes since the second version of Microsoft’s mixed reality headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/24/18235460/microsoft-hololens-2-price-specs-mixed-reality-ar-vr-business-work-features-mwc-2019"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has been gradually improving the software side of its HoloLens headsets, alongside gesture improvements. Recently, this has expanded to include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22308883/microsoft-mesh-virtual-reality-augmented-reality-hololens-vr-headsets-features"&gt;Microsoft Mesh&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s vision to support what Microsoft calls “holoportation,” allowing people to appear as themselves in a virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b887QT"&gt;While the initial wave of augmented reality and similar headsets like the HoloLens, Google Glass, and Snapchat Spectacles wound up pivoting their business models from end users to commercial, industrial and military applications, things appear to be heating up again in the space. Facebook reportedly has&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326875/facebook-reality-labs-ar-vr-headcount-report"&gt; nearly a fifth of its employees working on VR and AR&lt;/a&gt;, Apple charged its former hardware boss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272555/apple-dan-riccio-ar-vr-development"&gt;with overseeing AR and VR specifically&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/21/22294216/samsung-glasses-lite-ar-next-wearable-computing-concept-leak"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359117/snap-inc-snapchat-spectacles-4-drone-developers-creators"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296100/qualcomm-xr1-smart-viewer-ar-glasses-announce-lenovo-thinkreality-a3"&gt;Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnhanke/status/1376624749787242499"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; have been showing off more prototypes lately.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Periscope shuts down today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Periscope-app-stock-Nov2015-Verge-01" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nLQOmN0_AfI6RDo0Q0t5J5znOmA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69056404/Periscope-app-stock-Nov2015-Verge-01.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YTB0Nq"&gt;Periscope, the app that popularized live streaming from smartphones, is shutting down today, just over six years after it launched. The service has already been removed from app stores, and most features will no longer be accessible after today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="861Zgx"&gt;Live streaming will live on inside of Twitter, which has owned Periscope &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat"&gt;since March 2015&lt;/a&gt;, just weeks before the service launched. Twitter announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176842/twitter-periscope-shut-down-live-video-streaming-apps-2021"&gt;the impending shutdown&lt;/a&gt; in December, saying usage was declining, and the app had been in an “unsustainable maintenance-mode state” for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LaQssU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Live streaming was a phenomenon, and then it wasn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYErBO"&gt;The Periscope website will remain online with an archive of public broadcasts. Periscope users will still be able to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/periscope-faq"&gt;download their data&lt;/a&gt; through Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgkcTc"&gt;Live streaming became an overnight phenomenon in March 2015 with the debut of Periscope and another app called Meerkat. Though Meerkat came out first, Periscope was able to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8319043/why-is-meerkats-popularity-suddenly-plunging"&gt;quickly dethrone it&lt;/a&gt; with Twitter’s backing and become the leader in live streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE4YE1"&gt;The phenomenon seemed to subside just as quickly, however. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/5/9101127/facebook-live-for-mentions-periscope"&gt;heavily pushed live streaming&lt;/a&gt; on its own service, and no platform developed a dominant community around the feature. In December 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13942840/twitter-live-video-periscope-integration"&gt;Twitter added the ability to live stream&lt;/a&gt; directly from its own app, removing much of the need for Periscope as a standalone service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZIyyj4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is it. Our final goodbye. Today is the last day the Periscope app will be available.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We leave you with our gratitude for all the creators and viewers who brighten the Periscope community. We hope to see you all live on Twitter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/fRbYdEYInf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fRbYdEYInf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Periscope (@PeriscopeCo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeriscopeCo/status/1377318425404469248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Google ditches Mobile World Congress 2021, the world’s biggest phone show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Mobile World Congress 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u2GxiT5WqeYvGI294V0mGnWq-dM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69056253/vpavic_180225_2334_0048.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yVhHSz"&gt;Last year, the world’s largest phone show, Mobile World Congress, hung on to the idea of hosting an in-person event during the COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;as long as it could&lt;/a&gt;, even as major exhibitors kept pulling out — and the dominoes may be falling on this year’s show as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6K9zHH"&gt;Google just announced that it will not exhibit at MWC this year. It’s the biggest name so far, following major telecom infrastructure providers Nokia and Ericsson as well as Sony and Oracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYPZ4X"&gt;Here’s Google’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hE0o8q"&gt;Following our current COVID-19 travel restrictions and protocols, Google has made the decision to not exhibit at Mobile World Congress this year. We will continue to collaborate closely with GSMA and support our partners through virtual opportunities. We look forward to this year’s activities and seeing you in Barcelona in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="S2C4AE"&gt;In February, the GSMA (which runs Mobile World Congress) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;insisted that it would go ahead with the potential superspreader event this June&lt;/a&gt;, requiring only an array of standard precautions, mask-wearing, and a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of arrival, none of which are considered sufficient to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The org was not planning to require vaccinations at that time. Now that the vaccine situation is improving and another big name has bailed, I’m curious if organizers will change their minds.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Specialized Como SL e-bike review: mellow yellow</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A fun lightweight commuter from the maker of the Turbo Vado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cCW5rF"&gt;Specialized just released one of its most interesting electric bikes to date, the Como SL. The SL stands for “Super Light,” and Specialized is marketing it as an everyday commuter, perfect for zipping over to a friend’s house, picking up some groceries, or, if you really need to, carrying up a few flights of stairs. There’s even a hand grip built into the frame to help lift the bike when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JzBX"&gt;The Como SL is a slimmed-down version of Specialized’s Turbo Como, which is the company’s entry-level electric bike for commuters. The company is doubling down on a lot of the elements that made the Turbo Como so inviting to riders, while also adding a whole host of additional features — including aluminum fenders, a rear rack, and a front-mounted basket — without adding unnecessary pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlDKFz"&gt;For the last week and a half, I’ve had the pleasure of riding the Como SL all over my neighborhood to see how it measures up — not only to Specialized’s other highly capable, extremely powerful (and at times very pricy) e-bikes, but also to the other lightweight commuter e-bikes that have been flooding the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AS5sna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421956"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gFmo6e"&gt;I tackled steep hills, busy county roads without bike lanes, and even a languid ride through the park. While the Como SL is not the most powerful e-bike I’ve ever ridden, it is among the smoothest and easiest to handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLhUwx"&gt;Maybe it was the warming spring weather or the way the Como SL’s yellow paint job reflected the daffodils just now emerging from the ground, but I found this bike to be an absolute delight to ride. I did have some issues with the UX of the digital display, and the gearing left a little bit to be desired. But overall, the skill and craftsmanship Specialized put into the Como SL really shone through, and I think this will be a worthy addition to the company’s growing lineup of e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8ClsxKpsNx6e9i_24smEUOZd3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408145/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL has a surprising amount of cargo capacity for errands or other outings. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gBfy"&gt;Specialized may be based in California, but its design team is headquartered in a nondescript brick building in Cham, Switzerland. That’s where the company designs its Turbo-branded e-bikes like the Levo, Creo, Vado, and Como, as well as their Super Light variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlBMpq"&gt;To make the Como SL worthy of that suffix, the company started out by fully integrating the battery into the frame of the bike. Many direct-to-consumer e-bike brands have unsightly batteries perched on the downtube, while other companies have tried to have it both ways by integrating it into the frame while also having it be removable. Specialized decided to make its battery both fully integrated and non-removable, placing the Como SL in the same category as companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484541/ampler-stout-e-bike-review-its-not-easy-being-green"&gt;Ampler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;Gogoro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Dlni"&gt;“By integrating [the battery] we were able to make a really lightweight aluminum frame,” Dominik Geyer, head of business for Specialized’s Turbo brand, who is based in the company’s Swiss office, told me. “We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfkYvQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTrKNq"&gt;Specialized says the Como SL’s 320Wh battery should be good for 62 miles (100 kilometers) of range, depending on the terrain and power setting. I found that while riding in the middle “Sport” setting, I burned through nearly 100 percent of the battery in less than 35 miles. That’s pretty standard for an e-bike battery, but Specialized does offer an optional Range Extender for $449.99, which the company says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq44Qz"&gt;Specialized says the battery can recharge from 3 percent to 100 percent in approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes. There’s a port at the base of the downtube where you can plug in the 48V charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDCmWQ"&gt;Another driving factor was simplicity, Geyer said. Specialized wanted a bike that was easy to ride and even easier to maintain. The Gates carbon belt drive and internal geared hub motor speak to this desire, as well as the simplicity of the cockpit controls. “The bike simply needs to be a trusted partner in your daily life to get around,” Geyer added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YueJOM"&gt;Still, the Como SL isn’t exactly a featherweight. It essentially weighs the same as the Turbo Como — between 47 and 48.5 pounds, depending on the frame size — despite all those new accessories. That means Specialized has found other, unique ways to shave off some of that bulk without compromising on what makes it so much fun to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvAMUy"&gt;One of those is the SL motor, which tips the scale at 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). Compare that to the Turbo Como’s motor, which weighs about 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg), and you can see how much work Specialized put into shrinking down the components in this bike. The motor is developed jointly by Specialized and Brose, a German company that also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;e-bike motors for Harley-Davidson&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgW3Cl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61fDnG"&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right, to some extent. Specialized says the Como SL’s rear-hub motor has 240W of peak and continuous power as well as 35Nm of torque. That’s slightly less than the Turbo Como, which has a mid-drive motor rated for 250W of nominal power and 415W of peak and 50Nm of torque. Specialized says the Turbo Como offers riders four times their natural power input while pedaling, while the Como SL only delivers twice as much power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjfrec"&gt;That becomes readily apparent when powering up a steep hill. I found myself having to exert a lot more force than I usually do when riding an e-bike, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate an e-bike that makes you work a little bit harder to get you to where you’re going, though I realize I might be in the minority with that opinion, especially if your goal is to arrive at your office job sweat-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoLXOB"&gt;Overall, the look of the bike is very clean and polished, with all the wires integrated into the bike’s frame. That’s a stark contrast to most DTC e-bikes, which typically come with a rat’s nest of wires tangled around the handlebars. After all, there are clear advantages to going with an e-bike from a legacy bike company. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Front and back lights are connected to the bike’s battery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYjVfaMFfE1q1kDvYGHoIIcik88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408078/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The display has left and right buttons to toggle between different screens. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4JYT"&gt;Let’s talk about the digital display because this was my least favorite part about the Como SL. The LCD display is small by e-bike standards, 2.5 x 2 inches, or about the size of a pack of gum. There are only two buttons, left and right, which can be used to scroll through a half-dozen different screens showing speed, odometer, calories burned, distance traveled, and a timer. It’s a clean design, but I found it to be over-simplified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAxwoZ"&gt;The real controls are routed through Specialized’s smartphone app, Mission Control, which is paired with the bike via Bluetooth. I’ll be completely honest: I am not a fan of app-based controls for e-bikes. It was one of my few beefs with Gogoro’s Eeyo 1S, and the same goes for the Como SL. I understand that by offloading certain controls to an app, manufacturers can offer nicer graphics and more functionality while saving on the costs associated with the on-bike display. And you don’t need the app to actually turn the bike on; the button for that is placed on a nice rubber pad in the downtube, along with a series of blue light bars that indicate battery strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIZTw"&gt;But when I’m riding an e-bike, I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone. The Como SL doesn’t come with a standard phone mount. Although one could certainly be purchased separately, I’d struggle to find a place to mount it. The sloping handlebars would likely direct the phone’s display off to the side. And the LCD screen is mounted in the center, which would be another obvious place for a mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ5xed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYAsBj"&gt;The good part about the app is the level of fine-tuning it allows. You can customize the power settings to fit your riding style. The “Smart Control” feature automatically tailors the electronic assist in real time based on the information you input, such as how far you plan on riding. That worked well when I took the Como SL on a 10-mile ride with a lot of steep hills. The gearing on this bike is also among the most seamless I’ve ever experienced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kUABm"&gt;My last issue with the Como SL is the price. Specialized’s build quality is among the best in the industry, so you won’t be surprised to learn that this bike is very expensive. There are two versions of the Como SL: the 4.0, which retails for $4,000, and the 5.0, which sells for $4,800. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/26/prices-on-the-rise-more-major-us-e-bike-companies-hike-prices-under-cost-squeeze/"&gt;Prices for e-bikes have been increasing across the board&lt;/a&gt;, with tariff exemptions expiring, but these prices certainly put the Como SL in the premium category that will be unaffordable to many people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnAmZy"&gt;The difference between the two is the number of gears in the Shimano drivetrain. The Como SL 4.0 features the 5-speed Nexus system, while the 5.0 comes with the 8-speed Alfine. There are also different paint jobs that come with both. The 4.0 comes in three colors: “cast umber,” “dove grey,” and “raspberry.” The 5.0, which is the one I tested, comes in “brassy yellow,” “brushed silver,” and “smoke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dc8joiTT970ppQwPQeZdNRTJI6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408082/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL is very approachable, with a low-step frame that makes mounting and dismounting a breeze. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kg2YLB"&gt;Specialized claims both bikes can reach a top speed of 28mph — which technically puts them in the speed pedelec category. However, on a flat surface and in the highest “Turbo” power setting, I was only able to get up to 24–25 mph. Not a huge deal, but it still left me wondering what I was missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQdjvP"&gt;Overall, the Como SL is a super fun, super lightweight, very approachable electric bike. The shape and contours of the frame are inviting, the front basket and rear rack allow for a decent amount of storage, and the drivetrain is extremely simple to use. Although I would have preferred less reliance on the app for basic functionality, I’m also not a Luddite, and I realize this is a direction some e-bikes appear to be heading. Fortunately, it’s not ubiquitous, so there’s still time to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BC1VRV"&gt;The price may deter those looking for something inexpensive. But for fans of Specialized — or for anyone who’s interested in an e-bike from a trusted company with decades of experience in the building, selling, and maintenance of bikes, both traditional and electric, — the Como SL should be the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfLPgE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxPWLs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 31st, 3:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Como SL 4.0 is $4,000, and the Como SL 5.0 is $4,800. A previous version of this review included incorrect prices due to a miscommunication by Specialized. As a result, we have reduced our score for the Como SL and have updated the review to reflect the correct prices. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will recalibrate iPhone 11 batteries to fix performance and capacity issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s6UobovBkZN2k4tEaUbFNgCdWuM=/0x40:700x507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055875/ios14_iphone11_pro_settings_battery_battery_health_recalibrating_maximum_capacity_and_peak_performance_capability_crop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NJb6HW"&gt;Apple will try to fix battery drain and reduced performance issues that have affected some iPhone 11 devices by recalibrating their batteries in an upcoming update (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/31/ios-14-5-iphone-11-battery-recalibration/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). According to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212247#messages"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt;, the process will happen when you update an iPhone 11, 11 Pro, or 11 Pro Max to the upcoming iOS 14.5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9aFej"&gt;It might take a few weeks for &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387"&gt;the battery health system&lt;/a&gt; to figure out how much capacity your battery has left, and how much performance it can provide, according to the document. It doesn’t seem like users should notice too much of a difference during the process, though there will be a message in the battery health section of the settings menu explaining what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgJtMq"&gt;The process is currently being tested in the latest release of the developer beta, but given that Apple has a support page already up for it, there’s a good chance it’ll make it into the final release. If the recalibration fails, for some reason, Apple says it or an authorized service provider will replace the battery for free. Hopefully, if you were experiencing battery issues with your iPhone 11, this process will help alleviate them when 14.5 is finally released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gb0Pcl"&gt;It’s not unusual that Apple would release a document about a battery change before it starts happening. The company has been a lot more transparent when it makes changes to the iPhone’s power delivery system ever since it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16806582/apple-battery-slowdown-science"&gt;caught throttling the performance of older iPhones&lt;/a&gt; to protect the battery.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft says controversial Georgia law will ‘unfairly restrict the rights of people to vote’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft campus stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q40lPInTqiUApZey4YZkPhv2F2Q=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055739/Microsoft-_from-Msft_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mdYQvk"&gt;Microsoft is rarely shy about wading into the political conversation these days, and &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/31/why-we-are-concerned-about-georgias-new-election-law/"&gt;the latest missive&lt;/a&gt; from president Brad Smith is no exception: in a blog post titled “Why we are concerned about Georgia’s new election law,” he slams the state’s new Election Integrity Act for making it harder for its employees (and others) to vote — making Microsoft the first big tech company to speak out against the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ODHEz"&gt;If it’s not clear why Microsoft would go out on a limb to challenge the state on this particular issue, there are a few things you should probably know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="VIXHUA"&gt;As Smith points out, Microsoft is becoming a big employer in the state — he says Atlanta is “on the path toward becoming one of Microsoft’s largest hubs in the United States in the coming decade, after Puget Sound and Silicon Valley.” He writes that Microsoft’s workers alone will likely have 80 percent fewer drop boxes for their ballots as a direct result of the law, among other restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0VwHKp"&gt;Big employers in Georgia are currently under scrutiny from activists, including some threatening to boycott both Delta Air Lines and Coke for failing to condemn the law. #BoycottDelta and #BoycottCocaCola were trending topics, &lt;a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/delta-coke-face-boycott-campaigns-over-new-georgia-voting-law/ZJUGGDO3HBA3BF2J64WVOQ5YE4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday. Though Delta and Coca-Cola have each now called the bill “unacceptable” &lt;a href="https://news.delta.com/ed-bastian-memo-your-right-vote"&gt;in a new memo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1377325405468823560"&gt;a new interview&lt;/a&gt; respectively, it may be a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1377309103786225667"&gt;little late&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is now positioning itself favorably compared to these other big companies, largely by being a newcomer that already issued &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BradSmi/status/1374072187263533057"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzSa7J"&gt;Smith, the company’s former chief legal officer, is still toeing the line here. While many critics of the Georgia law are happily calling it a form of voter suppression, Microsoft simply explains how this might be “challenging” for voters rather than tugging on heartstrings. Smith doesn’t get any spicier than “From our perspective, there is no rational basis for the Georgia legislature to authorize secure drop boxes but limit their use so severely” or “Can anyone imagine telling taxpayers that they must stop using a mailbox to send in their tax return four days before taxes are due?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UZbPV2"&gt;There’s no promise of any action from Microsoft, just a hope that “companies will come together and make clear that a healthy business requires a healthy community,” and that “we should work together to press the Georgia legislature to change it.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Eb6WIV"&gt;It’s nice to see Microsoft — or any company — voice a desire to maintain or improve voting rights and explain why, though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google union wins dispute over discussing pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iBLgDy2bj3q87LLPPjOPr7Nh97I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055725/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xnVHXJ"&gt;Google is telling workers they are allowed to discuss pay and working conditions as part of a settlement agreement with the Alphabet Workers Union (AWU), &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/google-promises-not-to-muzzle-staff-on-pay-settling-labor-case?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The move settles a labor dispute &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-04/alphabet-union-alleges-contract-workers-were-silenced-about-pay?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;brought by AWU in February&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hwhu5L"&gt;The initial complaint alleged that managers at Adecco, a Google subcontracting firm, banned workers from talking about wages and bonuses. It also said that Adecco retaliated against contractor Shannon Wait after she posted pro-union messages on Facebook. The complaint said Google was a joint employer and should therefore be held liable for the treatment of contractors. Google did not admit to this classification in the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC4Iju"&gt;Wait, who’d been suspended from her job, was reinstated a week after the complaint was filed. She left the company shortly after, as her contract was only for two years, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAgTq"&gt;On Twitter, she credited the union with helping her get her job back. “The external pressure of our #union, which is only 3 months public, held both Google and its subcontractor accountable for violating labor law,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ComradeShannon/status/1377315839389659142"&gt;she wrote&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s 2021 — the year that tech companies like #Amazon and #Google stand face-to-face with workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjQjC"&gt;Google is posting signs at the data center in South Carolina as part of the agreement. “WE WILL NOT tell you that you cannot discuss policies with other employees,” the notice reads, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. “WE WILL NOT discipline you because you exercise your right to discuss wage rates, bonuses, hours and working conditions with other employees.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x53f3E"&gt;It’s a symbolic victory for the Alphabet Workers Union. The organization, which launched in January, is not currently recognized by the National Labor Relations Board. The complaint brought against Google and Adecco, however, shows the union still has teeth. Its status as a solidarity union also allows it to welcome contractors to the group. The treatment of these workers is a primary concern for union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfY0dJ"&gt;News of the settlement comes as workers at Amazon face off with management in a union fight that could change the fabric of the tech industry. Warehouse workers in Bessemer, Alabama &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/28/22352987/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-vote-rwdsu"&gt;voted this month on whether to form a union&lt;/a&gt;. The vote count began yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
