    <title>Ford, Argo, and Walmart are bringing robo-delivery to three US cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AIW1XfGy_OI49ht9LXomPHxH77M=/68x0:3935x2578/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860575/Argo_Walmart_exterior_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Frz4iL"&gt;Ford and Walmart are teaming to launch a robo-delivery service in three US cities, using autonomous test vehicles equipped with sensors and software developed by Argo AI. Customers who live in Miami, Austin, and Washington, DC, who order items from Walmart online and live within a specific geographic area may be eligible to have their items delivered by a Ford/Argo vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s43qoq"&gt;The companies plan on kicking off “integration testing” for the delivery service this year, with plans to expand the geographic areas over time. Autonomous delivery is seen as a potentially lucrative market, with online grocery shopping growing fivefold over the next decade and American consumers spending upward of $100 billion on food-at-home items by 2025, according to a recent report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPIfHn"&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now. In 2018, it announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18087898/ford-walmart-postmates-self-driving-grocery-delivery-miami"&gt;grocery delivery pilot with Walmart and Instacart&lt;/a&gt;. The automaker has also been helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16213544/dominos-ford-pizza-self-driving-car"&gt;Domino’s deliver pizza&lt;/a&gt; using its autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hfPhNQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford has been experimenting with robo-delivery for a number of years now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hknh0v"&gt;There are still a lot of hurdles to work out. The vehicles will require human monitors, both behind the wheel as well as from remote command centers, so any potential labor savings would still be years away. Customers would have to retrieve their deliveries from the vehicles, which could pose problems for elderly and disabled customers, as well as people who live in apartment buildings and are accustomed to delivery workers bringing their orders to their door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGIc8m"&gt;Ford isn’t the only company that’s trying to work through these challenges. Cruise, which is backed by General Motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21557603/cruise-walmart-autonomous-vehicles-delivery-arizona"&gt;has its own pilot project with Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in Arizona. In fact, the retail giant is hedging its bets by forging non-exclusive partnerships with a wide-range of AV operators, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004678/nuros-driverless-delivery-robots-walmart-houston"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173776/udelv-self-driving-delivery-walmart-baidu-ces-2019"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611760/waymo-walmart-self-driving-vehicles-groceries-discounts"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65AUNZ"&gt;Delivery is just one aspect of Ford’s plan to commercialize autonomous vehicles. The automaker recently announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585764/ford-argo-lyft-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi-miami-austin"&gt;partnering with Lyft&lt;/a&gt; to deploy robotaxis in the same three cities before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RlMzcM"&gt;In addition to Austin, Miami, and DC, Ford and Argo have been testing their fourth-generation vehicles in Pittsburgh, Detroit, and California. Argo is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;preparing to launch an autonomous micro-transit and delivery service with VW&lt;/a&gt; in Germany, using its fifth-generation autonomous technology, starting in 2025. The AV company is rumored to be mulling an initial public offering at a $12.4 billion valuation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram internal research: ‘We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oeXfEhNnF5b8l5SnyozM2_fyfB0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860490/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZPVQGv"&gt;How bad is Instagram for the mental health of its younger users? It’s a hugely important question, especially with Facebook planning to launch a version of the app for children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI2TBp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests the answer is “pretty bad,” based on internal research conducted by Facebook that it’s been unwilling to share with the public. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;recently&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;got access to these in-depth studies, which paint a bleak picture of the detrimental effects Instagram has on its younger users, particularly teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMysGL"&gt;For this latter group, Instagram is a powerful engine for “social comparison” — when one judges one’s own value, attractiveness, and success based on comparisons with others. Teenage girls are often blasted with images of idealized bodies on Instagram, appearing as adverts, images in their feeds, and content in the app’s Explore page. This often has a negative affect on these users’ mental health. As one slide from an internal Facebook presentation put it: “We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls.” (The figure referred to teenagers who already reported body image issues of some type.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gqWzk"&gt;The report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;worth reading in full&lt;/a&gt;, but here are some highlights from Facebook’s internal research into the effect Instagram has on younger users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="P0HCzB"&gt;One study by Facebook of teen Instagram users in the US and UK found that more than 40 percent of those who reported feeling “unattractive” said the feelings started when using Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LLn2j4"&gt;Research reviewed by Facebook’s top executives concluded that Instagram was engineered towards greater “social comparison” than rival apps like TikTok and Snapchat. TikTok is more focused on performance and Snapchat on jokey filters that “keep the focus on the face.” Instagram, by comparison, spotlights users’ bodies and lifestyles more often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZRCFio"&gt;Teens told Facebook’s researchers that they felt “addicted” to Instagram and wanted to check it less often, but didn’t have the self-control to rein in their usage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="azEpSu"&gt;“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said internal research by Facebook presented in 2019, and that “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yO6Eay"&gt;Facebook found that among teens who said they had suicidal thoughts, 13 percent of UK users and 6 percent of US users said these impulses could be tracked back to the app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="t8S6dM"&gt;Such findings are significant in their own right, but become particularly damning for Facebook when compared with the evasiveness of its public statements. As the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes, the company’s top executives, including CEO Mark Zuckerberg, have been quizzed by politicians like Senator Richard Blumenthal on the effects of its apps on younger users, but have not disclosed anything like the detailed findings created by its own internal studies. According to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, the company told senators that its research was proprietary and was “kept confidential to promote frank and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4l4Wqq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco — targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ySxxI4"&gt;Sen. Blumenthal told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; in an email: “Facebook’s answers were so evasive — failing to even respond to all our questions — that they really raise questions about what Facebook might be hiding [...] Facebook seems to be taking a page from the textbook of Big Tobacco —targeting teens with potentially dangerous products while masking the science in public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2C9AK"&gt;Facebook has made attempts to deal with these issues through changes to Instagram’s user interface, like an experiment to hide like counts (a metric that teens told Facebook made them anxious). But the company said this change didn’t seem to have much affect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlXE3J"&gt;“It turned out that it didn’t actually change nearly as much about … how people felt, or how much they used the experience as we thought it would,” Instagram chief Adam Mosseri &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456206/instagram-hiding-likes-experiment-results-platformer"&gt;told reporters in May&lt;/a&gt;. “But it did end up being pretty polarizing. Some people really liked it, and some people really didn’t.” Instead of rolling out the change to all users, Instagram kept like counts on by default but gave users the &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/giving-people-more-control"&gt;option to turn them off&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6SGya8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Prime now includes free Deliveroo deliveries in the UK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="UK Daily Life 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZIqoTk8RCGWqDYPZ_8iakWUEv_w=/57x0:2490x1622/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860431/1320373926.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nathan Stirk/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2zN1Ny"&gt;Amazon is now offering a year of Deliveroo Plus with its Prime subscription in the UK. Amazon Prime customers will be able to access the silver tier of Deliveroo Plus free of charge, enabling free deliveries on orders over £25. Deliveroo normally charges £3.49 a month for Deliveroo Plus, making this a saving of more than £40 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snQn7r"&gt;Deliveroo Plus includes unlimited free deliveries of food from a variety of participating restaurants. You’ll either need to be eating a lot or ordering for two or more people to really take advantage of the service, though. You’ll need to hit a minimum spend of £25 or more per order to benefit from free deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpbLuk"&gt;The partnership comes more than two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18628974/amazon-deliveroo-investment-575-million-uber-eats-uk"&gt;Amazon invested in UK-based food delivery company Deliveroo&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon led a $575 million funding round in Deliveroo, which used the investment to expand its engineering team and delivery reach. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had some initial reservations about the deal, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225099/amazon-deliveroo-investment-funding-food-delivery-restaurant-industry"&gt;cleared it last year&lt;/a&gt; just as the pandemic was hammering the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYAmNq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon tried to compete with Deliveroo years ago&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNob2p"&gt;Ahead of the investment in Deliveroo, Amazon briefly participated in the restaurant delivery wars in the UK. Amazon launched its restaurant delivery service in London in 2015, but it failed to compete with similar services like Deliveroo and UberEats. Amazon Restaurants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/26/18112620/amazon-restaurants-delivery-uk-london-cancelled"&gt;quietly ended two years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYAZE2"&gt;Amazon has previously included similar perks with its Prime subscription, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18284382/twitch-prime-nintendo-switch-online-service-free-amazon-subscribers"&gt;a year of Nintendo’s Switch Online service&lt;/a&gt;. If you have Amazon Prime and you’re interested in claiming the year of free Deliveroo Plus, you can link your accounts over at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=26804070031"&gt;Amazon’s site here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a new bubbles emoji that’ll go just great with the peach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfD5EeSAW2Yi7XjidCkCbNSq420=/0x3:908x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69860402/image__3_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;My editor put together this image disturbingly soon after I pitched this article.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Thomas Ricker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IwU0Vi"&gt;If I were an emoji sommelier, there’s one pairing I’d definitely be recommending after looking at this year’s 37-strong selection of &lt;a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2021/09/announcing-unicode-standard-version-140.html"&gt;finalized emoji&lt;/a&gt;. And that’s a combination of the new “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/bubbles/"&gt;bubbles&lt;/a&gt;” emoji with the existing “peach.” The former emoji has just been finalized with version 14.0 of the Unicode Standard, but the collection has been public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578697/new-emoji-14-0-finalists-unicode-consortium"&gt;since earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lt8S7Y"&gt;The reason is simple. Peach has long pulled double duty as the internationally recognized symbol for the human butt, making “butt bubbles” an elegant euphemism for farts. Sure, you’ve long been able to tell a similar visual story by combining the peach with the gust of wind emoji (which I now see is technically called “&lt;a href="https://emojipedia.org/dashing-away/"&gt;dashing away&lt;/a&gt;”). But now you’ve got more options. Like if you wanted to symbolize the act of emitting gas in a bath, or swimming pool, you monster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emoji shown in the prior image, in addition to a melting face, face with hand over mouth, face with eye peeking through fingers, saluting face, face with dotted lines around it, face holding back tears, as well as heart hands, snapping fingers, pointing index finger, and handshakes, all with different skin tones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwRPFh-9t83V-nILuDkvUtE7wH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719624/emojipedia_14_draft_world_emoji_day_july_2021.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/new-emojis-in-2021-2022/" target="_blank"&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yw6J0F"&gt;The list, which is &lt;a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-14-0/"&gt;nicely summarized by &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also includes new faces like “biting lip” and “saluting face.” Unfortunately for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhy-do-English-people-salute-magpies&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F15%2F22675134%2Funicode-emoji-version-14-bubbles-saluting-face-biting-lip-2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;English people looking to ward off bad luck&lt;/a&gt;, there isn’t yet a magpie emoji to pair the latter with. New hand gestures include a pair of hands creating the shape of a heart, and a hand pointing towards the screen. As part of this release, handshakes between hands of different skin tones are now officially supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo3Ufl"&gt;Finally, there are also new gender options for pregnancy, including emoji for “pregnant person” and “pregnant man.” A new “person with crown” joins the existing “prince” and “princess” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUgHkc"&gt;Now that the list of emoji has been finalized, it’s up to the major platform holders to add the designs into their software, which for most is likely to happen next year between January and August, according to &lt;em&gt;Emojipedia&lt;/em&gt;. If you’re interested in learning about how emoji are made, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Jay Peters was involved in the creation of this year’s “bubbles” and “saluting face” emoji, and previously submitted proposals for “yawning face” and “waffle.” You can read all about the process he went through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhinyE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6H3oko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo finally adds Bluetooth audio to the Switch in new software update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QfbsuIF4qKyfEGGIezmG2oYo_YA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859425/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_zelda.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="i8DIv7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1437930124490457088?s=20"&gt;Nintendo has surprise-announced&lt;/a&gt; that Bluetooth audio support has come to the Switch through a software update. The ability to use Bluetooth headphones to listen to game audio has been a conspicuously missing feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;since the console launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s great to finally have it — though there are some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnRnpc"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55973"&gt;a Nintendo support article&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll be limited to using two wireless controllers if you’ve got a Bluetooth headset attached. The system also won’t support Bluetooth microphones, which isn’t necessarily surprising given that Nintendo’s own voice chat system relies on an app running on your phone. Still, it’s a bummer for people who play games with their own built-in voice chat abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="DqJk5J"&gt;People have gone through great lengths to get wireless audio on their Switch (we even said that it’d be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;a great selling point for a Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt;): there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/13/17570350/nintendo-switch-wireless-headphones-bluetooth-audio-support-adapter"&gt;have been accessories&lt;/a&gt; that acted as Bluetooth audio adapters, and some headsets like the SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20836987/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-usb-c-nintendo-switch-gaming"&gt;came with a dongle&lt;/a&gt; that took advantage of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/10/20/16507816/nintendo-wireless-usb-headphones-switch-update-firmware"&gt;Switch’s support for USB wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Rl2m3"&gt;Having Bluetooth audio built-in is a big deal, then — especially considering that Nintendo’s Pro Controller, unlike many others, doesn’t include a headphone jack (though it’s worth noting that the &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/ps5-xbox-series-x-how-to-use-wireless-headphones"&gt;PS5 and Xbox Series don’t natively support Bluetooth audio&lt;/a&gt;). Even with the aforementioned limitations, the feature seems to be well-supported: Nintendo says that the Switch can save up to 10 connected devices, and says that it should work with both the regular Switch and the Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqRTYD"&gt;My colleague Jay Peters was able to connect his AirPods Pro to his base Switch and a Switch Lite without much trouble. In the settings menu, there’s a section for “Bluetooth Audio,” and you can pair your headphones from there by following the instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zAvZt3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My colleague’s AirPods Pro worked well with WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HqUvIw"&gt;Jay’s AirPods Pro worked well in a few rounds of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22632465/warioware-get-it-together-nintendo-switch-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WarioWare: Get It Together&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with no noticeable delay — something that’s particularly important for &lt;em&gt;WarioWare’s&lt;/em&gt; fast-paced, twitchy microgames. While using his base Switch, Jay also reports that after a cold boot, his AirPods Pro paired nearly instantly after selecting them again in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcEzMT"&gt;However, Sean Hollister’s second-generation Switch (not a Lite) had trouble finding and connecting to any Bluetooth devices whatsoever. He got an Arctis Pro Wireless to connect after rebooting the Switch three times, but most attempts ended in failure, including with a set of first-gen Amazon Echo Buds and Wyze Buds Pro, a Bluetooth adapter for the Bose QC25 and an LG TV set. While some of them would&lt;em&gt; sometimes&lt;/em&gt; appear available for pairing, the gaming system spit out an “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message even after repeated attempts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYPVAs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-updates-and-change-history#current"&gt;According to the changelog&lt;/a&gt;, the update also adds some features to make wired internet more useful. The Switch will be able to stay connected to the internet even in sleep mode if it’s hardwired in, seemingly either through an adapter or the built-in LAN port on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;upcoming Nintendo Switch OLED dock&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo says that this will help the console download content while it’s asleep, and that the feature will be on by default. Oh, and also you may have to do &lt;a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/55980"&gt;firmware updates&lt;/a&gt; for the dock with the built-in LAN port. I wouldn’t expect those to be as exciting as this update though.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Where are Apple’s new Macs? Here’s what we’re still expecting Apple to announce this year   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W5nXzy"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” event&lt;/a&gt; was packed with announcements, from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt; and forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple"&gt;sixth-gen iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt;. We expected much of this, yet, there were a number of things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;we had anticipated&lt;/a&gt; that Apple might announce but didn’t, including new MacBook Pros and next-gen AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvt4P8"&gt;However, it looks like there’s still hope they may make an appearance soon, especially given that October is historically when Apple will showcase new Macs. According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s reliable Apple-watcher, Mark Gurman, Apple will likely &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1437140403803672581"&gt;hold at least one more&lt;/a&gt; online event within the next “several weeks,” which means Apple may still reveal the no-shows from today before the end of 2021. Here are some of the more noteworthy omissions we expect to see in the months ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cLH8qg"&gt;New MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jFiS2O"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;redesigned 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; powered by a new &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/apple-m1x-vs-m2-chip-what-we-know-so-far-and-what-it-means-for-new-macbooks"&gt;M1X chip&lt;/a&gt; — the rumored name for an enhanced variant of Apple’s M1 chip that made its debut last year — could make an appearance as early as next month, Gurman predicts. Rumor has it the new laptops will reportedly feature a flat-edged redesign and the return of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244011/apple-new-macbook-air-design-magsafe-charger-report"&gt;magnetic MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the reintroduction of previously excised inputs like the HDMI port and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244398/apple-2021-macbook-pro-sd-card-slot-report-ports-refresh"&gt;SD card slot&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7vfx8O"&gt;New Mac Minis, iMacs, and Mac Pro workstations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NkHzJz"&gt;After Apple unveils the MacBook Pro, Gurman &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;also speculates&lt;/a&gt; we may see an upgraded Mac Mini, a bigger iMac, an updated Mac Pro workstation, and even a “new low-end MacBook Pro.” Each machine will also be reportedly powered by the next generation of Apple’s in-house chips, which will “will greatly outpace the performance and capabilities of the current M1 chips,” according to Gurman’s anonymous sources. Still, there’s no guarantee Apple will unveil these before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="blmZS4"&gt;Next-gen AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XYABES"&gt;It was &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-apple-event-tuesday/"&gt;heavily rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Apple would unveil the third generation of AirPods during its iPhone 13 event, so it was a huge surprise when the company didn’t. It’s possible, however, that we could still see these make their debut before the holiday season starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMWMyT"&gt;When they do arrive, the new AirPods will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;reportedly boast&lt;/a&gt; some of the most significant changes in form since their 2016 debut. It’s likely the new pair will mirror the AirPods Pro in design, with a new case and shorter stems. However, that may be where the similarities between the two end — noise cancellation, for example, may remain exclusive to the Pro model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZjAfT"&gt;The new AirPods are expected to retail anywhere between $150 and $200, and it’s not clear yet whether Apple will sell two different versions — one with and one without a wireless charging case — like it does with the current non-Pro AirPods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j7cEfE"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GyvvHU"&gt;During Tuesday’s keynote, Apple announced that the next iteration of its smartwatch operating system, watchOS 8, will launch alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;iOS 15 and iPadOS 15&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;September 20th&lt;/a&gt;. macOS users, however, are still in the dark as to when, exactly, they might see the official release of macOS Monterey, the successor to macOS Big Sur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wACDT6"&gt;macOS Monterey — which was first introduced as a free update during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt; and has been testing in public beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557880/apple-macos-public-beta-facetime-safari-updates"&gt;since July&lt;/a&gt; — is still presumingly set to arrive in the fall, which what’s listed &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F14%2F22674369%2Fapple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt;. The update brings improvements to FaceTime, Safari, and a slew of other apps. Monterey will also introduce features such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596970/apple-macos-monterey-live-text-intel-processors"&gt;Live Text&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control&lt;/a&gt;, a feature that allows you to control and quickly move files across multiple Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YUncrx"&gt;Given the lack of Mac updates during Tuesday’s event, it seems possible that Apple could announce the release date of Monterey during the rumored event in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="f0QJze"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to install the macOS Monterey public beta","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The Holmes trial gets into the Excel nitty-gritty</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pYFWVJ_fUh8hNfAOON_3x81Y630=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859367/1235132476.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;David Odisho / Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But will the technical jargon overwhelm the jurors?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0hR02D"&gt;It was around the time that the defense counsel referred to “deferred revenue” that I began to feel genuinely bad for the members of the jury in the wire fraud trial of Elizabeth Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tIy8A"&gt;Tuesday’s testimony involved the nuances of accounting, how quality control works in labs, and way too many Excel spreadsheets. I get it — you have to show the financials to show that Theranos was in a tricky financial position. And you have to show how the labs were failing in order to establish that they were failing &lt;em&gt;and that Holmes knew it.&lt;/em&gt; But go through this too fast, and you risk confusing people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cHqKlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every scam is, at bottom, about the same thing: getting money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D911L3"&gt;The case’s first witness, Theranos’s corporate controller, Danise Yam (she also goes by So Han Spivey), gave testimony that was crucial for making the government’s case. Every scam is, at bottom, about the same thing: getting money. If Elizabeth Holmes committed wire fraud, as the government alleges, it would have been with the goal of getting more cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FvvhM"&gt;To that end, prosecutor Robert Leach had Yam go through a series of Excel spreadsheets, often attached to emails. There were two major cash crunches, Yam testified: one in 2009, and another in 2013, when the cash position “started to get a bit tight, not to the extent of 2009,” but enough that Yam was sending updates to Holmes and Balwani on a weekly basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wECBIH"&gt;In 2013, Theranos was burning about $2 million a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjRX5m"&gt;In the financial statements for 2012, there is no line for revenue — because there was none. There’s none in 2013 either. This is not, in and of itself, especially damning, but it does paint a picture of a money-losing company on the ropes; by 2012, Theranos had lost $161 million over its lifetime, and it lost another $92 million in 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qLhnGz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not only did Yam not provide numbers for this, she didn’t know where these other numbers came from&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="reoHeC"&gt;In the course of working at Theranos, Yam consulted with Aranca, an analytics firm, to price stock options for Holmes and other employees. To do this, she consulted with Holmes, because Holmes had “the best information” about what financial projections to give to Aranca. In one email from Yam to Holmes, Yam asks to use numbers she’s previously used. Holmes writes back, estimating that 2015 revenue will be about $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpeD1K"&gt;This was all fine and sort of boring, until another document was introduced, one Yam hadn’t seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2qUdn"&gt;This document, Leach said, had been given to investors. It showed revenue projections of $140 million in revenue in 2015, and $990 million in 2016. Not only did Yam not provide numbers for this, she didn’t know where these other numbers came from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdDBIe"&gt;Look, &lt;em&gt;that’s weird.&lt;/em&gt; Let’s say you’re giving lower numbers to the people who price your stock options. That means that your options will be worth more if the higher numbers — the ones you gave to your investors — are right! On the other hand, let’s say those higher numbers you gave to your investors are wrong, and the lower numbers you used to price your shares are right. That, um, seems like maybe you lied to the investors in order to get their money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bf2rFI"&gt;The discrepancy here doesn’t establish intent — the government has to show that Holmes &lt;em&gt;knowingly lied&lt;/em&gt; — but it doesn’t look good. Which is probably why the defense counsel got up to talk about deferred revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="8IEOdP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theranos’ situation wasn’t as bad as it looked, Wade argued&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOcvgN"&gt;Lance Wade, Holmes’ lawyer, didn’t exactly &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; deferred revenue, which is the accounting world term for advance payments for goods or services that aren’t yet delivered. (If the goods or services aren’t delivered, a company may have to give that money back; deferred revenue shows up as a liability on the balance sheet until the work gets done.) In response to Wade’s questioning, Yam says she provided Sunny Balwani — Holmes’ co-defendant, being tried separately — with Theranos’ annual deferred revenue estimate: $169 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXWhuf"&gt;So Theranos’ situation wasn’t as bad as it looked, Wade argued: money was coming in from deals with Safeway and Walgreens and some other companies — Theranos just couldn’t mark it as revenue on its books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDr5DD"&gt;Okay, but what about the mismatched projections? Like, I’m not a math whiz, but $100 million, the 2015 projection given for stock option pricing, and $140 million, the 2015 projection given to investors, &lt;em&gt;are different numbers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMczSE"&gt;I didn’t hear anything satisfying to explain that. Wade instead made the argument that different accounting practices can lead to different outcomes — pointing to another part of the document the Aranca consultants had prepared for Theranos as proof. See, one way of valuing Theranos meant it was worth $1.9 billion; another way meant it was worth $9.5 billion. This is not quite the same thing as using different numbers when you’re speaking to different audiences, though!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qK0APW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theranos employees couldn’t list the company on their LinkedIn, or describe their responsibilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="33XbpR"&gt;After Yam stepped down, former Theranos lab associate Erika Cheung took the stand. She’d joined Theranos directly after UC Berkeley, and at first had been “starstruck” by Holmes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNuiAk"&gt;The secrecy started immediately, in the job interviews where neither Holmes nor Balwani would say exactly what Theranos did. Cheung was presented with a non-disclosure agreement on her very first day. Then, Holmes’ brother, Christian, made it clear that Theranos employees couldn’t list the company on their LinkedIn, or describe their responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmQhRs"&gt;Cheung was only at Theranos six months before she quit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PS85Nh"&gt;Before that, though, Cheung did work on validation, a series of experiments that were run to make sure the results were accurate and precise. Samples of Cheung’s own blood were run as part of validation testing. Though traditional methods showed she was in the normal range for vitamin D, Theranos’ machines consistently showed that she was deficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sva3Aa"&gt;Cheung also discussed a similar kind of testing that is used to calibrate equipment on a daily basis, quality control. As part of the process, you take a sample with results you already know, and run it through the machine. If the machine’s results don’t match the sample, you troubleshoot to see where things went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LHfqBh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It was a lot to throw at people all in one day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rht8EP"&gt;But Cheung’s testimony called into question how good the quality control was. She’d emailed an internal helpline because, despite troubleshooting her machine, she couldn’t get it to work properly for the vitamin D test. This chain is escalated to Balwani and Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6mCCQ"&gt;The problem was resolved, but not in a way Cheung was comfortable with. See, the vitamin D reading came from six data points, and to get the machine to pass quality control, two “outlier values” had to be discarded. That was when we broke for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuXfbp"&gt;Cheung did a better job than either the defense or prosecution lawyers at clearly explaining technical concepts, but even so, it was a lot to throw at people all in one day, &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; after the bickering over accounting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VCUrmO"&gt;Given the presumption of innocence and the standard of reasonable doubt, confusion works in Holmes’ favor. If the jurors get lost, it’s easier for Holmes to win — because if &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; can’t keep this all straight, then it might seem reasonable she wouldn’t have been able to, either. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7?</title>

  &lt;p id="ajPTaI"&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;big rumors heating up&lt;/a&gt; before Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;“California Streaming” iPhone announcement event&lt;/a&gt; about the Apple Watch Series 7 wound up fizzling out as soon as the new smartwatch was unveiled. The speculation was that Apple would perform the most significant overhaul of its smartwatch ever, aligning its design with that of the iPhone 12 and 13 — namely, flat sides and a more squared-off look with a larger display and smaller bezels. We got the larger display and slimmer bezels part, but the Apple Watch Series 7 still mostly looks like its predecessors at casual glance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sh7XXc"&gt;The biggest change to the Series 7 is indeed physically bigger: the display. Apple increased the screen sizes to 41mm and 45mm, and with a thicker glass top the display is stronger while stretching out further to the edges. The functional benefit is more room on the screen for larger icons, and Apple says you can do and see more with more info on screen and new watch faces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVz5af"&gt;Along with the screen changes, the Series 7 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;a bevy of typical year-over-year improvements&lt;/a&gt;, such as faster charging, improved durability, new workouts, new colors, and even a full swipe keyboard for fidgeting with some tiny letters on these larger screens. But even with all of that, the design feels conservative, and not a radical departure from its immediate forebears. So should you wait until Apple’s estimated “later this fall” timeframe for the Apple Watch Series 7, or do the Apple Watches of today offer enough as-is for you? &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7’s colors, including a green that seems vaguely black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="alRuHC"&gt;The outgoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; of 2020 is still an impressively capable smartwatch, and we’ve seen significant discounts on it for months now. The polarizing red colorway has at times plummeted as low as $249, even cheaper than the midrange $279 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; that lacks an always-on display. Right at this moment you can buy a Series 6 from a variety of retailers in a color of your choice for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=verge091421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$319&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$349&lt;/a&gt;, which is a considerable amount less than the $399 starting price of the Series 7 without having to wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWFRQe"&gt;Spending less right now becomes even more appealing when you consider the Series 7 may still be using last year’s S6 processor — if so, it probably won’t have an added year of OS updates over the Series 6 like you’d normally expect. One of the benefits of a new processor isn’t just the speedy improvements of today, but also the sustainability and reassurance offered down the road by an increased performance ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zhG-_eAoGQRSxsbWZoY6BmO67w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22850995/applewatch_series7_typing.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please don’t lie and tell me you look forward to typing on this screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5zlmpZ"&gt;The Series 7 certainly has its merits. If you prefer to have the most peace of mind, or you live a lifestyle that will really put a fitness-focused device to the test, then perhaps the new IP6X resistance rating for grittier environments and sandy beaches is enticing. If you value the fastest charging, the Series 7 comes with a USB-C magnetic fast charger, offering a 33 percent quicker charge, and even buying one of those separately will not juice up a prior generation watch any quicker. The larger displays are of course the biggest change, and if you always prefer what’s newer, bigger, and flashier then by all means keep an eye out for when preorders go up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRniGK"&gt;But this new Apple Watch still pretty much just looks like any old Apple Watch, especially at the distances people usually see a watch on someone’s wrist. What will matter most to you here might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22652375/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-phones-fashion"&gt;a very personal tech or fashion accessory decision&lt;/a&gt;, and if a slightly larger screen is all you need maybe that’s good enough. Though if you’re looking for the most sensible smartwatch from Apple, you may want to consider skipping the wait and choosing from the more cost-effective options available right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>xCloud and Xbox Remote Play are officially available on Windows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mq8TmdOlEUQF3U6AKfBelq9_YCA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69859247/Remote_Play_Key_Art.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o9ZusI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/14/new-updates-to-xbox-app-on-windows-10/"&gt;Microsoft has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its xCloud service, officially known as Xbox Cloud Gaming, and Xbox Remote Play are now available to everyone with the Xbox app on Windows 10 (or 11). These features on PC rolled out to Xbox Insiders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616774/microsoft-xcloud-windows-xbox-app-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta"&gt;as a beta last month&lt;/a&gt;, and have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524109/microsoft-xbox-app-iphone-ipad-game-streaming-xbox-app-microsoft-features"&gt;available on phones&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but them being officially available on PC is nice to see too. It’s giving you another option for how you want to play, whether the game is running on your personal console or Microsoft’s servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDD0go"&gt;Xbox Cloud Gaming, which seems like a natural fit for PCs that don’t have the power to run the games themselves, has been available on Windows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391561/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-xbox-game-streaming-beta-features"&gt;for a few months through web browsers&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s a nice step forward that the service is now in a native app, rather than being confined to a web browser on PC. Using it still requires a Bluetooth or USB controller, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. It’s also worth noting that while Xbox Cloud Gaming’s availability on Windows is no longer exclusive to Insiders, Microsoft is still labeling the service itself as a beta, so your mileage may vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qgAzuI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature may be out of beta, but the service isn’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjwgvl"&gt;Remote Play is also a nice addition, allowing you to stream games from an Xbox Series S or X, or Xbox One, to your Windows machine. Microsoft says the feature is available either on your home network or remotely over the internet, though you’ll likely get better performance if the game is running locally on the same network. Microsoft has added some features to Remote Play too: the company says that you can now stream games in 1080p 60fps, and that you’ll be able to play “select” games from the original Xbox and 360. We’ve asked Microsoft for a list of the games that will be supported and will provide an update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How the iPhone 13, Mini, Pro and Max compare to Android rivals — and vs. iPhone 12</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIE1fKsyU-4YGO8QCzzk9vf437c=/136x0:1525x926/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69858872/Screen_Shot_2021_09_14_at_1.41.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwYW5M"&gt;Apple has announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Mini,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666884/iphone-13-pro-max-specs-price-release-date-cameras"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;, which feature better cameras, 120Hz screens, new processors (which Apple claims are the fastest in a phone, period), better battery life, and smaller notches compared to their predecessors. But should you upgrade from the iPhone 12, and is Apple beating the Android competition? Here’s how Apple stacks up to Samsung, OnePlus, Google, and its own previous devices on paper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEx3AS"&gt;One thing to keep in mind before we dive in is that specs don’t tell the whole story. There’s the obvious difficult comparisons (how does an Apple A15 chip stack up against a Snapdragon 888, and how do you compare traditional phones to folding ones), as well as the small details that don’t fit cleanly on a spec sheet. For instance, one of Apple’s pro features is the ability to shoot 4K ProRes on its higher-end phones — except for the models with 128GB of storage, which will be limited to 1080p ProRes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kLycRm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Missing from this comparison: Google’s upcoming flagships&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLNb0o"&gt;There’s also an obvious competitor missing: Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google didn’t give us their full specifications &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;in its partial announcement&lt;/a&gt;, which makes it hard to include them in a spec comparison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdkPRY"&gt;But let’s put all those caveats aside, because maybe you’re looking for a phone &lt;em&gt;right now. &lt;/em&gt;How do the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini stack up, spec-for-spec, against their Android competitors? Prices throughout this comparison, by the way, are for the unlocked iPhones, which are $30 more than the carrier versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEaQyh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752933"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U16Rcu"&gt;Anyways, let’s stop talking about saving a few bucks, and blow the budget a bit: how does the iPhone 13 Pro stack up against the Android flagships, in a battle of the $1,000 plus phones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tbl3mx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10752940"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xtCxJu"&gt;As with past years, we see that Apple isn’t necessarily playing a spec-game, especially when it comes to cameras. Some of its higher-end Android competitors boast megapixel counts that are four or even almost 10 times as high as Apple’s cameras. Whether that’ll give them an edge or not will have to be seen when we test Apple’s “dramatically more powerful” cameras. Both Apple and Google have traditionally prioritized larger pixels for low-light performance rather than raw resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKBjqe"&gt;Finally, let’s take a look at how Apple did year-over-year when it comes to upgrading its specs. It’s worth noting that, while we’ve included the 12 Pro, you actually can’t buy that phone  from Apple anymore, making the comparison more useful for upgraders than cross-shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eKc9TA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10753324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUkaL0"&gt;One interesting point is that the phones haven’t changed when it comes to width, height, or screen size, but they have gotten a bit thicker, and a bit heavier. They are packing a fair amount of new tech though, so perhaps that’s understandable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HoaQL"&gt;What the specs don't show, though, is how unfavorably the iPhone 12 is priced — at first glance the it seems like a reasonable buy at $100 cheaper, but at that price you’re only getting half the storage. If you get a 128GB iPhone 12, you’ll only be saving $50 compared to the 128GB iPhone 13, which has all the upgrades to the screens, cameras, battery life, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666802/iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-apple-camera"&gt;everything else Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday. Sure, it’s technically less expensive, but you’d be giving up a lot for very little savings. &lt;/p&gt;
