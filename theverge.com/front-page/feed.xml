    <title>Ex-Google engineer Anthony Levandowski has closed his artificial intelligence church</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPxfhD"&gt;Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer convicted of stealing self-driving car secrets, is closing his artificial intelligence-focused church Way of the Future (WOTF), &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a somewhat inauspicious end to the church’s goal of pursuing “the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” in preparation for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"&gt;the Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. Now humanity will be left to deal with rampant AI without the religion’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3QDR"&gt;Levandowski started the process of shuttering WOTF in June 2020, according to documents filed in the state of California found by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. WOTF never had regular meetings or a physical church building. The church’s funds, totaling $175,172, have been donated to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tIEwP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Way of the Future is a thing of the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="83DlSm"&gt;Owning and operating an AI church is really just one piece of the larger Levandowski story, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has covered as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965974/uber-waymo-self-driving-car-lawsuit-news"&gt;the legal saga between Uber and Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. Levandowski worked on autonomous vehicles at Google, then started his own self-driving trucking company Otto, which he later sold to Uber. At some point in the journey from Google to Uber, Levandowski took some internal documents from the search giant, leading to Google suing Uber in 2017 and settling in 2018. Levandowski was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354906/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-lawsuit-sentence-18-months-prison-lawsuit"&gt;convicted of trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSrVBK"&gt;Levandowski was sentenced to a shortened 18 months in prison to be served following the pandemic, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240175/trump-pardons-anthony-levandowski-google-uber-waymo-trade-secrets"&gt;pardoned by former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; before he left office. With Way of the Future a thing of the past, no prison sentence to serve, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146339/anthony-levandowski-self-driving-car-cross-country-co-pilot-pronto-uber-waymo"&gt;another autonomous driving company&lt;/a&gt; to oversee, Levandowski seems like he can wait for AI to surpass humans in relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard Arcade Collection bundles three of the studio’s more obscure classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qa3vV4MWu_A6eJTXosFca9h92pA=/172x0:1749x1051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845484/Screenshot__156_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JQr7S"&gt;As part of BlizzCon Online’s opening ceremony, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new video game anthology that includes some of the earlier titles created by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer. &lt;a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/en-CA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a compilation featuring three titles developed by Blizzard around the early and mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH1OnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; includes &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, a puzzle platformer that was originally released on SNES in 1993, back when the studio was known as Silicon &amp;amp; Synapse. The game would also see previous ports on other consoles like the Amiga and Game Boy Advance, and was even made available on PC &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/3/5678044/the-lost-vikings-free-blizzard-deal"&gt;as a free download on Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF6V9D"&gt;The other games available include another platformer called &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne&lt;/em&gt;, which was released originally in 1994 on the SNES, as well as &lt;em&gt;Rock n’ Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, a vehicular combat racer. And just like &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings,&lt;/em&gt; both titles would make their way onto &lt;a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download?show=classic"&gt;Blizzard’s digital storefront as free titles&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and 2014, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgNnXt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Fighter icons Chun-Li and Ryu are joining Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYd8l2"&gt;Famous video game fighter Chun-Li may not be &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/who-forgot-to-invite-chun-li-to-the-mortal-kombat-1846300631"&gt;in the new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt;, but she and fellow &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; icon Ryu will be playable characters in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;soon. Both Chun-Li and Ryu will be available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game shop on Saturday, February 20th at 7PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1EWB9"&gt;Chun-Li and Ryu aren’t the first video game stars to appear in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this season — fans have also had the chance to pick up skins based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos from &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXE3H7"&gt;This entire season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been jam-packed with other crossovers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fortnitegame/status/1337245726477348865?lang=en"&gt;two characters from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;soccer kits from real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;even the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; (who is absolutely adorable in-game). And the game’s last season was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;huge Marvel-themed crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NhmWW"&gt;As unexpected as Chun-Li and Ryu’s arrivals may be, they’re just another reminder that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Audeze Penrose gaming headset nails almost everything except for comfort</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Great sound, full of features, but the fit might be a deal-breaker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SiQb3F"&gt;The Audeze Penrose has almost everything I want in a wireless gaming headset. Its high-end planar magnetic drivers deliver rich, balanced sound quality that’s easily superior to other models I’ve tested recently. It’s feature-packed, too, with individual volume and microphone levels, USB-C charging, the option for wired connectivity via 3.5mm, as well as support for simultaneous Bluetooth 5.0 audio connections. As a gaming headset, it’s stacked — which it should be for something that costs $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXjG6j"&gt;After reviewing a headset, I usually can’t wait to return to the familiar, plushy, warm-sounding cans of my own Sony WH-1000XM3, but the Penrose is a joy to listen to. Game audio sounds punchy without being over-delivered, I don’t need to blast the volume to hear subtle details, and even though this headset doesn’t have active noise cancellation, I was almost convinced it did due to a combined effort from its closed-back design and thick ear pads that yield better-than-average sound isolation. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qNNz9Hrb4jtaK6kZ_hvUzPfizE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275062/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition to 2.4GHz and Bluetooth, you can connect via 3.5mm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z8zGl9"&gt;The particular model that Audeze sent along for review is made to be compatible with PS4 and PS5 consoles and with PCs via its 2.4GHz wireless receiver. (It also works with the Nintendo Switch, even though that isn’t advertised.) It’s clad in black with blue trim to signify which family of consoles it was designed for. The company also makes an Xbox version called the Penrose X that has green trim, and that model’s unique receiver has a two-position toggle switch that lets it work with Microsoft’s proprietary wireless tech in one mode, then on PC in the other. Otherwise, it’s the same hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qgctql"&gt;There’s a caveat to all of this goodness: I didn’t find the Penrose to be comfortable to wear for even short gaming sessions. I never forgot that it was on my head because I felt squeezed the whole time, and that’s a deal-breaker for me. I should note that I have a somewhat large head, so it’s likely that people with smaller noggins won’t feel as compressed. But I imagine that its 320g weight would feel heavy on just about any noggin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pxKz7E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10315655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uwzqb6"&gt;Other recent headsets I’ve liked, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21519747/hyperx-cloud-ii-wireless-pc-gaming-headset-ps4-ps5-nintendo-switch-usbc-review-release-date-price"&gt;HyperX Cloud II Wireless&lt;/a&gt;, are 320g as well, but its weight is distributed much better. I barely notice that model on my head even after some time has passed, and that’s what I’m personally looking for in a headset. Granted, HyperX Cloud II doesn’t have hefty 100mm magnetic drivers like the Penrose does, which amounts to better sound at the expense of heavier ear cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7DXy4"&gt;I’d give Audeze more of a pass if the Penrose was an original design, but it’s almost identical to the $399 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17118960/audezes-mobius-headphones-gaming-3d-audio"&gt;Audeze Mobius&lt;/a&gt; released in 2018, which had enhanced 3D sound processing and head-tracking. (The Penrose lacks both features.) It also looks like the $299 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18171636/hyperx-cloud-orbit-gaming-headphones-planar-magnetic-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;HyperX Cloud Orbit released in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, which features Audeze’s planar magnetic drivers, and much of the Mobius’ design. The Penrose’s build quality is still exceptional, but I wish the company had put more focus on refining the design, particularly as it relates to comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BuHb_pwekMQ2d6QnzvrhmGq2I5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275059/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dials look easy to access, but they aren’t so simple to discern without looking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TrMLtb"&gt;As for the controls, the layout isn’t unintuitive, but some of the buttons don’t stand out enough when you’re feeling for them — specifically, the volume and mic level dials. Those are integrated into the backside of the left ear cup, and they’re raised, as opposed to being built flush into the ear cup, to make feeling for them easier (at least, that seems like the goal). Those raised hunks of plastic actually make the thin dials tough to discern and adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9A5xe0"&gt;Otherwise, it’s easy to take advantage of the Penrose’s main features, like being able to mute the mic with the switch on the left ear cup’s outer shell, or switching wireless modes with the multifunction button near where the detachable mic plugs in. The Penrose isn’t the only headset that lets you connect to a phone via Bluetooth while also being connected to your game console, but I think the execution here is great. If you get a call while you’re gaming, tapping the Penrose’s power button will pick up or hang up. (Careful, though: Audeze says your voice will be transmitted over both Bluetooth and wireless channels.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvOpfF"&gt;Battery life is lackluster. I’ve gotten around 10 hours of use per charge, whereas some less expensive competing models in our headset buying guide offer 30 or more hours per charge. It’s not great considering the price, but it’s not a huge issue for me since I usually leave my headset at my PC or PS5 charging overnight anyway (made easier by the reversible USB-C port).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Audeze Penrose" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6_9U36Qf_BPATpxodGu3W0L3GQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22275063/cfaulkner_210128_4394_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wireless receiver is shaped like a thumb drive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8IVNi7"&gt;It’s easy for me to recommend the Penrose based on its features and sound quality alone, but comfort plays an equally large role for me — and that’s where this headset is lacking the most. It’s a shame that the fit is so fatiguing because it’s really the only deal-breaker. Otherwise, the Penrose could be an ideal addition to any gamer’s life, especially those who want a headset that can connect to multiple devices simultaneously. Just heed the warning that, for certain head shapes and for people sensitive to wearing hefty headphones, it might not fit your head very well. &lt;/p&gt;

We regret this error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After firing a top AI ethicist, Google is changing its diversity and research policies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSRf0P6uBYYVaSFtyuAFFg84kZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845027/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IztY5Z"&gt;Google is changing its policies related to research and diversity after completing an internal investigation into the firing of ethical AI team co-leader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company intends to tie the pay of certain executives to diversity and inclusivity goals. It’s also making changes to how sensitive employee exits are managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ky9MHl"&gt;Although Google did not reveal the results of the investigation, the changes seem to be direct responses to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;how the situation with Gebru went down&lt;/a&gt;. After Google demanded that a paper she co-authored be retracted, Gebru told research team management that she would resign from her position and work on a transition plan, unless certain conditions were met. Instead of a transition plan, the company immediately ended her employment while she was on vacation. This sparked backlash from members of her team, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266513/google-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing"&gt;caused some Google engineers to quit in protest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meaLAL"&gt;Google had claimed that Gebru’s paper was not submitted properly, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;though the research team disagreed&lt;/a&gt;. Google has now said it will “streamline its process for publishing research,” according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, but the exact details of the policy changes weren’t given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9aTdW"&gt;In an internal email to staff, Jeff Dean, head of AI at Google, wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kpD1tF"&gt; I heard and acknowledge what Dr. Gebru’s exit signified to female technologists, to those in the Black community and other underrepresented groups who are pursuing careers in tech, and to many who care deeply about Google’s responsible use of AI. It led some to question their place here, which I regret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wr1cPJ"&gt;He also apologized for how Gebru’s exit was handled, although he stopped short of calling it a firing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUunXx"&gt;The policy changes come a day &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;after Google restructured its AI teams&lt;/a&gt;, a change which members of the ethical AI team were “the last to know about,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhanna/status/1362476196693303297"&gt;according to research scientist Alex Hanna&lt;/a&gt;, who is a part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODC3Md"&gt;Google declined to share the updated policies with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, instead pointing to &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-tweaks-diversity-research-policies-following-inquiry-8baa6346-d2a2-456f-9743-7912e4659ca2.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; for details. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s DOTA 2 anime gets a proper teaser trailer full of dragon-fighting action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u45WCZA2dE4CNrA6b3WtBNX3OI4=/307x0:2164x1238/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844778/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_3.16.29_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IThYjh"&gt;It’s only been a few days since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286539/netflix-valve-dota-2-anime-series-dota-dragons-blood"&gt;Netflix announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was working on an anime series based on &lt;em&gt;DOTA 2&lt;/em&gt; — &lt;em&gt;DOTA: Dragon’s Blood — &lt;/em&gt;but in that time, the streamer has already released a proper teaser trailer that actually shows off the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3rxA3"&gt;And while the original announcement from earlier in the week showed off just &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM-NqFX2jU8"&gt;a few seconds of footage&lt;/a&gt;, the new trailer is just that — a full-fledged teaser for the series that shows off characters like Davion, the Dragon Knight whose quest will be at the heart of the show, and Princess Mirana (&lt;em&gt;DOTA 2 &lt;/em&gt;players will likely recognize both of those names as heroes playable in the popular online game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMcG8M"&gt;The release of a new trailer this soon makes a certain amount of sense, though, given how little time there’s going to be between the show’s announcement and its release on March 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZJACe"&gt;As previously announced, &lt;em&gt;DOTA: Dragon’s Blood &lt;/em&gt;will be produced&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;by Studio MIR, the group behind &lt;em&gt;Legend of Korra &lt;/em&gt;and Netflix’s&lt;em&gt; Voltron: Legendary Defender, &lt;/em&gt;with Ashley Edward Miller (co-writer on &lt;em&gt;X-Men: First Class &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Thor&lt;/em&gt;) serving as showrunner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="83ZUDX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good lord, my cast. I’ll have much more to say in the next few days but for now let me drop some names on you… &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YuriLowenthal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YuriLowenthal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/larapulver?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@larapulver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TonyTodd54?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TonyTodd54&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TroyBakerVA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TroyBakerVA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AustralianFreya?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AustralianFreya&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlixWiltonRegan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AlixWiltonRegan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KariWahlgren?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@KariWahlgren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sjacobsen22?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@sjacobsen22&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ansonmount?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ansonmount&lt;/a&gt; … their acting on DOTA is just phenomenal. &lt;a href="https://t.co/SoB885HEnd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SoB885HEnd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ashley Edward Miller (@ashmasterzero) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ashmasterzero/status/1362061285358063617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wv4iEB"&gt;Miller has also started teasing some of the series’ cast on Twitter, revealing earlier in the week that the show will feature a mix of popular video game voice actors like Yuri Lowenthal, Troy Baker, Alix Wilton Regan, and Kari Wahlgren — fitting, given the franchise’s gaming pedigree — alongside more traditional film and TV actors like Lara Pulver (&lt;em&gt;Sherlock&lt;/em&gt;), Tony Todd (&lt;em&gt;Candyman&lt;/em&gt;), Anson Mount (&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;), and Freya Tingley (&lt;em&gt;Once Upon A Time&lt;/em&gt;.) More details on the cast and show should also arrive before it releases next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart, Uber, Lyft, Postmates, and DoorDash totally conned you into paying for Prop 22</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Instacart" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPPQmgTZj9wo0Y1ZVeYnJTdOFgE=/0x2:5194x3465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844745/1147794851.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection / Gado / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dERsNh"&gt;Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart, and Postmates spent over $200 million campaigning for Proposition 22, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;the most expensive ballot measure in California history&lt;/a&gt;, successfully convincing voters that they couldn’t properly pay and protect their workers if they were forced to classify them as full employees — at least, not without cutting back service or substantially raising the price you’d pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="03nbJ8"&gt;But now the dust has settled, &lt;em&gt;every single gig economy company&lt;/em&gt; that backed Prop 22 has raised those prices anyway. &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Instacart-is-raising-prices-for-its-California-15961886.php#:~:text=Customers%20will%20now%20pay%20an,pay%20%248%20instead%20of%20%245."&gt;Instacart was the last to join the bait-and-switch today,&lt;/a&gt; according to the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;’s Carolyn Said&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; who &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Here-s-what-you-re-paying-for-Prop-22-15870617.php"&gt;previously told us in January&lt;/a&gt; exactly how much some of these companies are charging Californians to pay for worker benefits: $1-$2 per meal with Uber, $1.50 with Grubhub, up to $1.50 per ride with Lyft, and a whole additional 3 percent increase per order with Instacart (for a total of 8 percent, though it doesn’t apply to the company’s “Express” subscription plan yet). Postmates is charging &lt;a href="https://sf.eater.com/2021/1/20/22240818/postmates-delivery-fees-prop-22"&gt;as much as $2.50 extra per order&lt;/a&gt;, our sister site &lt;em&gt;Eater&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a9HW9A"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instacart threatened price increases if they lost Prop 22.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that they won, they're raising them anyway.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gig corporations have no shame.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We cannot let them roll this horrible law out to other States. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FAF9LJ91yA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FAF9LJ91yA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gig Workers Rising (@GigWorkersRise) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GigWorkersRise/status/1362804941153210370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NABuAY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instead of paying their workers, gig corporations pumped  $200M to pass prop 22, claiming the worker protections guaranteed under the law would force them to drive up cost &amp;amp; pass it on to customers. Well guess what? They did it anyways. It's honestly disgusting at this point. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tMH2jBjWPE"&gt;https://t.co/tMH2jBjWPE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— California Labor Federation (@CaliforniaLabor) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaliforniaLabor/status/1338588542004391936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZUmEb3"&gt;Just to be clear, these companies explicitly pushed voters into supporting Prop 22 to &lt;em&gt;avoid&lt;/em&gt; higher prices. Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-fares-double-small-cities-if-voters-reject-prop-22-2020-10#:~:text=%22The%20vast%20majority%20of%20our,on%20what%20city%20you%20are.%22"&gt;publicly said&lt;/a&gt; prices would increase between 20 and 40 percent in big California cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, and up to double in smaller towns. &lt;a href="https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/22/arguments-rebuttals.htm"&gt;In California’s official Voter Guide&lt;/a&gt;, which accompanied mail-in ballots, supporters of the bill warned there would be “significantly higher consumer prices” if Prop 22 failed to pass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s3Cov8"&gt;Companies like Uber and Lyft succeeded in part due to those scare tactics, and by appealing to voters that they could help workers get more protections and higher pay this way instead of potentially putting those workers’ jobs at risk. (It probably didn’t hurt that the app companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;bombarded both drivers and passengers with messages using their own apps&lt;/a&gt;, which triggered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21529082/uber-drivers-lawsuit-prop-22-alerts-california-gig-workers"&gt;a lawsuit from drivers&lt;/a&gt; who claimed Uber was bullying them.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0WTiPZ"&gt;But there’s still an open question whether Prop 22 is actually helping workers, regardless of how much more we’re paying to supposedly make that happen. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/18/uber-lyft-doordash-prop-22-drivers-california"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that some drivers claim pay has actually fallen and the job has become less reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZJsp1"&gt;In the UK, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/21330906/uber-uk-supreme-court-employee-rights"&gt;Uber just lost a five-year legal battle today&lt;/a&gt; over a similar issue, which will give workers there a guaranteed minimum wage, paid holiday, and other protections (though they will not necessarily be “employees”). But here in the US where Prop 22 succeeded, it’s opened the door for other parts of the country to potentially replace many regular employees with contractors too. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has a good piece &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288488/prop-22-gig-economy-expansion-industries-bloomberg"&gt;you should read&lt;/a&gt; about what that future might look like, for better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover beams back first images from its wild landing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TYnDsMsqMRcMT77GSLlmPhaEjfM=/0x86:2048x1451/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844524/Eum6fRMVIAENjK1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first image showing Perseverance being lowered to the Martian surface by its rocket-powered Skycrane.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wcHhYh"&gt;NASA just released a cache of tantalizing photos from its Perseverance rover after landing on Mars Thursday, with one showing the rover getting dropped off by the rocket-powered platform it used to gently descend on the Red Planet’s surface. Scientists are poring through hundreds of images and expect to release more — including videos  and audio — in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W1BrUbe1tqbxJIaZSJLk99AnssA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315624/Color.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first color image taken by Perseverance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xDfgnH"&gt;The SUV-sized Perseverance rover touched down at Mars’ Jezero crater at 3:55PM ET on Thursday, surviving a seven-month journey from Earth and a blazing hot, seven-minute plunge through the Martian atmosphere. A jetpack called Skycrane gently lowered Perseverance to the ground on a set of cables from 66 feet above the surface, and took a picture of the process. Once it landed, the rover then began snapping its own photos and beaming them back to Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F4CJoC"&gt;The number of photos from Perseverance so far is “more than I can count... a higher number than I can say on my hand,” Pauline Hwang, assistant strategic mission manager, said at a press conference on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2zyy6"&gt;Getting them back, she said, “was exhilarating, the team went wild ... The scientists immediately just started looking at all those rocks and zooming in.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Siyr2Y60Pud9VAr92LtLl0PVrL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315632/Wheel.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of Perseverance’s front right wheel, showing rocks in the background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ik8Rc2"&gt;The photos already have scientists asking a slew of questions about Mars’ geology. One photo of the rover’s front right wheel shows in the background a few Martian rocks perforated with tiny holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qy1vsl"&gt;“Depending on what the origins of these rocks is, the holes can mean different things,” Katie Morgan, the mission’s deputy project scientist, said. If the holes are of a volcanic origin, they could be tiny vessels left over from gases that escaped, called “vesicles.” If they’re sedimentary rocks, the holes could signal that they were shaped by a fluid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3svip"&gt;“Really, we have to get our instruments out and look at these textures in fine detail to really help us make that determination,” Morgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2jVtpr"&gt;One of those instruments is called SuperCam, which sticks out of the top of the rover and looks like Perseverance’s robot head. SuperCam will target Martian rocks, zap them with a laser beam, and analyze the cloud of vapor it creates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8Gv9CworIzOzRrs2iuY__yR7ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315635/MRO.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: NASA/JPL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows Perseverance descending under its parachute moments before landing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bSscpt"&gt;Another image NASA released on Friday was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, a geology satellite circling Mars, showing Perseverance descending through the atmosphere under its parachute moments before touching down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zioI2D"&gt;Adam Steltzner, Perseverance’s chief engineer, likened the trove of Martian images from the rover to the iconic first shots taken on the moon in the ’60s, and the first image of Saturn that “brought to life the experience of space exploration,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rPkByf"&gt;“How many people were brought into the act of exploring space by these fantastic, iconic images?” Steltzner said at the press conference. “Well, we can only hope in our efforts to engineer spacecraft and explore our solar system that we might be able to someday contribute yet another iconic image to this collection.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Australia’s ABC News shot to the top of the App Store charts following Facebook’s news ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yb82vmdANKzGW2j2LQPDDeuIAa4=/233x522:1793x1562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68844399/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_8.51.34_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ABC News&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6m0UT"&gt;The Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s ABC News app shot to the top of Apple’s App Store charts in Australia over the course of the last few days, not long after Facebook banned Australian news sources on its platform. As &lt;em&gt;Financial Times’ &lt;/em&gt;Uma Patel suggests &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/umabp/status/1362714384368361477?s=20"&gt;in a tweet thread&lt;/a&gt;, that’s possibly because ABC capitalized on Facebook’s news ban with an ad sending users to its app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj4g75"&gt;ABC News currently sits at No. 2 in the App Store’s overall app rankings in Australia, according to the analytics firm &lt;a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/"&gt;App Annie&lt;/a&gt;, and No. 1 in the news app charts. When Patel noticed the change, the app was also briefly No. 1 overall, ahead of Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and the Facebook app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qFkBnJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;ABC has used facebook's ban to prompt visitors to download its app.. it became the most downloaded app in Australia.... although the next four are all owned by Facebook and the 6th is a company fb tried to buy &lt;a href="https://t.co/jGxeXYxv6x"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jGxeXYxv6x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Uma Patel (@umabp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/umabp/status/1362714384368361477?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MDiF39"&gt;Facebook’s ban was in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;an expansive Australian regulatory measure&lt;/a&gt; that will force tech platforms to pay Australian media companies for the content users share (and that platforms earn ad revenue from). Facebook took issue with the change and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;prohibited Australian news and media organizations&lt;/a&gt; from sharing news posts, and Australian users from seeing news from international sources as well. The ban also seemed to accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288256/facebook-australia-news-ban-governmental-agency-accounts"&gt;wipe out the posts&lt;/a&gt; from government pages and some other sites.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ABC News’ banner ad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YJubEU"&gt;Facebook’s ban dramatically shrunk the audience for some Australian news outlets, sending traffic down 93 percent the day after the ban was put in place, &lt;a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2021/02/in-australia-facebooks-ban-on-sharing-news-stories-has-sent-publishers-traffic-tumbling/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;NiemanLab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But ABC News responded by &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news"&gt;adding a banner&lt;/a&gt; to its home page. “Missing our news on Facebook?&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Get the latest news and live notifications with the ABC News app,” it reads. Since then, the app has risen from the high 400s to its current spot at No. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rV0MZe"&gt;Whatever the reason, readers heading directly to news sources over the social media sites that cannibalize them seems like a positive, and other news organizations could potentially take advantage of the ban in similar ways. It’s an unintended effect of Facebook’s hardline approach compared to its competitor Google, which struck a partnership deal with three of Australia’s largest media companies — &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/google-australia-news-technology-seven-west-media-2021-2#:~:text=Google%20signed%20up%20a%20major,force%20payments%20to%20media%20outlets."&gt;Seven West Media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/nine-agrees-to-join-google-news-showcase-in-australia-for-reported-30m-a-year#:~:text=Australia's%20biggest%20locally%2Downed%20media,laws%20being%20debated%20in%20parliament."&gt;Nine Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/17/news-corp-agrees-deal-with-google-over-payments-for-journalism"&gt;NewsCorp&lt;/a&gt; — for its News Showcase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Texas’ blackouts may come at a steep cost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-WEATHER-CONSERVATION-ENERGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5FtbZb2OBev8RGEU_KNEUQqYkSU=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843895/1231249302.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XPxA7A"&gt;As the lights begin to turn back on after nearly a week of outages across Texas, residents who already struggled to pay their utility bills might find it harder to recover. Costs are piling up that could continue to limit some people’s access to heating and electricity even after blackouts end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zE4HAt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The ‘heat or eat dilemma’ is a really, really significant issue.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HJeuZ"&gt;“The ‘heat or eat dilemma’ is a really, really significant issue,” says Emily Grubert, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology. “We know that a lot of people are going to basically be choosing between paying for heating or paying for other things that they really need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYzlBR"&gt;Indoor temperatures are likely to have dropped more sharply in homes that are less insulated against the elements. When heat is restored, it will cost more to warm those homes back up to bearable conditions. Some Texans might face higher bills as a result, which will take a greater toll on folks who routinely sacrifice paying for food or medicine in order to keep the power on in their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvFGQ0"&gt;Images of ridiculously high energy bills are already making the rounds on social media. That’s because wholesale electricity costs &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-electricity-texas-prices/texas-wholesale-electric-prices-spike-more-than-10000-amid-outages-idUSKBN2AF19A"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt; amid weather-induced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287130/texas-natural-gas-production-power-outages-frozen"&gt;fuel shortages&lt;/a&gt;. Prices rose from roughly $50 per megawatt-hour to more than $9,000 per megawatt-hour on February 15th, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). As a result, Texans who opted into wholesale prices, which are typically pretty low, &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/griddy-power-retailer-electricity-prices-texas-price-protection-grid/10350120/"&gt;saw an astounding increase&lt;/a&gt; in their utility bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h7asNZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When your electric company tells you to switch but there has been a hold on switching for over  a week now. Using as little as possible 1300 sq ft house and this is my bill. . How is this fair. I only paid $1200 for the whole 2020 year  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@FoxNews&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wfaa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wfaa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@tedcruz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GovAbbott?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GovAbbott&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AylTS4m0j4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AylTS4m0j4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— kat and tony (@katandtonyT) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/katandtonyT/status/1362460057447849987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdnkYy"&gt;A very low percentage of Texans are subject to that swing in wholesale prices, according to Joshua Rhodes, a research associate at The University of Texas at Austin. Most people buy their electricity from providers with fixed rates that will stay relatively stable. Even so, they could be in for some sticker shock when their next bill arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BKm8G2"&gt;The lucky people who’ve had power this week will face the cost of maintaining heat in their homes during the frigid temperatures. Those who lost power will have to pay to reheat their ice-cold homes. For each degree you turn up the heat, costs typically rise about &lt;a href="http://www.sleca.com/pdf/winterbrochure.pdf"&gt;3 percent&lt;/a&gt;. With temperatures well below freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit) in many homes, it will take a lot of energy to reach a comfortable 68 degrees. That could mean &lt;a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/money/business/right-on-the-money/how-will-my-electric-bill-impact-change-lost-power-or-not-texans-higher-bills-cost/287-697e9eb7-631f-4bf3-9fdb-9b06627405e1"&gt;higher-than-normal bills&lt;/a&gt; for people, even if they lost power this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nBPfbg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Higher-than-normal bills for people, even if they lost power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaYFKp"&gt;The outages also triggered other costly problems for Texans, which could lead some families to make hard decisions about what they can afford as disaster-related expenses mount. Homes across the state are now dealing with flooding and water damage from &lt;a href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/local/north-texas-water-pipes-bursting-expected-to-get-worse-what-to-do/287-c739f1f7-2bbd-41ed-abb1-d6e505e23787"&gt;frozen pipes that burst&lt;/a&gt;. And there are concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS895US895&amp;amp;ei=Z-kvYOOdGu7D_Qaxkrf4CA&amp;amp;q=price+gouging+texas&amp;amp;oq=price+gouging+texas&amp;amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEMQCMgUIABDEAjIFCAAQxAIyBAgAEAMyBAgAEAMyAggAMgQIABADMgIIADIGCAAQFhAeMgYIABAWEB46BwgAEEcQsAM6DgguEMcBEKMCEJECEJMCOgQIABBDOgUIABCxAzoICAAQsQMQgwE6BQgAEJECOgIILjoICC4QsQMQgwE6DgguEMcBEK8BEJECEJMCOgcILhCxAxBDOgUILhCxAzoKCAAQsQMQgwEQQzoICAAQsQMQyQM6CwguELEDEMcBEKMCOgoIABCxAxCDARAKOg0IABCxAxCDARDJAxAKOgUIABCSAzoGCAAQChADOgQIABAKOgsIABCxAxCDARDJA1CG1i1YqvgtYJ_5LWgJcAF4AYAB9gGIAYIQkgEGMjIuMS4xmAEAoAEBqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBCMABAQ&amp;amp;sclient=gws-wiz&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwij7dmZsfbuAhXuYd8KHTHJDY8Q4dUDCA0&amp;amp;uact=5"&gt;price gouging&lt;/a&gt; as water and food supplies in stores run low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QOPnE"&gt;“People are going to have to make really tough choices about where they’re investing their resources,” says Dana Harmon, executive director of the nonprofit Texas Energy Poverty Research Institute (TEPRI). “Part of what this is showing us is how incredibly interconnected, our food, water, and energy systems are.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJfJU9"&gt;The “heat or eat” dilemma was already a problem before the freeze arrived: 29 percent of residents surveyed by TEPRI said they delayed or skipped spending on food in order to pay for energy bills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9rWsZ"&gt;And this isn’t limited to Texas. Prior to the pandemic, 1 in 3 households in the US struggled to pay their energy bills, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/reports/2015/energybills/"&gt;US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt;. As people lost incomes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the problem grew: 4.8 million Americans were unable to pay at least one energy bill last year and received a disconnection notice from their utility company, a &lt;a href="https://oneill.indiana.edu/news/01182021-carley-konisky.html"&gt;recent study&lt;/a&gt; from Indiana University Bloomington found. Black and Hispanic households were more likely to have their service disconnected than white households. People who need electronic medical devices and people living in inefficient homes with poor insulation were also more likely to struggle to pay their utility bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Njq18Z"&gt;“The usual social and economic and racial injustices in our society are just getting magnified all over again when you have this freezing horrible cold weather that Texas isn’t designed for,” says Basav Sen, climate policy project director at the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kegG4E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Who pays for that? The customers right?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zZnXsL"&gt;There’s a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288292/texas-grid-upgrade-disaster-planning-power-outage-energy-crisis"&gt;work that needs to be done&lt;/a&gt; to prevent another energy crisis like the one that devastated Texas this week. There are mounting calls to upgrade the state’s grid to make it more resilient to weather extremes, including heatwaves, that are becoming more prevalent because of climate change. Those changes will be expensive, and experts are already worried that they will hurt people already feeling the squeeze of high energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HhgcUd"&gt;“Who pays for that? The customers right?” says Tony Reames, director of the Urban Energy Justice Lab at the University of Michigan. “We will likely see increases in utility bills as utilities try to recover the cost of whatever improvements they make to the infrastructure after this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4cSel7"&gt;Low-income households in Texas already spend about 10 percent of their incomes, on average, on energy, according to TEPRI. That’s compared to 2 percent for homes with higher incomes. Anything above 6 percent is already considered unaffordable, according to the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Bm1Eo"&gt;Keeping the lights on for everybody — disaster or not — might require rethinking the way we treat energy, says Reames. “Energy is a basic right and so instead of treating it like a commodity, how can we think about it as something that people should have access to?” he says. “Especially when they need it the most.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vi1Uk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXyRW0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
