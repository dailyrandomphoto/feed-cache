    <title>The best features of iOS, iPadOS, and macOS that Apple didn’t announce onstage</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RtIW8Ta8Q5MlQo_Rx191AoHx8Q=/0x0:1688x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433094/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He didn’t tell you everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zj7aSW"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22461782/apple-wwdc-2021-recap-biggest-announcements-ios-15-macos-monterey-ipados"&gt;had its WWDC keynote on Monday&lt;/a&gt;, where it showed off the big new features coming to its platforms, but it didn’t have time to show off everything coming to the new versions of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fios-15-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fipados%2Fipados-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F10%2F22526451%2Fiphone-ipad-mac-apple-watch-wwdc-best-features-ios-monterey" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;macOS&lt;/a&gt;. So we’ve combed through the preview pages, Twitter, and a good chunk of the internet to see what interesting features got left out of the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="sHaPRg"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 15&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="kLQeaU"&gt;The big features in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;iPadOS&lt;/a&gt; were the updates to notifications, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522904/apple-shareplay-facetime-music-hulu-videos-tiktok-wwdc"&gt;FaceTime&lt;/a&gt;, and multitasking, but it appears Apple may have been really focusing on the platforms themselves, too. There are a ton of quality-of-life improvements including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="y7L83k"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-brings-new-memoji-customization-with-over-40-outfits-accessibility-options-more/"&gt;More Memoji options&lt;/a&gt; with new outfits and accessibility options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vlFH2t"&gt;FaceTime will let you know when you’re muted but trying to talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DHMxjY"&gt;FaceTime will also let you zoom with the back camera so you can finally show people things across the room without standing up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0xauwK"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210406"&gt;Announce Messages feature&lt;/a&gt; found in AirPods is &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/08/carplay-in-ios-15-announce-messages-with-siri-driving-focus-customization-new-wallpapers/"&gt;coming to CarPlay&lt;/a&gt;, so your phone can automatically read texts out loud while you’re driving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2fXplS"&gt;Wary iPhone users will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/apple-will-let-users-stay-on-ios-14-and-receive-security-updates-even-after-ios-15-is-released/"&gt;put off upgrading to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; but still get security updates. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EFDRkR"&gt;Find My will be able to &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-find-my-network-can-find-your-iphone-when-it-is-powered-off/"&gt;track your iPhone when it’s off&lt;/a&gt; (or even after it’s been factory reset). It’s currently unclear what phones will support this feature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="95Co4f"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?s=21"&gt;improved print dialog with more options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="O3hVw7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It looks like iOS 15 is dramatically beefing up the print panel — finally &lt;a href="https://t.co/uXaflPoMPe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uXaflPoMPe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1402000042316210184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FqXAF0"&gt;You’ll get &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-icloud-storage-temporary-expansion/"&gt;free temporary iCloud storage&lt;/a&gt; when you transfer to a new device, but it will only last for three weeks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FfNAc8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-maps-leaving-arrival-times/"&gt;Leaving and arrival times are coming to Apple Maps&lt;/a&gt;, letting you better plan trips in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RDpJIc"&gt;iPhone apps for iPad &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ipados-15-enables-iphone-apps-in-landscape-mode-for-ipad-users/"&gt;will be able to run in landscape&lt;/a&gt;. No more flipping your iPad around when you need to check the one app that is still iPhone only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PcJTi8"&gt;There will be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjonesy/status/1401979104975540229?s=20"&gt;push notifications to tell you when it’s going to rain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O0ac5f"&gt;You’ll have the ability to schedule HomeKit devices with Siri (for example, asking it to turn on your bedroom lights at 7PM).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hsSOq5"&gt;Safari is getting the pull-to-refresh mechanism found in Mail and many social network apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lTaCMT"&gt;Accessibility settings like text size and contrast will be able to be set on a per-app basis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qAUK9S"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSig/status/1402002152176893954?s=20"&gt;EXIF data&lt;/a&gt; will be available in Photos, including camera and lens info.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KlHvzQ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bzamayo/status/1402008820847681536"&gt;You’ll also be able to adjust a photo’s date and time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TlxFLO"&gt;There’s a &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-apple-tv-remote-photos-more/"&gt;redesigned software Apple TV remote&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;new hardware version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="EihJ7m"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New Apple TV remote interface on iPhone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WWDC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/QQJLi1gNl6"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QQJLi1gNl6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Wilson  (@Wilson_boi_101) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wilson_boi_101/status/1402052171739238418?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OP1kBm"&gt;Panoramas taken on iPhone 12s should have less distortion, and moving subjects should look better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u4XNKR"&gt;You’ll be able to suggest to Photos that &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/09/ios-15-photos-now-lets-you-mark-people-places-and-dates-to-suggest-less-often-as-featured-images/"&gt;specific subjects shouldn’t show up&lt;/a&gt; in places like the Photos widget or Memories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bhb6cg"&gt;Spotlight will be accessible from the lock screen and Notification Center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BzNLM6"&gt;Filtering for spam texts... &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15s-new-sms-spam-filtering-feature-is-limited-to-brazil-heres-why/"&gt;if you live in Brazil, that is&lt;/a&gt;. It’s likely rolling out there because of rampant spamming of SMS in the country — India &lt;a href="https://english.jagran.com/technology/ios-14-6-amazing-indiaspecific-features-that-will-give-your-iphone-a-desi-touch-10016836"&gt;got the feature last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5Us6c4"&gt;You’ll be able to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1401999674899419143?s=20"&gt;drag and drop files&lt;/a&gt; across apps on iPhone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="NW7x6z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Using cross-app drag and drop on iPhone in iOS 15. Finally   &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WWDC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1RbyPBGfcq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1RbyPBGfcq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Federico Viticci (@viticci) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1401999674899419143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QH7fzN"&gt;Spanish speakers will be able to choose whether their devices refer to them using masculine, feminine, or neutral words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YvI4La"&gt;Mail is getting a widget, and there’s also a widget to show you how poorly you slept.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dovXS1"&gt;iPads are getting the ability to tab through text fields and buttons in apps, as can be done with Macs and in Safari.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkDWeM"&gt;iPads will support eye-tracking hardware to improve accessibility by letting people control a cursor using just their eyes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YXGdxJAma4n1f-mA9noGM0NiDPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22648627/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="oNzzVp"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="NownQt"&gt;The Monterey portion of the keynote was dominated by an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523322/apple-wwdc-impressive-drag-and-drop-universal-control-demo"&gt;incredibly impressive demo&lt;/a&gt; that showed off Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22523613/macos-monterey-wwdc-apple-ipad"&gt;Universal Control feature&lt;/a&gt;, but Apple also took the time to discuss Shortcuts, which are coming to macOS. Macs are complex machines, though, and there are a few more fun and useful things that will be coming in the fall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="nmoqSf"&gt;The ability to use your Memoji &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402433116959084545?s=20"&gt;as your user profile picture&lt;/a&gt; (it’ll even shake its head if you try to log in with the wrong password). &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="2b6QvW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/5YcMBxrb25"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5YcMBxrb25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Daniel Yount (@dyountmusic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dyountmusic/status/1402460588165435394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FjOpT8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-macos-monterey-privacy-features/"&gt;software microphone indicator light&lt;/a&gt; in the menu to show when an application is listening to you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YkP81U"&gt;A better file copy interface, with the ability to pause and resume transfers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8EPT75"&gt;The easy ability to &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-erase-all-content-settings/"&gt;erase user data, settings, and apps&lt;/a&gt; without re-installing the OS (great for if you’re selling your Mac)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BkvwPu"&gt;The ability to manage your saved passwords in System Preferences. You can also import them from other password managers or export them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KDTUWY"&gt;You can customize the mouse cursor’s outline and fill color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KvxtEv"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-automatic-window-resizing/"&gt;Windows will resize&lt;/a&gt; when you move them to another monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oNmXPz"&gt;Shortcuts will let you integrate shell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FE5yGR"&gt;An improved Go To Folder dialog in Finder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWjwsfwk1AQ4BA3fbd3-SuYkPPI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643104/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_6.22.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="E62K7I"&gt;And everything coming to... everything&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="uPCoCx"&gt;Of course, Apple is running an &lt;em&gt;ecosystem&lt;/em&gt; here, so many of the features that got announced will be coming to all of its computers. Here are a few more that will also be coming to iPhones, iPads, and Macs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z0zH2z"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/07/ios-15-ipados-15-and-macos-monterey-gain-built-in-two-factor-code-generator-and-autofill/"&gt;A built-in one-time password generator&lt;/a&gt;, similar to Google Authenticator or Authy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="spmEQM"&gt;Safari will detect if websites can support HTTPS and will automatically use it if they do (similar to the HTTPS Everywhere extension).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hXX12H"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/macos-monterey-low-power-mode/"&gt;A low power mode&lt;/a&gt; for macOS and iPad (I can’t wait to see how far I can stretch an M1 MacBook Pro)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtN5pt"&gt;Reminders are also getting a tags feature, similar to the one found in Notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="THeoMs"&gt;The Photos info pane will tell you about what Visual Look Up sees in the picture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZdmzFX"&gt;The ability to turn on DownTime whenever, if you really need to focus on something&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FhPxUi"&gt;An extension for Edge on Windows that lets you use your iCloud Passwords&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tfdVWLoOXSu2H8CfebLsVTOgAMU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643282/lcimg_13fd8fbd_fc86_4ecd_bfd1_7d9df4b29e09.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h1 id="RTxMUm"&gt;Wait, you forgot WatchOS 8!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="3W4Tbk"&gt;Well, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;showed off pretty much everything for WatchOS&lt;/a&gt; onstage — it looks like it’s not a big year for the wearable (but I’ll be very happy to get better always-on display support and multiple timers). There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?s=20"&gt;some new time complications, though&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uu3swa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just noticed there is a new set of Time complications in watchOS 8.  While a slight bit of ‘Sherlocking’ for Watchsmith, I’m honestly super glad it’s here.  A good number of my gray hairs came from supporting time based complications…glad I can focus elsewhere now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q44aVDMoZh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q44aVDMoZh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Smith (@_DavidSmith) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_DavidSmith/status/1402641598752735244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ypA0js"&gt;
&lt;p id="oQWKbQ"&gt;If you want to know if you’ll be getting these features, we’ve laid out which devices the new OSs will be coming to here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6n1jJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the devices that can run iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523116/apple-ios-ipados-15-watchos-8-macos-monterey-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/96fQEVd0sldTjJqJpzgnZoZrsug=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67005648/DSCF4082_Edited.7.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for an everyday pair or something for fitness, these are the best picks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="96Mp4M"&gt;The true wireless earbuds market has never been more crowded than it is in 2021. With so many to choose from, finding the best Bluetooth earbuds can seem daunting. But the vast selection is actually a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; thing: not only are there excellent picks for everyday buds to carry in your pocket, but you’ve also got a slew of options that prioritize things like noise cancellation, fitness, lengthy battery life, and comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ktn8kt"&gt;Even if you don’t consider yourself any kind of audiophile, it’s important to find a set of earbuds that sound good to you. This means different things depending on the person: do you want head-rattling bass or something more balanced with an immersive soundstage? You’ll want to find a pair with a good, reliable Bluetooth connection — all of the below picks check off that box — and enough battery life to last you through a normal day of intermittent listening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZpkO2"&gt;Remember that getting the most out of earbuds requires a good seal in your ear. Always try the various ear tip sizes that come with whichever buds you purchase — and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sizes in each ear. Ears are funny like that. Many of these earbuds have apps you can install on your phone to further personalize their sound and controls the way you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c35LSu"&gt;If you’re looking for the overall best noise-canceling earbuds, you’ll be thrilled with Sony’s WF-1000XM4. They have best-in-class noise cancellation, terrific sound quality, and set a new bar for battery life in the category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PcI69T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600158"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tVD5bj"&gt;But if you’ve got other priorities, there are a range of great options from Apple, Beats, Jabra, Sennheiser, and Ultimate Ears that won’t disappoint. This guide covers higher-end wireless earbuds.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4 are the best wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h2 id="HtRCZy"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f3y5ZM"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pflRtJ"&gt;Two years after releasing its first set of true wireless earbuds, Sony has returned with the redesigned WF-1000XM4. Now smaller and with an IPX4 water resistance rating, the new buds have the most impressive noise cancellation among all competitors — and they still sound phenomenal. Sony also includes memory foam ear tips that offer excellent noise isolation even before the noise cancellation kicks in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4WV6c"&gt;Battery life is another area where the 1000XM4s set a new bar: they can last for up to eight hours of continuous playback with noise canceling turned on, whereas most other NC earbuds top out at around five hours. The case supports wireless charging, and Sony has included its “speak to chat” feature that automatically turns down your audio and enables ambient sound mode when the earbuds detect that you’re talking out loud. Microphone performance remains the weakest aspect of the 1000XM4s, but it’s totally passable if you’re making calls at home. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds are another top pick for noise-canceling earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zOp8wQ"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507552/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-best-noise-cancellation"&gt;Bose QuietComfort Earbuds&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2AHitr"&gt;Runner-up noise-canceling earbuds&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPVlZ"&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds offer very powerful active noise cancellation, but what’s equally nice about them is how customizable the ANC is. You can choose between 11 different levels of noise cancellation (based on how much of the outside world you want mixed in) and set three favorites to cycle between when you double-tap the left earbud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UpL5pM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386455"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a6H0xo"&gt;Bose’s premium earbuds put out fantastic audio with punchy bass. Their transparency / ambient mode is second only to Apple in how natural it sounds. And even the voice mics work well, so you really get the whole package — as you should for this kind of money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mJvWk3"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Echo Buds 2 are the best noise-canceling earbuds for under $150.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gklh1x"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yWjaq5"&gt;Best noise-canceling earbuds under $150&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TUJLAg"&gt;Even if you never take advantage of their hands-free Alexa capabilities, the second-generation Amazon Echo Buds still offer a ton of other positives for an aggressively low price. The noise cancellation is better than on the original set — even if it can’t measure up to our top picks — and their revamped design makes for a more comfortable fit in your ears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SvgvJE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rilgjs"&gt;Sound quality is perfectly good for the price you’re paying, and these earbuds have a vented design like the AirPods Pro to prevent occlusion, which is that plugged-up feeling some people hate. Amazon’s ambient sound mode is also surprisingly natural and works very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0t6pa6"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro remain the best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners because some of their best features only work with other Apple products.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ht0eFb"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpmRPm"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for the iPhone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lNbhRr"&gt;There’s no beating the interplay between AirPods and Apple’s other devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The AirPods Pro don’t offer the best sound quality of our top picks, but it’s perfectly satisfactory to many people. And the active noise cancellation is right up there with Bose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMXRmM"&gt;But it really all comes together if you’re in Apple’s ecosystem and also own a Mac or iPad. The AirPods Pro can automatically hop between devices based on which one you’re using, and on iPhone or iPad, spatial audio delivers immersive surround sound when watching streaming video apps. They’re fantastic for making calls with, and Apple continues to pull ahead of competitors when it comes to ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Tv5p"&gt;Here’s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from &lt;a href="https://www.complyfoam.com/products/app-comply-foam-tips-compatible-with-airpods-pro/"&gt;Comply&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565954-REG%2Fdekoni_audio_etz_app_md3_airpods_pro_tips.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21309820%2Fbest-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dekoni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods 2 are the best wireless earbuds for making voice calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lWfBYu"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple AirPods&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kxX1hg"&gt;The best wireless earbuds for making voice calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="O08RZs"&gt;Thanks to their lengthy stems and reliable microphones, Apple’s open-style AirPods remain the best option if you’re someone who frequently makes calls while wearing your earbuds. They’re a dependable performer whether you’re talking to friends on the phone or co-workers on Zoom or Microsoft Teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t2zzJ"&gt;The AirPods provide a seamless, near-instant pairing process when used with Apple devices and also support features like audio sharing, spatial audio, and private listening if you’ve got an Apple TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LglHf0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600152"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="p9LG1M"&gt;By the nature of their design, the bass leaves a little to be desired and the AirPods do let in a lot out of outside noise — but some people prefer having that awareness, even if it means cranking the volume up at times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qmAqJ1"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W40xtb"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uDVgDy"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for multitasking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ukiqM"&gt;Jabra is pretty much the only company making true wireless earbuds that support “multipoint” for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. So you can pair them up with a phone and your laptop or tablet at the same time. Jabra’s mobile app offers a ton of customization over the controls, EQ, and even includes bonuses like white noise or nature sounds if you’ve got situations where they’d be handy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h8gk6p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWBz4q"&gt;The newer Elite 85t earbuds add more effective noise cancellation to the mix, but the 75ts are on sale so frequently that they’re still the go-to pick if multitasking is important to you. They pack a wallop when it comes to bass — but not to the point where it overwhelms the rest of the mix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B4Zz0"&gt;Jabra backs them with a two-year warranty in the event you experience any hardware issues. (I’ve had a 75t bud stop taking a charge out of nowhere, so it can happen.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="K2kK8C"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Powerbeats Pro earbuds pictured inside their case in someone’s hand." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/USk25QleHuTPa9jKtdful3kutKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16005385/cwelch_190402_3343_1627.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Powerbeats Pro have been around for some time now, but they still rank as the best earbuds for running.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MMAYVS"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8xKAQg"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for working out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="H4ocO9"&gt;Nothing has managed to unseat the Powerbeats Pro as the best fitness earbuds since their release in 2019. Their ear hook design keeps them planted on your ears during intense exercise, they can endure your sweatiest workouts, and the nine hours of continuous battery life should get you through just about any marathon. And the sound quality is killer, with plenty of bass to keep you motivated and moving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QnM1Ez"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386623"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QtSWeK"&gt;And since Beats is owned by Apple, the Powerbeats Pro can also take advantage of features like audio sharing, auto device switching (like the AirPods Pro), and a dead-simple pairing process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kRmMjq"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus can last for up to 11 hours on a single charge, which blows away many competitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mRgq3W"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KxKFD0"&gt;They can last 11 hours on a single charge. That’s what I consider marathon battery life for true wireless earbuds, and few other companies have managed to keep up with the longevity of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus. They lack active noise cancellation, so that helps them keep playing for longer, but even then, 11 hours is quite a feat. Like the Jabras, these are often on sale and easy to grab at a discount. They make for a good AirPods alternative if you’ve got an Android phone — particularly a Samsung one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N4SqQ0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386734"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 are the best wireless earbuds in terms of sound quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="17iIUo"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VBO6Vu"&gt;Sennheiser’s second swing at true wireless earbuds improve on the original Momentums with a more comfortable fit and the addition of active noise cancellation. But everything about these earbuds is second fiddle to their sound quality: the Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds put out dynamic, expressive, and wonderfully detailed audio. They’re the sort of buds that will bring out things in your favorite music you haven’t noticed before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdAurp"&gt;But that upgraded sound quality comes for a hefty $300 price. If you want arguably the best sound that true wireless earbuds can deliver, these are it. But all of these other picks sound plenty good in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Bd9TxW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386636"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’re not going to find any silicone ear tips that can match the UE Fits and their custom tips, which mold to match your ear shape in seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4qWQZj"&gt;Best wireless earbuds if comfort is everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq4SD9"&gt;If you often have difficulty finding ear tips that fit your ears comfortably, it doesn’t really get better than the UE Fits. These earbuds include special tips that mold to the shape of your ear during a 60-second fitting process that you activate with UE’s app. They get warm during molding (but not uncomfortably so) and you can feel them adapting to the contours of your ear canal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZxyrc"&gt;Once the process is done, you’re left with custom earbuds with a fit that’s as close to perfect as you’ll ever find — unless you visit your local audiologist for a professional mold, and that gets expensive fast. Ultimate Ears has a fit “guarantee” and will send you a second set of tips should your first molding attempt go awry. The UE Fits are quite good, last for up to eight hours of continuous playback, and they’re rated IPX4 for water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 review: Duet redux</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You can lean on its kickstand, but not its CPU&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="PPDKkv"&gt;All in all, Asus’s Chromebook Detachable CM3 is a nice package. It’s a 10.5-inch tablet with magnetically-attached fabric cover and kickstand. It’s &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM280000009"&gt;$389.99&lt;/a&gt; as tested, which means it’s priced far below all kinds of convertible Chromebooks. I’m not the first to make this comparison, but it’s a slightly more expensive, and slightly fancier version of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;$269 Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; (currently listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Fstudent-chromebooks%2FLenovo-CT-X636%2Fp%2FZZICZCTCT1X%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22526743%2Fasus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$269&lt;/a&gt;) that impressed me so much last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzJjZh"&gt;I think the CM3 is a slightly worse purchase than the Duet for most people who are looking for a secondary device, or a small Chromebook for a student. The CM3 does offer a few noticeable benefits over the Duet, but I’m not sure they’re worth $100. While features like a dual-folding kickstand, a garaged stylus, and a headphone jack are nice to have, none of them are as central to a device’s user experience as its processor. And while $269 is an acceptable price to pay for a tablet with a MediaTek chip, $389.99 is pushing it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKeGIq"&gt;With all that said, I don’t have many &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt; with this Chromebook. It’s just in a bit of an odd spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jfVlGB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10599304"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="VppNpw"&gt;My test unit includes 128GB of storage, 4GB of RAM, a 10.5-inch 1920 x 1200 display, and a MediaTek 8183 processor. There’s a 64GB version listed at &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202105AM280000008/laptopschromebook-ASUS-Chromebook-Detachable-CM3"&gt;$369.99&lt;/a&gt; as well. 64GB isn’t a lot of storage (and there’s no microSD card slot for expansion on the CM3), so my config is the one I’d recommend most people go for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1Iwbd"&gt;The most important thing to understand about the CM3 before you buy it is the size. It’s small, with just a 10.5-inch screen. This brings benefits and drawbacks. On the one hand, it’s quite slim and portable, at just 0.31 inches thick and 1.1 pounds (2.02 pounds with the keyboard and stand attached). It’s the kind of thing I could easily carry in my purse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 facing away from the camera angled slightly to the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AG0JGksONZGV3Wbz4y2M7uTX594=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646165/mchin_20190829_4618_0004.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 open from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K1zNh5YWec5wp4VCQnyX4ZX-DGM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646167/mchin_20190829_4618_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 seen from the right side, open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOMBdNB2tuY2CiRnTT2BbBHfudk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646166/mchin_20190829_4618_0005.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh look, a port!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mF8gOA"&gt;On the other hand, a 10.5-inch screen is cramped for a desktop OS like Chrome OS (though it is bright enough to use outdoors, and I appreciate that it has a 16:10 aspect ratio — 16:9 would be unbearable for me at this size). But it was too small for me to comfortably use as a work driver. I had to zoom out far to be able to see everything I needed to in my Chrome windows.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Csjw10"&gt;It also means there’s only so much space for the keyboard deck, which is also cramped. The touchpad, in particular, is small. The keyboard itself is roomier than the Duet’s, though — it has a surprising amount of travel and a satisfying click. While the small keys are a bit of an adjustment, none are small enough as to be unusable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWMkV4"&gt;Small doesn’t mean cheap, and the CM3’s build is fairly sturdy overall. The palm rests and detachable keyboard deck feel quite plasticky, but the tablet itself is aluminum (with “diamond-cut edges”, per Asus). The magnetic cover is made of a woven fabric, and looks quite similar to the cover of the Chromebook Duet. The cover is included with the price of the CM3, which isn’t the case with some detachables (such as Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21259805/microsoft-surface-go-2-review-windows-tablet-speed-intel-processor-price"&gt;Surface Go&lt;/a&gt; line). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpYkz7"&gt;A USI stylus lives in the top right corner of the chassis — it’s firmly in there, so you’ll need a nail to tug it out. It’s small, and not my favorite stylus I’ve ever used, but it is there and does work. The Duet supports USI styluses, but it doesn’t come with one, so that’s one advantage the CM3 brings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="R7Nq55"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8VeB5"&gt;The main way the CM3 is unique to other detachables is that its kickstand folds multiple ways. That is, you can fold it the long way when you’re using the tablet like a laptop, or you can flip the tablet vertically and fold the kickstand horizontally. This is a cool feature I haven’t seen before, and it does work — I was never worried about the CM3 falling over in either direction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YEo42"&gt;On the other hand, the only real use case I can think of for the horizontal position is video calls where you don’t need to have the keyboard attached and are okay with the camera being on the side of the screen. You can take your own view, but I’d rather use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; or dedicated tablet for these purposes and have the camera in the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Unut"&gt;My unit did have a bit of fraying on the edges of the keyboard deck, which was disappointing to see on a brand-new device, even at this price. The kickstand cover also slipped off the tablet a few times while I was adjusting the height, which isn’t something that ever happened with the Duet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K88PTf"&gt;Speaking of convertibility, the CM3 has a two-megapixel front-facing camera as well as an eight-megapixel rear-facing camera. Both cameras deliver a surprisingly reasonable picture. I wasn’t too washed out when I did a video call outside, nor was I too grainy in dim light. That said, the dual-camera setup is another cool-sounding feature that probably isn’t the most pragmatic: The rear camera isn’t good enough for actual photography of any kind, and the best use case is probably for snapping pictures of a whiteboard in class. It also takes a few seconds for the CM3 to swap between cameras (it’s not nearly as quick of a swap as it is on an iPhone, for example) so it wouldn’t have saved me a ton of time over just whipping out a phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 closed with the camera facing upwards, seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HIAwIHjLbXKeee6IXQD6DB99WDY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646170/mchin_20190829_4618_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look closely and you can see the crease running both ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yewsa_OubU2mNW8S6H3eQxQyImI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646169/mchin_20190829_4618_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A magnet at the top of the keyboard attaches to the bottom of the tablet, lifting the deck a bit off the ground.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FqMMNz"&gt;The CM3’s MediaTek MTK 8183 is a hybrid chip that’s mainly used in Android tablets. (It’s a different MediaTek chip from the one that was in the Duet last year, but very similar to the one in uh, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review"&gt;new Echo Show 8 smart display&lt;/a&gt;.) It’s far from the most powerful processor you can find in a Chromebook, but that’s by design — battery life is going to be a higher priority for many folks who are considering a device as portable as the CM3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PLVaw"&gt;The battery life is, in fact, excellent. I averaged 12 hours and 49 minutes of continuous use running the CM3 through my regular workload of Chrome tabs and Android apps including Slack, Messenger, Twitter, Gmail, Spotify, and an occasional Zoom call with the screen at medium brightness — over an hour longer than I saw from the Duet with the same workload. This is already a heavier load than many people may want to put the CM3 through, so you may get even more time between charges. The 45W USB-C adapter juiced the CM3 up to 40 percent in an hour, making it much faster than the Duet’s wimpy 10W charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDJ7Gw"&gt;That battery life doesn’t come free, though, and the CM3’s performance was a mixed bag. It works fine in Chrome, for example, albeit with a teensy bit of sluggishness when swapping tabs and resizing windows, as well as other Google services like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, and Meet (and it comes with a free 12-month 100GB membership to Google One for the rest of this year). Gaming is also fine — &lt;em&gt;Flipping Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Monsters &lt;/em&gt;were both smooth and stutter-free, regardless of whether the CM3 was plugged in or running on battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="oALc8k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599358"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KHD8PF"&gt;I also think Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which the CM3 supports, has gotten pretty good. It uses Android-esque gesture controls that can help flatten the learning curve for new Chromebook users. Swiping up brings you to the home screen, for example, and swiping right swaps between web pages. You can access a version of Chrome specifically for tablets, which allows you to easily open, close, and reorder tabs with drags, swipes, and large buttons. It’s not quite like using an iPad, but I do think it’s a smoother experience than Windows’s tablet mode (especially in Chrome). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOSsb6"&gt;All you have to do to switch in and out of tablet mode is snap the keyboard on and off — it takes a second, and my windows didn’t always quite go back to the way I’d arranged them when I put the keyboard back on, but it’s a reasonably smooth affair overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPZLTS"&gt;But the CM3 didn’t perform well on every task I needed. Sometimes when I was trying to use Slack or Messenger over a pile of Chrome tabs, something would freeze. Zoom calls were possible — which is more than can be said for some budget Chromebooks — but I did run into lag between audio and video inputs. Slack froze and crashed quite often, and Spotify crashed a few times as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 open, angled to the left. The screen displays a cartoon city scene on a pink background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tMlo3bBVQq_YRwFwa_-FMtTTXgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646164/mchin_20190829_4618_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Access all kinds of Android apps through the Google Play store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nkhPzK"&gt;Photo editing was where I really ran into trouble. Lightroom was basically unusable on the CM3 with just a few things running in the background — I tried to edit a batch of around 100 photos, and could consistently only get through a few before the program crashed. I tried to move over to Google Photos, which also eventually crashed, and ended up having to do everything in Gallery. Of course, not everyone will be editing photos on their Chromebook, or pushing it as hard as I was pushing this one, so it’s a matter of knowing your own needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ec4T45"&gt;Speaking of Zoom meetings, the dual speakers are okay for Zoom calls but not too much more. The songs I played had stronger percussion than I sometimes hear from laptop speakers, but it was thin and tinny overall. The microphone did seem to work well, and didn’t have trouble picking up my voice on calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SEBaIv"&gt;This was a difficult product to score. I do think the CM3 is a great device. And it does offer a few benefits over the Chromebook Duet that justify it costing a bit more. I’d probably purchase it over the Duet myself for the keyboard alone if I were looking for this type of device — the versatile kickstand, built-in stylus, and decent build quality are nice perks as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hpxXp7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CM3 is a great device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PzBoOy"&gt;But “if I were looking for this type of device” is doing some heavy lifting in that sentence. I’m not looking for a MediaTek device, and there’s a reason I’m not. The battery life is impressive, sure, but it’s just not enough horsepower for the workload I need. And if you are someone whose needs are suited to this low-powered processor (and there are plenty of these people in the world), I really think $389 is at the very high end of what you should be spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vJXA4p"&gt;Sure, the CM3 has a (just okay) stylus, a kickstand with a funky fold, slightly better battery life, and one extra port. But it’s also on par with or slower than the Duet in most tasks I tried, the audio is worse, and it’s thicker and heavier. Given all that, I’m not convinced the CM3’s advantages are worth $100 to most people who are shopping in this category.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces Xbox TV app and its own xCloud streaming stick</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rDtcdMTjb7kH2CSilQyxb7nRUpY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433070/Xbox_Devices_Halo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BSSbjq"&gt;Microsoft is working with TV manufacturers to make an Xbox app available on devices soon. The software giant is planning to bring its Xbox Game Pass service to TVs through its xCloud streaming technology, opening up more ways to get access to Xbox games. This will be available as both an app on TVs, and with Microsoft’s own dedicated streaming stick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjnYUa"&gt;“We’re working with global TV manufacturers to embed the Game Pass experience directly into internet-connected TVs so all you’ll need to play is a controller,” says Liz Hamren, head of gaming experiences and platforms at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JhCz1"&gt;Microsoft isn’t announcing exactly when this Xbox app will be available on TVs, nor which manufacturers will bundle it on their devices. Xbox chief Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612714/microsoft-xbox-app-tv-xcloud-streaming-app"&gt;previously hinted at an Xbox app for TVs&lt;/a&gt; late last year, noting he expects to “see that in the next 12 months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fng262"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft isn’t detailing pricing or release dates for its streaming stick&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ROVp4u"&gt;Spencer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21529925/xbox-tv-streaming-stick-xcloud-cloud-gaming-phil-spencer-interview"&gt;also hinted at&lt;/a&gt; Microsoft’s own Xbox streaming stick last year, something Microsoft now says will appear soon. “We’re also developing standalone streaming devices that you can plug into a TV or monitor, so if you have a strong internet connection, you can stream your Xbox experience,” reveals Hamren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayTP2H"&gt;Much like the TV app plans, Microsoft isn’t providing any details on release date or pricing for its own Xbox streaming devices. We don’t even know what they will look like. Microsoft revealed these details in a special press briefing ahead of its E3 event later this week. Microsoft will be focusing on games at its E3 showcase on Sunday June 13th, so it’s unlikely we’ll get any further details until the devices are ready to ship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2nVpJ"&gt;This Xbox Game Pass expansion to TVs is part of a broader effort by Microsoft to make its subscription service available beyond just phones and Xbox consoles. Microsoft is also announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291473"&gt;upgrades to its xCloud server blades&lt;/a&gt; today, and the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291502"&gt;access and use xCloud on Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waymo teams up with trucker JB Hunt on autonomous freight hauling in Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZ4KA8slElr0IPp3Yk5tnS3Arkw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433013/vpavic_191202_3827_0042.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="esi3H9"&gt;Waymo’s autonomous trucking unit got a boost with the announcement that it would be teaming up with JB Hunt Transport Services, a 56-year-old company based in Arkansas. The two companies will work collaboratively on a pilot project to evaluate the use of Waymo’s autonomous technology to move freight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WiXnEx"&gt;The test will take place in Texas, with Waymo’s Class 8 autonomous truck hauling goods along Interstate 45 between facilities in Houston and Fort Worth for one of JB Hunt’s customers. The trucks will operate autonomously but will be supervised by two Waymo employees, a commercially licensed driver and a software engineer, from the cab of the vehicle. If everything goes smoothly, Waymo and JB Hunt could decide to work together on more freight hauls in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY2wmi"&gt;While much of the public’s focus has been on Waymo’s autonomous minivans that operate in Arizona has part of a limited ride-hailing service, less attention has been paid to the company’s stated plans to eventually launch a commercial freight hauling business. Waymo has a small fleet of Peterbilt trucks that have been retrofitted with autonomous driving sensors and software, and it is currently is testing them in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21078438/waymo-self-driving-minivans-trucks-texas-new-mexico"&gt;Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gIdMwz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;less attention has been paid to Waymo’s plans to launch a commercial freight hauling business&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuiFLD"&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to deploy Level 4 trucks, a reference to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ (SAE) taxonomy for autonomous vehicles, commonly referred to as the SAE levels, which have become the global standard for defining self-driving. Level 4, or L4, vehicles can operate without a human driver behind the wheel but only within a specific geographic location, on a certain type of roadway, or under specific conditions, like good weather. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;Waymo has some Level 4 vehicles in operation outside of Phoenix, Arizona&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjk3NE"&gt;In addition to JB Hunt, Waymo is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536048/waymo-daimler-driverless-semi-trucks-cascadia-freightliner"&gt;working with Daimler&lt;/a&gt; on autonomous big rigs. The German automaker (and parent company of Mercedes-Benz) plans to integrate Waymo’s autonomous driving technology, widely considered to be among the best in the world, into its fleet of heavy-duty Freightliner Cascadia semi-trailer trucks. The Alphabet subsidiary also has preexisting agreements with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/20/18692764/waymo-nissan-renault-self-driving-car-japan-france"&gt;Renault-Nissan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16948356/waymo-google-fiat-chrysler-pacfica-minivan-self-driving"&gt;Fiat Chrysler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17165992/waymo-jaguar-i-pace-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2018"&gt;Jaguar Land Rover&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303324/volvo-waymo-l4-deal-electric-self-driving-robot-taxi"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7nFVO"&gt;Waymo is no stranger to Texas. The company’s groundbreaking demonstration of its prototype Firefly vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/blind-man-sets-out-alone-in-googles-driverless-car/2016/12/13/f523ef42-c13d-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story.html"&gt;took place in the city of Austin in October 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The company kept an office in the city until November 2019 when it abruptly shut it down, laying off 100 employees and contract workers in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1J9nc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="EQ16RO"&gt;Microsoft is making some significant upgrades to its Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service in the next few weeks. The Xbox cloud streaming service will be moving to Xbox Series X hardware on the server side, bringing dramatic improvements to load times and frame rates. Microsoft is also moving xCloud on the web out of beta, which is good news for owners of Apple devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O865B8"&gt;“We’re now in the final stages of internal testing, and we’ll be upgrading the experience for Ultimate members in the next few weeks,” says Kareem Choudhry, head of cloud gaming at Microsoft. “The world’s most powerful console is coming to Azure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWMqPR"&gt;The upgrade will include major improvements to xCloud, with players able to benefit from the same faster load times and improved frame rates that are available on Xbox Series X consoles. Microsoft’s xCloud service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377313/microsoft-xcloud-install-download-android-game-pass-ultimate-gamepad-xbox"&gt;launched in September&lt;/a&gt;, powered by Xbox One S server blades. The load times have been one of the troubling aspects of using Xbox game streaming, and this upgrade will dramatically reduce the wait time of launching games. Players will also be able to access Xbox Series X / S optimized games.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s xCloud service on an iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pVC0JH"&gt;Alongside the server upgrades, Microsoft is launching Xbox Cloud Gaming through the browser for all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members in the next few weeks. The service is currently in an invite-only beta mode, but the expansion will make it available for all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members to access xCloud streaming on iPhones, iPads, and on any device with a compatible browser (Chrome, Edge, and Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNVa8R"&gt;Microsoft is also expanding cloud gaming to Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan later this year, and hinting at plans for new Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. “We need to innovate to bring our games and services to more people around the world, and we’re investigating how to introduce new subscription offerings for Xbox Game Pass,” says Liz Hamren, head of gaming experiences and platforms at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMd5x2"&gt;These new Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will likely include some form of access to xCloud game streaming. Microsoft currently only offers Xbox game streaming to those who subscribe to the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate tier, which is priced at $14.99 per month. It’s easy to imagine a future where Microsoft offers a separate Game Pass tier that only provides access to Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRnGgg"&gt;Microsoft is also announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291461"&gt;plans for an Xbox TV app and its own streaming stick&lt;/a&gt; today, alongside the ability to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291502"&gt;access and use xCloud on Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt; later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You’ll soon be able to try Xbox games before downloading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yf-jaF437p_KzrCGorm93BClq0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69433012/acastro_210429_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lmdwqc"&gt;Microsoft is planning to let Xbox console owners try games before they download them later this year. The new Xbox dashboard feature will allow console players to stream games through Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service instantly. It’s part of a push to integrate xCloud more into Xbox consoles and into the Xbox app on Windows PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMDe9o"&gt;“Later this year, we’ll add cloud gaming directly to the Xbox app on PCs, and integrated into our console experience, to light up all kinds of scenarios, like ‘try before you download,’” says Kareem Choudhry, head of cloud gaming at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjlR2x"&gt;Microsoft isn’t detailing all of the ways that xCloud will appear on Xbox consoles, but trying games before you download them certainly opens up possibilities for Xbox owners who want to know what a game is like before buying it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dr_zOQ0vi7dEm4wEMyjJ29_NxdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649774/xboxdashboard.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox Series X dashboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IGaMry"&gt;Either way, utilizing xCloud to let Xbox players quickly jump into games before they’re downloaded will be particularly useful on day one game launches. With games regularly exceeding 100GB, it often takes hours to download titles if you didn’t plan ahead and preload a game before its launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnLe9x"&gt;In a briefing with members of the press ahead of Microsoft’s Xbox E3 event on Sunday, the company’s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, was keen to stress Microsoft’s commitment to Xbox Game Pass and cloud gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfNtJj"&gt;“So right now we’re the only platform shipping games on console, PC, and cloud simultaneously,” says Spencer. “Others bring console games to PC years later, not only making people buy their hardware up front, but then charging them a second time to play on PC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQUrQt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox chief calls out Sony’s approach&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGyTwq"&gt;Spencer is of course referring to Sony and its ongoing efforts to bring more PlayStation games to PC years after their launch. Microsoft obviously prefers its own approach to launching simultaneously across multiple platforms and being available on Xbox Game Pass on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VOD0mW"&gt;Speaking of Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft is also committing to some form of a timeline for exclusive first-party content for the service. “In terms of the overall lineup, we want to get to a point of releasing a new game every quarter ... we know that a thriving entertainment service needs a consistent and exciting flow of new content,” explains Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios. “So our portfolio will continue to grow as our service grows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWW25X"&gt;Microsoft isn’t providing an update on its Xbox Game Pass subscription growth yet. The service jumped to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21449219/xbox-game-pass-15-million-subscribers-microsoft-growth"&gt;18 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, after growing steadily throughout 2020. Today’s announcements are part of some broader Xbox and xCloud news, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291473"&gt;server upgrades to xCloud&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft’s plans for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22291461"&gt;Xbox TV app and streaming sticks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loki director Kate Herron says the show is a ‘big love letter to sci-fi’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iA85JYM9P2ZmzrmoU7303sXJf1A=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432900/ARC_101_03124_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MrYsqT"&gt;Before she got her start working on TV shows like &lt;em&gt;Sex Education&lt;/em&gt;, Kate Herron’s career involved temping at a lot of offices. So when she was given the chance to direct &lt;em&gt;Loki,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523186/loki-review-episode-1-2-disney-plus"&gt;a new Disney Plus series that follows a bureaucratic organization called the TVA that controls time&lt;/a&gt;, she knew exactly the vibe she was going for. She describes the style as &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt; meets brutalist architecture — with plenty of sci-fi influences. And it was her previous career that helped inspire some of those aesthetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="HDEkw2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10599029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJ4vS2"&gt;“I took a lot of experience as well from my own life as an office temp, I worked in a lot of offices before I got my first film job,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It actually inspired the style of tech. I remember the computers I used to work on were really archaic and really old. But I was working for these big institutions, and they were like, ‘Well, we’re not going to update them because they’re not broken.’ I like the idea that this organization that’s controlling time, they maybe wouldn’t have the most futuristic technology. But it works, so why are they going to change it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kZYdv"&gt;Herron describes working on&lt;em&gt; Loki&lt;/em&gt; as “a dream,” the kind of project she’s long aspired to take on. “I always wanted to direct stories that are big scale and fantastical worlds,” she explains. She also happens to be a big Loki fan. “I just wanted to be part of whatever this character’s next chapter was going to be and see what they were going to do with him. So I pursued Marvel very heavily, I would say, for this job. I was very keen,” Herron says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PjU2-VF_jRF6hdAj5tOXDQgrJRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22647475/ARC_102_03798_R.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate Herron on set with Tom Hiddleston and Owen Wilson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="36ZKRw"&gt;Part of that involved creating a giant pitch document, which featured all kinds of details: playlists, character ideas, and lots of visual references, like pictures of stark, brutalist buildings. There was &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of reference material. “It’s this big love letter to sci-fi,” she says of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. “But with the TVA specifically, you can see &lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metropolis&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Brazil,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt;. We pulled from a lot of different places.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0elBFx"&gt;One of the main goals, she says, was to make the TVA feel like a real organization. This despite the fact that it’s a group that exists outside of time and space and works for a trio of god-like creatures called the Time Keepers who control the flow of time. “We wanted to make the TVA feel as grounded and real as possible, even though it’s obviously operating in a very fantastical space,” she says. The office features simple desks and a soulless cafeteria, and TVA agents use retrofuturistic computers that look like the iMac’s long-lost ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLU0W7NaOEpKQw43NwCrQ2KAt-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22647572/Screen_Shot_2021_06_09_at_10.45.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="or0Kx2"&gt;One of the more memorable gadgets is called a tempad. Seemingly everyone at the TVA carries around the smartphone-like device, which looks a bit like a cross between a Famicom and an iPhone, with an interface reminiscent of classic &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear&lt;/em&gt; games. “I suppose it’s probably the closest thing to our phones that they have,” Herron says. “It does everything for them. I’m a gamer, and the interface was definitely inspired by SNES games and also the old Game Boy Camera. I think it was fun taking these different ideas and putting them into this one bit of technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ia7Skg"&gt;All of this production design gives &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; a unique aesthetic, particularly compared to other stories in the MCU. But it was also important for giving the show its sense of humor. Just like in movies like &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt; or shows like &lt;em&gt;The Good Place&lt;/em&gt;, there’s something inherently funny in the contrast of a strict, bureaucratic organization dedicated to something outlandish like aliens or the afterlife. The same goes for &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and the TVA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1t6CE"&gt;“Good comedy writing is always coming from truth,” Herron explains. “&lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide&lt;/em&gt; did that so well. We’re like a fish out of water with Arthur, but the behavior in the people — well, not people, the aliens — he meets could feel like someone on earth. I remember in &lt;em&gt;Men in Black&lt;/em&gt;, there’s a coffee room, a tiny little room where they have their coffee break. In the offices I worked in, yeah, there were rooms like that. I think that was really key for me with the TVA, giving its own sense of style, but also at the same time for someone who has been in that office culture, they’ll see things in the show, and it’ll be familiar to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3ZVsx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; debuts on Disney Plus this week, and it marks the third Marvel show on the streaming service. So far, each has had a very distinct vibe, from &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s sitcom pastiche to the grittier &lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;. For Herron, seeing viewers engage with these kinds of shows, particularly the stranger aspects of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, has been encouraging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTLMZy"&gt;“I was happy that the weird was being embraced,” she says. “Because our show is pretty weird.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to set up two-factor authentication on your online accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vLYLBlBpiHxeKVyBro78kS2OuZY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68635030/akrales_170614_1776_0058.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="96nXbn"&gt;Just about any account you own on the internet is prone to being hacked. After numerous widespread breaches through the past few years, tech companies have been working together to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249895/web-authentication-webauthn-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-standard-browsers"&gt;develop a standard&lt;/a&gt; that would make passwords a thing of the past, replacing them with more secure methods like biometric or PIN-based logins that do not require transferring data over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzdYrE"&gt;But while those standards are still being adopted, the next best way to secure your accounts is two-factor authentication, or 2FA. This a process that gives web services secondary access to the account owner (you) in order to verify a login attempt. Typically, this involves a phone number and / or email address. This is how it works: when you log in to a service, you use your mobile phone to verify your identity by either clicking on a texted / emailed link or typing in a number sent by an authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Go1Z1k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:6019722"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LzRe1A"&gt;What are authenticator apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MtJf72"&gt;Authenticator apps are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18098286/vovox-security-breach-two-factor-authentication-2fa-codes-exposed"&gt;considered more secure than texting&lt;/a&gt;. They also offer flexibility when you’re traveling to a place without cellular service. Popular options include &lt;a href="https://authy.com/"&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en"&gt;Google Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Faccount%2Fauthenticator" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fhde-otp-generator%2Fid571240327%3Fmt%3D8%26ign-mpt%3Duo%253D8%26at%3D10l7an&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22215571%2Ffactor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hennge OTP&lt;/a&gt; (iOS only). These apps mostly follow the same procedure when you’re adding a new account: you scan a QR code associated with your account, and it is saved in the app. The next time you log in to your service or app, it will ask for a numerical code; just open up the authenticator app to find the randomly generated code required to get past security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarOxI"&gt;While 2FA — via text, email, or an authenticator app — does not completely cloak you from potential hackers, it is an important step in preventing your account from being accessed by unauthorized users. Here’s how to enable 2FA on your accounts across the web. (We’ve listed the services in alphabetical order.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4WMChB"&gt;Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3S9Sst"&gt;Go to the Amazon homepage and log in. Hover over “Accounts &amp;amp; Lists” and click on “Account.” A box labeled “Login &amp;amp; security” will be at the top of the page, so click on that and then click the “Edit” button on “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings.” (You may be asked to reenter your password first.) You can also navigate directly to that page by &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/a/settings/approval"&gt;following this link&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQNtT3"&gt;Click “Get Started” and Amazon will walk you through the process of registering your phone number, or you can opt to use your preferred authenticator app by syncing it through a QR code. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Start with Amazon’s “Login &amp;amp;amp; security” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yvWGuauq7CG1F_uL2kEbcCNxcZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8673411/amazon_2fa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Start with Amazon’s “Login &amp;amp; security” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1tGC9L"&gt;You can activate 2FA on both the Android and iOS Amazon app by tapping the three-line “hamburger” menu on the left side and finding “Your Account” &amp;gt; “Login &amp;amp; security.” The same “Two-Step Verification (2SV) Settings” selection should be available for you to edit and toggle on 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Amazon app also lets you set up two-step verification." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BTE03PyTqVvvIvwx7jinYhHNNcY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931158/Screenshot_20200428_152732__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon app also lets you set up two-step verification.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use a third-party authenticator app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcGvg7BZRru-imNviPqD8VxOJWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931160/Screenshot_20200428_152813.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use a third-party authenticator app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fi3Cs"&gt;Once your phone number or authenticator app has been verified, you can select trusted devices to bypass 2FA or generate a code to log in via a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rzz8Rl"&gt;Apple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="11gB7w"&gt;Two-factor authentication is currently offered to Apple users on iOS 9 and later, and on macOS X El Capitan and later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iyVQno"&gt;iOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sKeB69"&gt;The steps are slightly different depending on how updated your iOS software is. For those using iOS 10.3 or later, you can enable 2FA on your Apple ID by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; [Your Name] &amp;gt; “Password &amp;amp; Security” &amp;gt; “Two-Factor Authentication.” Turn on 2FA to receive a text message with a code each time you log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYrr8t"&gt;For those using iOS 10.2 or earlier, the settings are under “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Apple ID” &amp;gt; “Password &amp;amp; Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pKUQDC"&gt;macOS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="td54Cr"&gt;Again, steps are slightly different depending on your version of macOS. If you’re using Catalina or later, click the Apple icon on the upper-left corner of your screen, then click “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “Apple ID.” Click on “Password &amp;amp; Security” under your name, and then select “Turn On Two-Factor Authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtKOiS"&gt;For Mojave and earlier, after you click the Apple icon, click “System Preferences” &amp;gt; “iCloud” &amp;gt; “Account Details.” (You can shorten this step a bit by typing in “iCloud” using Spotlight.) Click on “Security” and you’ll see the option to turn on 2FA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5jvEv"&gt;The remainder of the steps, for iOS or Mac, are the same. You can opt for Apple to send you a six-digit verification code by text message or phone call. You can also set up a physical security key here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjkK5G"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SUjv2h"&gt;From your Dropbox homepage on the web, click your profile avatar and select “Settings,” then go to the “Security” tab. Find “Two-Step Verification,” which will tell you the status of your 2FA. Toggle to turn the feature on and choose to receive 2FA through a text or your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dropbox also lets you use a text or authenticator app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BnMf_xf_gWHbAYow1HIjw-lI8jg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/15980136/Screen_Shot_2019_03_22_at_1.37.09_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dropbox also lets you use a text or authenticator app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DalDSJ"&gt;Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aOzHeQ"&gt;The way to access Facebook’s 2FA settings is a bit different between the app and the web (and Facebook tends to update both layouts often). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWtSB4"&gt;On the mobile app, you can access your privacy settings by tapping the hamburger icon on the upper-right corner (Android) or the lower-right corner (iOS) and scrolling down to the bottom to find the “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” menu. Tap “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security and Login” and select “Use two-factor authentication.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqC8Js"&gt;You can opt for a text message, an authenticator app, or a security key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G48ylI"&gt;On the web, click the down arrow in the upper-right corner, and select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy Shortcuts.” Look for the “Account Security” heading and click on “Use two-factor authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Facebook lets you authenticate via text message, an authenticator app, or a security key." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/40skyR6ZXwIVmSscfb10DG0q-pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536757/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.51.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook lets you authenticate via text message, an authenticator app, or a security key.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h7lEUo"&gt;Additionally, for apps that don’t support 2FA when logging in with a Facebook account (such as Xbox and Spotify), you can generate a unique password specifically associated with that account. From the original down arrow, select “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Settings,” and then, from the menu on the left, “Security and Login” &amp;gt; “App passwords” (under the “Two-Factor Authentication” subhead). After resubmitting your Facebook password, you’ll be able to name the app, click generate, and save that password for the next time you have to log in. Under the same “Two-Factor Authorization” subhead, you can choose specific iterations of the app (say, on your laptop) where you can forgo the login code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mj6fL8"&gt;Fitbit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USZfJy"&gt;Fitbit has only recently added 2FA — in fact, as this was written, the feature was rolling out, but we haven’t seen it yet, so we haven’t been able to verify these steps. But assuming you’ve got access to the new feature, here’s what you do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVnUYr"&gt;To turn 2FA for your Fitbit, tap on the “Today” tab in your app and then on your profile image. Select “Account Settings” &amp;gt; “Two Factor Authorization” and turn 2FA on. Fitbit will send you a text message with a verification code; once you enter that, along with your password, you’re in. (Unfortunately, Fitbit only uses text messages for verification, rather than giving you an option for an authenticator app.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvaAFB"&gt;Fitbit gives you a recovery code to use in case you lose or change your phone. The company recommends that you put that code somewhere safe; if you lose the code, you can get another one by using the app to turn off 2FA and then turn it on again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Y1iloH"&gt;Google&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sgClWT"&gt;The easiest way to turn on 2FA across your Google accounts (e.g., Gmail, YouTube, or Google Maps) is by heading over to the main &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/landing/2step/"&gt;2FA landing page&lt;/a&gt; and clicking “Get Started.” You’ll be asked to log in and then select your mobile device from a list. (If you have an iPhone, you may have to download a separate app.) If Google succeeds in sending a message to that phone, you will be asked to enter a phone number, and then you can choose whether you want to receive verification codes by text message or phone call. Again, Google will try out your chosen method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmqXTo"&gt;After that, Google will first send prompts to your phone that allow you to simply select “Yes” or “No” when a login attempt occurs. If that doesn’t work, it will send the text message or phone call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once two-factor is enabled, Google will send a notification asking you to authenticate." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meCsWyG9ni-b3aVP0_CwixSZ6tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931218/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.48.11_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once 2FA is enabled, Google will send a notification asking you to authenticate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0G4wh5"&gt;You can also generate backup codes for offline access. Google generates 10 codes at a time and they’re designed to be single-use, so once you’ve successfully used one, cross it out (assuming you’ve printed them), as it will no longer work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="r40w1c"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7W3jFx"&gt;Instagram added 2FA to its mobile app in 2017, but now you can also activate it through the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMJiDL"&gt;To activate 2FA on your mobile app, tap on your profile and select the hamburger menu on the upper-right corner. Look for “Settings” &amp;gt; “Security,” where you’ll find a menu item for “Two-Factor Authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVIq21"&gt;Here, you can choose between text message-based verification or a code sent to your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="GIF by Amelia Krales / The Verge" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qKSxexIkcqXfqkNlQViNqjyTZO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8700877/VRG02AK_1776_HOW_TO_2FA_02.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF by Amelia Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hJYwoA"&gt;To turn on 2FA using the web, log in to Instagram, click on your profile icon in the upper-right corner, and select “Settings” from the drop-down menu. Clicking this will pop open a settings menu, where you can find the same “Privacy and Security” section as on the app. From here, you can turn on 2FA and, just as in the app, choose your method for verification.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the Instagram settings page, then “Privacy and Security.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lAQmgXpxoalWbn0kuTvpj57JUB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536701/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_3.33.31_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the Instagram settings page, then “Privacy and Security.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1yd7WX"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="y7VGEa"&gt;Log in to your Microsoft account and find the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3FLinkId%3D529561&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22215571%2Ffactor-authentication-2fa-apple-microsoft-google-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Security settings&lt;/a&gt;” menu (there are several ways to get there; click on the link for the easiest). Look for the “Two-step verification” section and click on the setup link. You’ll be walked through the steps needed to use either the Microsoft Authenticator app or a different authentication app. You’ll also be able to create passwords for apps that don’t accept 2FA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="izBJXc"&gt;Nest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9DSl8"&gt;Smart home products like Nest are not exempt from getting hacked. Current Nest users will have signed in to the app via their Google accounts, and so will be using Google’s 2FA feature (see above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jirQ16"&gt;If you’ve resisted migrating your existing Nest account to your Google account, you may still be able to use 2FA. On the home screen, go to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Account” &amp;gt; “Manage account” &amp;gt; “Account security,” and select two-step verification. Toggle the switch to on. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0dVQRg"&gt;Keep in mind that all of your devices will be automatically signed out, so you’ll have to sign in again using two-step verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVOKMf"&gt;If all your family members don’t have their own logins and have been using yours, it’s a good idea to set them up with separate logins using Family Accounts. Otherwise, when they try to log on using two-step verification, the necessary code will be sent to your phone, not theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fJBuLy"&gt;PayPal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swH76g"&gt;On the main Summary page, click the gear icon and select the “Security” tab. Look for the section called “2-step verification” and click on the “Set Up” link. You’ll be able to choose whether to have a code texted to you or to use an authenticator app. (PayPal also offers to find an authenticator app if you want one.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PayPal will offer to find an authenticator app if you don’t have one." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHK7Ab5cjB07etE3MHnOaZr08R4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538569/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.41.09_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal will offer to find an authenticator app if you don’t have one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VvQbdI"&gt;If you lose your phone, change numbers, or decide to revoke authorization rights, come back to this menu to make adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7Ywec"&gt;Note that the interface is different if you use PayPal as a business account. From the main “Summary” page, click the gear icon to be taken to the “Settings” page. Under “Login and Security,” look for the “Security Key” option to add your phone number or a security key as your 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eb6xru"&gt;Ring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RwA4Jd"&gt;Like with Nest, make sure your Ring app is up to date. Swipe over from the left, then go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-Step Verification” (you’ll find it under “Account Security”). Tap the big “Turn on two-factor” button. A series of prompts will ask for your password, phone number, and the verification code that will be sent to your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jxBIA"&gt;From then on, you’ll need both your password and an SMS verification code whenever you want to log in to Ring from a new device. You can also opt to have the codes sent to an email address instead of over SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3wZlHD"&gt;Signal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gifHsA"&gt;Rather than traditional 2FA, Signal uses a PIN. Select your profile icon on the upper-left side to reach the “Settings” menu, and then select “Account.” If you toggle on “Registration Lock,” each time you re-register your phone number, you’ll need to enter your PIN (which you were asked for when you originally registered). Signal requires your PIN to be at least four digits long, up to a maximum of 20 digits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qH37IU"&gt;When you first enable Registration Lock, Signal will ask you to type in your PIN for the first six and 12 hours after being enabled. The company says this is designed to help you to remember it through random repetition. So after the first day, it will ask you to enter it in the next day, then in three days, after a full week, and finally one last time after 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUwwu"&gt;If you happen to forget your PIN and can’t log in to Signal, you will have to wait for seven days of inactivity for your registration lock to expire, after which you can log in to your app again to set up a new PIN. Those already actively using Signal won’t have to worry about the Registration Lock resetting, as that clock starts only when the app isn’t open. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OslvMC"&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wqXOXa"&gt;To enable 2FA, you’ll first need to find the “Account Settings” page. There are two ways to access this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="OMqM43"&gt;Click on your username or profile picture in the Slack app to open a drop-down menu, and then select “View profile.” Your account information will now display on the right side of the chat window. Under your avatar, next to the “Edit Profile” button, click the three-dot icon for additional actions, and select “Account settings.” You can also head straight to &lt;a href="http://my.slack.com/account/settings"&gt;my.slack.com/account/settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SuDMWN"&gt;You should immediately see the selection for “Two-Factor Authentication.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lvEr4D"&gt;If you do not see the option for 2FA, check whether your Slack account is for work. Some employers may use single sign-on services that bypass the need for 2FA, which would remove this option from Slack’s Account Settings page.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dkPknlWqR0oYvH3aW9DkZZClRSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8674071/slack_2fa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like most other apps, Slack lets you use either SMS or an authentication app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="95lwat"&gt;If this is a personal Slack, however, then select “Expand” on “Two-Factor Authentication” and hit the “Set Up Two-Factor Authentication” button to verify your information via an SMS or authenticator app. If you have multiple email addresses, you may need to select a default one before you can decide on your preferred 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JyIyx7"&gt;Snapchat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls9eeF"&gt;From the app’s main camera screen, tap your profile icon and find the gear icon to access your settings. Select “Two-Factor Authentication” and choose whether to receive a text message verification or hook it up to your authenticator app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U18RpL"&gt;Once 2FA has been enabled on your Snapchat account, you can add trusted devices, plus request a recovery code for when you’re planning to be somewhere without cellular service. Snapchat does not seem to currently support security-key logins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VixNS6"&gt;TikTok&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lQIy8o"&gt;To set up 2FA on TikTok (in this case, we’re assuming a mobile device), tap your profile icon on the lower right, then the three dots in the upper right of the screen. Go to “Security and login” and you’ll see “2-step verification.” TikTok offers to send a verification code via a text message or email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="riVNpw"&gt;Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFo0DY"&gt;On the Twitter mobile app, tap the three-line “hamburger” icon at the top left of the screen and select “Settings and privacy.” Go to “Account” &amp;gt; “Security.” Tap “Two-factor authentication” and follow the directions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaAdva"&gt;On the web, click on “More” in the left-hand menu and find “Settings and privacy.” Click on “Security and account access” (or you can just follow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/settings/security_and_account_access"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;). Select “Security” &amp;gt; “Two-factor authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LjA6YE"&gt;Once you’re all set up, Twitter will give you the option to verify through an authenticator app or via a text message with a code sent to your phone. Twitter has also added security-key support. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter lets you use a text message, an app, or a security key for authentication." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xO3a1YjV128HBni2tNODpVkCoE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19931118/Screen_Shot_2020_04_28_at_3.18.14_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter lets you use a text message, an app, or a security key for authentication.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bvcRkp"&gt;As with other services mentioned above, you can generate a backup code to use when you’re traveling and will be without internet or cell service. You may also see an option to create a temporary app password that you can use to log in from other devices. This can be used to log in to third-party apps if you have them linked to your Twitter account. Note that the temporary password expires one hour after being generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pGQRc0"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGdipv"&gt;Open WhatsApp and find the “Settings” menu under the upper-right dots icon. Look under “Account” &amp;gt; “Two-step verification” &amp;gt; “Enable.” The app will ask you to enter a six-digit PIN to use as verification. You can optionally add an email address in case you forget your PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHDrKE"&gt;Having an email associated with your WhatsApp account is important since the service won’t let you reverify yourself if you’ve used WhatsApp within the last seven days and have forgotten your PIN. So if you can’t wait a week to reverify, it’s helpful to have entered an email address so you can log yourself in or disable 2FA. In the same vein: be cautious of emails encouraging you to turn off 2FA if you didn’t request it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u4ZojK"&gt;Did we miss your favorite apps?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wxgHe3"&gt;For more information, check out the &lt;a href="https://2fa.directory/"&gt;2FA Directory&lt;/a&gt;, which categorizes and lists companies that support 2FA, and gives you the option to message a company on Twitter, Facebook, or email to request that 2FA be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4X9gF"&gt;A final note: while adding 2FA is great for an extra layer of security on all your accounts, remember that you should be changing and updating your passwords regularly even with 2FA enabled, just to stay in tip-top shape. If that’s not your style, you can also use a password manager to automatically take care of it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y34DWy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 10th, 2021, 8:00AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 19th, 2017, and has been checked and updated several times so that the instructions for adding 2FA to these apps remain current. This is the latest update. Instructions for Fitbit and TikTok have also been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQJHSJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With iCloud Plus, Apple’s privacy promise is paired with an upsell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jNNneQHsZgLw96texISzkDykoEs=/321x158:2040x1304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69432729/appleprivacy_vsavov2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some privacy may be paywalled&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="DAnKrI"&gt;Apple has spent considerable time championing itself as a protector of user privacy. Its CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that privacy is “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/1/9437717/apple-ceo-tim-cook-privacy-car-npr-interview"&gt;a fundamental human right&lt;/a&gt;,” the company has based &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446220/apple-privacy-ad-video-ad-tracking-transparency"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18266276/apple-iphone-ad-privacy-facetime-bug"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420108/apple-new-over-sharing-ad-privacy-security-iphone"&gt;campaigns&lt;/a&gt; around its privacy promises, and it’s had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook"&gt;high profile battles&lt;/a&gt; with authorities to keep its users’ devices private and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub0zXv"&gt;The pitch is simple: our products protect your privacy. But this promise has shifted very subtly in the wake of this week’s iCloud Plus announcement, which for the first time bundled new security protections into a paid subscription service. The pitch is still “our products keep you safe,” but now one of those “products” is a monthly subscription that doesn’t come with the device in your box — even if those devices are getting more built-in protections as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48bdJE"&gt;iCloud has always been one of Apple’s simplest services. You get 5GB of free storage to backup &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT207428"&gt;everything from images, to messages and app data&lt;/a&gt;, and you pay a monthly subscription if you want more (or just want to silence &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/icloud-storage-your-guide-to-the-other-apple-tax-1516820540"&gt;Apple’s ransom note&lt;/a&gt; when you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17168618/apple-more-free-icloud-space-200gb"&gt;inevitably run out of storage&lt;/a&gt;). Apple isn’t changing anything about the pricing or storage options as part of the shift to iCloud Plus. Prices will still range from $0.99 a month for 50GB of storage up to $9.99 for 2TB. But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; changing is the list of features you’re getting, which is expanding by three. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5aUsX2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Private Relay and Hide my Email are privacy features included with iCloud Plus&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mEZYZl"&gt;The first change sits more within iCloud’s traditional cloud storage remit, and is an expansion of Apple’s existing HomeKit Secure Video offering. iCloud Plus now lets you securely stream and record from an &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/06/apple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8/#:~:text=%20and%202tb%20with%20an%20unlimited%20number%20of%20homekit%20secure%20video%20cameras%20(%249.99%20per%20month)"&gt;unlimited number of cameras&lt;/a&gt;, up from a previous &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/iphone/iph7bc5df9d9/ios#:~:text=up%20to%20five%20cameras"&gt;maximum of five&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGfrOg"&gt;With the new Private Relay and Hide My Mail features, however, iCloud Plus is expanding its remit from a storage-based service into a storage and privacy service. The privacy-focused additions are minor in the grand scheme of the protections Apple offers across its ecosystem, and Apple isn’t using them as justification for increasing the cost of iCloud. But they nevertheless open the door to so-called “premium” privacy features becoming a part of Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;large and growing services empire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwdyUq"&gt;The features appear as an admission from Apple about the limits of what privacy protections can do on-device. “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/5/18169781/apple-google-privacy-troll-billboard"&gt;What happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone&lt;/a&gt;” was how the company put its promise in a 2019 ad, but when your iPhone needs to connect to the internet to browse the web, receive email, and generally earn the “i” in “iPhone,” inevitably some of its privacy rests on the infrastructure serving it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPFpAY"&gt;The most interesting of these new features is Apple’s Private Relay, which aims to shield your web traffic from prying eyes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;. It hides your data from both internet service providers as well as advertisers that might build a detailed profile on you based on your browsing history. While it sounds a bit like a VPN, Apple claims the Private Relay’s dual-hop design means even Apple itself doesn’t have a complete picture of your browsing data. Regular VPNs, meanwhile, require a level of trust that means you &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/24/free-vpn-bad-for-privacy/"&gt;need to be careful&lt;/a&gt; about which VPN you use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DeG-p67DnKMzS4Km-DT-vaYOwNU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649047/icloud_private_relay_diagram.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CJD1oh"&gt;As Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering explains, VPNs can protect your data from outsiders, but they “involve putting a lot of trust in a single centralized entity: the VPN provider. And that’s a lot of responsibility for that intermediary, and involves the user making a really difficult trust decision about exposing all of that information to a single entity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98pAcd"&gt;“We wanted to take that completely out of the equation by having a dual-hop architecture,” Federighi &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90643627/apple-privacy-wwdc-private-relay-vpn-icloud-plus-macos-monterey"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPQkKW"&gt;Here’s how it works. When using Private Relay your internet traffic is being sent via two proxy servers on its way to its destination. First, your traffic gets encrypted before it leaves your device. Then, once it hits the initial, Apple-operated server, it gets assigned an anonymous IP that hides your specific location. Next up, the second server, which is controlled by a third-party, decrypts the web address and forwards the traffic to its destination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="gDWvR6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple thinks today’s VPNs pose “a really difficult trust decision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFmCY"&gt;Apple can’t see which website you’re requesting, only the IP address you’re requesting it from, and third-parties can’t see that IP address, only the website you’re requesting. (Apple says it also uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163871/cloudflare-apple-dns-protocol-online-privacy"&gt;Oblivious DNS over HTTPS.&lt;/a&gt;) That’s different from most “double VPN” and “multi-hop” VPN services you can subscribe to today, where a provider may control both servers. You could perhaps combine a VPN and a proxy server to do something similar, though. Apple says Private Relay won’t impact performance, which can be a concern with these other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzT2am"&gt;While Private Relay is theoretically more private than a regular VPN, Apple’s offering is also more limited. You can’t use it to trick websites into thinking you’re accessing them from a different location, so you’re not going to be able to use Private Relay to get around geographical limitations on content blocked by a government or a service like Netflix. And it only seems to cover web browsing data through Safari, not third-party browsers or native apps. In a &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10096/"&gt;WWDC developer session&lt;/a&gt; about the feature, Apple says that Private Relay will also include DNS queries and a “small subset of traffic from apps,” specifically insecure HTTP traffic. But there was no mention of other browsers, and Apple clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’s only handling app traffic when your app technically happens to be loading the web inside a browser window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Dtq6yXo9hGGm4aRcOWg0hXgVLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649697/Apple_iPhone12Pro_mail_new_message_hide_my_email_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hide my Email provides a slick interface for making burner email addresses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68gn2K"&gt;In addition to Private Relay, iCloud Plus also includes Hide my Email, a feature designed to protect the privacy of your email address. Instead of needing to use your real email address for every site that requests it (increasing the risk of an important part of your login credentials becoming public, not to mention getting inundated with spam), Hide My Email lets you generate and share unique random addresses which will then forward any messages they receive back to your true email address. It’s another privacy-focused feature that sits outside of iCloud’s traditional area of focus, and could be useful even if similar options have been available for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umJUM7"&gt;Gmail, for example, lets you use a simple “+” symbol to&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/3/6100893/how-to-make-your-email-address-as-hard-to-guess-as-your-password"&gt; add random extra characters to your email address&lt;/a&gt;. Even Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650885/apple-sign-in-sso-tool-data-collection-privacy-ios-13-wwdc-2019"&gt;“Sign In with Apple” service&lt;/a&gt; pulls a similar trick, handing out random email addresses to each service you use it with. But the advantage of Apple’s new service is that it gives you an easily-accessible shortcut to generate them right in its Mail app and Safari, putting the feature front and center in a way that seems likely to boost its mainstream appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OktZBM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Plenty of privacy still included with standard purchase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wE7vYu"&gt;Apple might be charging for Private Relay and Hide My Email by bundling them into iCloud subscriptions, but these iCloud Plus additions are still dwarfed by the array of privacy protections already built into Apple’s hardware and software. There’s no sign that any of these existing privacy features will be locked behind a monthly subscription fee anytime soon. Indeed, the list of built-in protections Apple offers continues to grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DvnlgS"&gt;This includes a new Mail Privacy Protection feature in the Mail app in iOS 15, which sends your emails through a relay service to confuse any tracking pixels that might be hiding in them (read more about tracking pixels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681508/tracking-pixel-email-spying-superhuman-web-beacon-open-tracking-read-receipts-location"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). There’s also a new App Privacy Report feature coming to iOS 15 that will show how often apps are accessing your location, camera, microphone, and other data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pHcRXNO6nTE0sIh-lo-fiCFma6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22649702/Apple_iPhone12Pro_settings_privacy_app_privacy_report_060721.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhones’ list of built-in privacy features continues to expand with iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZojtJ"&gt;But with iCloud Plus, Apple now offers two privacy protections that are distinct from those that are included for free with the purchase of a device, and the division between the two seems arbitrary to some extent. Apple justifies charging for features like Private Relay and Hide My Email because of the incremental costs of running those services, but Mail Privacy Protection also relies on a relay server, which presumably isn’t free to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="t46jic"&gt;Regardless of its rationale, choosing to charge for these services means that Apple has opened the door to premium privacy features becoming part of its increasingly important services business, beyond just its hardware business. Adherence to privacy was already part of the company’s attempt to lock you into its devices; now it could become part of the attempt to lock you into its services. All the while, those &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-airpods-macbook-you-live-in-apples-world-heres-what-you-are-missing-11622817653?mod=followjoannastern"&gt;walls around Apple’s garden&lt;/a&gt; creep higher and higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIhUI7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uf8Rp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJDmFx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aaoj9p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLU8A2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lagAh9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
