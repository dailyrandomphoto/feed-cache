    <title>Twitter lets you add Topics to Spaces, but they’re limited to start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lkK2zaLlNDFBaxjB48Rce8JG-dU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904559/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2oTvpo"&gt;Twitter is bringing Topics to Spaces so that hosts can tag their Spaces with up to three relevant Topics, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1441438483717836802"&gt;according to the Spaces Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a small addition to start: there are only 10 Topics to choose from, limited to English, for some people on the Android app. Twitter says it will expand to iOS and add more Topics and languages soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="btNsuS"&gt;The initial 10 Topics — including Entertainment, Gaming, and World News — align with the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20948547/twitter-topics-launch-sports-gaming-entertainment-test"&gt;currently exist across Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, which people can choose to follow to get related content on their timelines. Adding Topics to Spaces brings it even closer to how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; works, with different topics to explore and clubs to join based around those topics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JAJ8wt"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;new in Spaces: Topics!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;when creating or scheduling a Space, some of you on Android can choose up to 3 Topics to tag it with from a list of our top 10 Topics. BUT it’s only 10 Topics for now and we’ll expand as we build together&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;English only (also for now!), iOS soon &lt;a href="https://t.co/6PfbZtwWMH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/6PfbZtwWMH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1441438483717836802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="00vkpm"&gt;One of the nicer things about Twitter is finding people who share your possibly niche interests, so it makes sense to add at least some of its Topics to Spaces. There are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/flow/topics_selector"&gt;several hundred available&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them get pretty specific: you can choose to follow the Topics for Dinosaurs, Bollywood Dance, Drone Racing, Unexplained Phenomena, and Adam Sandler, to name a few. (I’m losing hope that an Antique Glassware Identification Topic will materialize, but that might just be me.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fE72gG"&gt;Twitter has been steadily updating Spaces since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;started testing late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In recent months, it’s begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;rolling out Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and added more options for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640097/twitter-spaces-attending-listening-follow-top-of-feed"&gt;discoverability&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;moderation&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei CFO has reportedly made the plea deal that will finally let her go home</title>

  &lt;p id="7TxP6A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/huawei-cfo-meng-appear-brooklyn-federal-court-2021-09-24/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/meng-wanzhou-us-court-1.6188093"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported that Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou would appear in a Brooklyn federal courtroom today via streaming video and enter a plea regarding US charges against her. Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18128057/huawei-cfo-canada-arrest-iran-sanctions-violation"&gt;arrested the Chinese executive in December 2018&lt;/a&gt; on suspicion of violating US sanctions, and she has remained there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/11/18134938/huawei-cfo-meng-wanzhou-bail-house-arrest-us-china"&gt;on house arrest&lt;/a&gt; ever since, fighting US attempts at extradition. Hearings in her extradition case ended in August, with the ruling scheduled for October 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WKwrEt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/09/24/world/meng-wanzhou-huawei-trial?action=click&amp;amp;pgtype=Article&amp;amp;module=&amp;amp;state=default&amp;amp;region=header&amp;amp;context=breakout_link_back_to_briefing#huawei-meng-wanzhou"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reports that during Meng’s appearance Friday afternoon, she pleaded not guilty to the charges against her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KMWho"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; earlier reported that prosecutors will arrange to defer and later drop the charges in exchange for admitting some wrongdoing, however according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;, that will not include entering a guilty plea. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-reaches-deal-with-huawei-executive-11632494001?st=n81fv8iy9e669cs&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Justice Department officials under the Biden administration revisited negotiations that had broken down under President Trump. Its sources report that Huawei itself is not a part of the deal and will continue to fight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185771/huawei-trade-secrets-charges-federal-investigation"&gt;its charges of fraud and trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKzs4A"&gt;Meng was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201023/us-charges-huawei-fraud-stealing-t-mobile-justice-department"&gt;indicted on fraud charges claiming the Chinese technology and telecommunications company misrepresented its relationship with an Iranian affiliate&lt;/a&gt;, along with accusations it stole intellectual property from T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46hhwq"&gt;Spokespeople for the US Attorney’s Office and Huawei have not commented publicly on the matter. According to the &lt;em&gt;CBC&lt;/em&gt; sources, Meng will pay a fine as part of a plea deal, while &lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;says the agreement reached with US prosecutors will allow her to leave Canada and return to China. A former Canadian diplomat told the &lt;em&gt;CBC &lt;/em&gt;he expects her release would lead to China deporting two Canadians it arrested and charged with espionage following Meng’s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFIHHw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 2:30PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Meng’s court appearance and not guilty plea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Lightning port isn’t about convenience; it’s about control</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="xhSBZJ"&gt;The European Commission shook the iPhone world to its roots this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22626723/eu-commission-universal-charger-usb-c-micro-lightning-connector-smartphones"&gt;announcing a new policy&lt;/a&gt; that would require all smartphones to adopt USB-C ports for physical charging in an effort to reduce e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxSmPd"&gt;Apple, of course, doesn’t offer a USB-C iPhone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/17/21070848/eu-apple-european-commission-common-charger-lightning-cable-port"&gt;having argued to the European Commission in the past&lt;/a&gt; that “Legislation would have a direct negative impact by disrupting the hundreds of millions of active devices and accessories used by our European customers and even more Apple customers worldwide, creating an unprecedented volume of electronic waste and greatly inconveniencing users.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYvKqy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple obviously prefers Lightning to USB-C&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyc1No"&gt;Switching to USB-C, Apple says, would actually be &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; wasteful than sticking with Lightning, since customers would need new cables and adapters — despite the fact that Apple already offers USB-C ports on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/9/8372335/12-inch-macbook-review"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; and has managed to switch over those popular products without major issues or customer revolts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpyaTz"&gt;Notably absent from Apple’s argument, though, is the fact that cutting out a Lightning port on an iPhone wouldn’t just create more e-waste (if you buy Apple’s logic) or inconvenience its customers. It also means that Apple would lose out on the revenue it makes from every Lightning cable and accessory that works with the iPhone, Apple-made or not — along with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/21/3793488/apple-changes-iphone-accessory-guidelines-is-not-standing-in-the-way-of-pop-accessory"&gt;control it has&lt;/a&gt; over what kinds of hardware &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/24/3801436/kickstarter-charging-station-pop-back-on-after-apple-changes-lightning-accessory-rules"&gt;does&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/12/20/3789504/kickstarter-charger-pop-turns-to-competitor-to-process-refunds-apple"&gt;doesn’t&lt;/a&gt;) get to exist for the iPhone and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/3/3451032/apple-lightning-certification-accessory-restrictions"&gt;which companies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-revokes-monsters-authority-to-make-licensed-accessories-1434481512"&gt;get to make them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhZP2X"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://mfi.apple.com/"&gt;MFi program&lt;/a&gt; means that if you want to plug anything into an iPhone, be it charger or adapter or accessory, you have to go through Apple. And Apple takes a cut of every one of those devices, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ca7ugP"&gt;Want to connect an external display? You’ll need an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD826AM%2FA%2Flightning-digital-av-adapter&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Import photos and videos from an SD card or flash drive? An &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMD821AM%2FA%2Flightning-to-usb-camera-adapter%3Ffnode%3Da07275593a4e170d81156b6668259dc502a6abe2eb6c0ce924c9284c8a53605fa614c8df300fda18d0ae87dfa52f3d6da397bb6af24f8704e28a44772c60a3e40378d4927a3ee59ae4e80ca3a9dd46ac61bff748b417b45d1f0991f0acbf0c77a680f4c5607c22125bd513c593c20e34%26fs%3Df%253Dadapter%2526fh%253D458e%25252B45b0&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F24%2F22690338%2Fapple-iphone-lightning-ports-convenience-control-usb-c-eu-wireless-charging-mfi-magsafe" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple-approved adapter&lt;/a&gt;. Want to use a DAC to take advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple Music’s new hi-res lossless audio&lt;/a&gt;? Again, you’ll either need an MFi device or an Apple-approved USB dongle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsr815"&gt;The same, of course, isn’t true of Apple’s USB-C-based devices, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/2/20750137/apple-ipad-pro-usb-c-hubs-hyperdrive-belkin-satechi-kanex"&gt;which have a robust ecosystem&lt;/a&gt; that can broadly be defined as virtually every product that uses USB-C. With a USB-C iPad, you can simply plug in flash drives and keyboards and displays and any number of useful additions that make those devices better. Apple even made a point of that fact during its latest keynote when announcing the new iPad Mini. And of course, USB-C iPads can be charged by any standard USB-C cable that’s capable of putting out enough wattage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjYAaL"&gt;The European Commission's rule could theoretically do the same for iPhones by forcing into existence the USB-C iPhone that Apple has adamantly refused to make thus far. But the new change may mean that Apple could shift towards (or accelerate its plans for) a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307716/apple-lightning-portless-iphone-usb-c-magsafe-charging-kuo-rumor"&gt;completely portless iPhone instead&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than give into USB-C ports, the company could eschew ports entirely in order to shift customers towards using its proprietary charging methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kJVkbU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The EU’s USB-C proposal might give us a portless iPhone instead","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FsqIic"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689432/eu-iphone-usb-c-switch-portless-design"&gt;It’s the sort of solution that seems obvious&lt;/a&gt; — it’s practically an intentional loophole in the EU policy — until you consider how little sense a portless iPhone makes, absent Apple’s desire to defend its accessory fees and ecosystem control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmVHtW"&gt;Switching to USB-C, a standard that’s used by virtually every other major tech product (including many of Apple’s own, like its recent MacBook and IPad lineups) would make sense. The iPhone is possibly the most popular device in the world that uses a proprietary charger, and a switch to USB-C would simplify charging setups for the millions of iPhone owners around the world. And USB-C would still allow for similar waterproofing, data transfer, and charging speeds compared to Lightning (as evidenced by any number of Android phones or Apple’s iPads.) There’s a reason the European Commission is looking to institute the new change, after all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91pWVK"&gt;If the EU allowed Apple to stick with Lightning, keeping that standard around also makes a certain amount of sense, even if it’s frustrating to those (like me) who would prefer a more unified charging standard. Lightning is an established ecosystem that millions of customers already have cables for, with fast data transfer and charging speeds. Like USB-C, it offers waterproofing capabilities, and it gets Apple both its licensing fees and ecosystem control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mz6m3y"&gt;But a portless iPhone that relies on MagSafe (or another wireless standard) is a baffling proposition. It would force millions of customers to have to switch to new chargers, generating tons of e-waste in the process. The result of all that cost and effort would be a charging and data transfer system that is slower and less power efficient in every way compared to wired cables, while also being larger and bulkier than a Lightning or a USB-C wire — just compare the size of one of Apple’s MagSafe cables, or the smallest Qi wireless charger, to a regular wired plug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pLiv34"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple could weather a switch to USB-C just fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erbqvz"&gt;Apple is a $2.4 trillion company; it likely would be just fine without the revenues it gets from Lightning cable fees, should it switch to USB-C entirely. After all, there’s still plenty of proprietary Apple chargers and technologies out there to license, too, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;, AirPlay, Find My, or the rumored new magnetic laptop chargers that may be in the works for later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWMXCq"&gt;But profits aside, a switch to USB-C would mean relinquishing another piece of control over what iPhone owners can do with their devices outside of Apple’s carefully curated walled garden. And that, as we’ve seen time and again, is something that Apple is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"&gt;loath to allow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vwlMwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s been playing it too MagSafe","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"},{"title":"Apple should switch the iPhone to USB-C if it really wants to help the environment","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"},{"title":"Adding USB-C to the iPad isn’t enough to fix Apple’s messy port strategy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/31/18043062/apple-usb-c-ipad-pro-strategy-iphone-macbook-port-dongle"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much that free iPhone really costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aoo6ErNbF9KL1EZXp8uvg7yf2gU=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69904305/lcimg_8043788f_4592_4b97_9d19_6cf11041bc74.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone Pro Max, as announced at the 2021 Apple Event.&lt;/em&gt; | Sean Hollister&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0oPG4N"&gt;With all the carriers dangling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sweet, sweet trade-in and upgrade offers&lt;/a&gt; to essentially give you a “free” iPhone 13 (or two) this year, one can’t help but wonder: which one is the best deal? In this case, that would be the offer that costs you the least money but gets you the iPhone you want. Between all the convoluted conditions and confusing industry jargon, the carriers certainly don’t make it easy to compare different offers or make clear what you’re signing up for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJ8Hta"&gt;Carriers might be eager to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22678111/iphone-13-carrier-promotions-new-signups"&gt;sign up new customers for their bottom lines&lt;/a&gt;, but you need to look out for yours too. After all, is it better to opt for a cheaper unlimited plan that requires a 36-month commitment or get instant trade-in credits to pay a little less sales tax upfront? Should you look for deals that give you instant trade-in credits or get trade-in credits in the form of bill credits over the course of your agreement? It’s sometimes hard to understand all the details until you’ve already signed the contract. To save you the trouble, I took a closer look at the fine print of these deals and did some back-of-the-napkin calculations to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lQYt37"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"},{"title":"iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"},{"title":"How to buy the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22665165/apple-iphone-13-preorder-how-to-buy-price-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Many of the carrier trade-in offers are so aggressive that you can get an iPhone 13 Pro for “free.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EaCcga"&gt;In this case, I wanted to figure out which deal offers the best overall value over the long term. For example, what are my upfront and long-term costs in getting the newest iPhone for as low as free? For the sake of this exercise, I pretended to be a new customer in New York City, shopping for a single phone line, who wants to trade her iPhone 11 for an iPhone 13 or an iPhone 13 Pro,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSsTVt"&gt;Some important caveats about the numbers I’ll be referencing: they are by no means definitive and only serve to demonstrate how these deals work. For one thing, these carrier offers are time-sensitive and may already be different by the time you read this. The specifics of your carrier plan are influenced by many personal factors, like your credit history, your local tax rate, how many lines you need, and any special discounts that you’re eligible for (e.g., military/veteran). I can only present a relatively basic set of numbers that don’t reflect all the many possible variations in the universe, so take my numbers with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMqT8G"&gt;After comparing similar offers from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile / Sprint, Verizon, Apple.com, I’ve noticed a few tips that would help you shop for the best deal for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y1u5JP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My key takeaways...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DX9LdWjvrdsw3twULvMGJi2t2tQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874503/lcimg_998e9575_72ad_4040_91eb_7203d774a004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Sean Hollister&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In some scenarios, it might make sense to pay for a device in full and instant trade-in credits, rather than rely on trade-in credits in the form of bill credits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9wZNK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look at the plans, not the free phone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPPJpa"&gt;Most of the trade-in credits are so high that they basically cover the cost of an iPhone 13 or iPhone 13 Pro — assuming your trade-in device is from the past two years and in good condition. So when you look at these deals, you should not get distracted by the allure of a free iPhone. Instead, focus on the cost of the plan after 24 to 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYHS5M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contract Length Matters Most&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrP3h3"&gt;The duration of the contract has the biggest impact on separating the best value deal from the bad. While AT&amp;amp;T offers the cheapest unlimited plan among its competition ($65/month), after 36 months (the required length you need to have service for to get the best offer), it ended up costing the most money ($2,445.30). Since most of its rivals’ plans are only 24 months long, I did the math on the AT&amp;amp;T plan at 24 months just so that I could compare apples to apples. It turns out the $65-per-month plan is the least expensive one after 24 months ($1,630.20) and is even cheaper than the special promotion between Apple and T-Mobile / Sprint ($1,713.60), which includes an extra $500 discount on the phone when you sign up for the $85 Magenta / Sprint Max plan. It’s worth gaming out the full cost of the plan for the duration of the contract before you sign on the line because this is where you’ll be spending the majority of your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxJeXh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant Trade-in Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQkZL"&gt;If you can pay for the balance of your phone in full at the time of purchase and live near an eligible Apple store, you might want to take advantage of the instant trade-in credits that Apple offers. The beauty of the instant trade-in credit is that you get the value right at the time of purchase, which lowers the sales tax you pay at checkout — unlike the online trade-in process where your device has to be mailed to a third party to be evaluated before its actual value will be credited to your monthly bills in a few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5Jmy6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Trade-offs with Trade-ins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpKrTX"&gt;Although my hypothetical trade-in credit for the iPhone 11 (between $800 and $1,000) effectively renders my monthly device payments to $0, because I am required to be on a monthly device payment plan as part of any trade-in offer, I may not terminate my device plan earlier than 24 months. If I do, I would be responsible for paying for the balance of this “free” iPhone, lose the remaining value from my trade-in device, and (potentially) pay an early termination penalty. Now, if I paid for the device upfront (ideally with an instant trade-in credit), I could choose a plan that better reflects my actual data consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMYJp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hidden Fees&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm4lO4"&gt;In some cases, the carrier might require you to pay a down payment or an activation fee and offer you different contract lengths based on your credit history. While you won’t be paying for your iPhone directly when your trade-in credit kicks in, you still have to pay the sales tax on the full price of the phone — there is no bill credit to reimburse that cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuCwrG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overall Winner: Verizon &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FL7vlP"&gt;Out of all the carrier offers, Verizon actually had the lowest overall costs with its 24-month payment plans, even though it doesn’t have the cheapest 5G plan or the shortest agreement length. At $2,077.36 for the iPhone 13 and $2,086.36 for the iPhone 13 Pro, these totals don’t even include the $500 gift card that Verizon is offering to customers who switch providers. The most expensive carrier offer, on the other hand, is from AT&amp;amp;T and its extra-long 36-month contract. Not only does it cost more of your hard-earned money, but your iPhone 13 will be so out-of-date after three years that you may want to pay to end your contract early. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WcByte"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10766269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yxLCVZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If audio is missing from your Instagram Stories, a fix is here</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwWIgZEdR_WxjciZ0JSrDh4SL40=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69900354/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naTnU7"&gt;Following the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 update&lt;/a&gt;, some users &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;have reported strange behavior on Instagram&lt;/a&gt; — when an iPhone’s ringer switch is set to silent mode, stories play without audio. &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;A new update released on Friday&lt;/a&gt; appears to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVHNp9"&gt;Silent videos might sound like a blessing for friends who love to put every new song Spotify suggests to them in their Instagram Story, but that’s not exactly how the switch is supposed to work. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/psjmqp/anyone_facing_audio_issue_when_phone_is_on_mute/"&gt;Silent mode is primarily meant to control system sounds&lt;/a&gt; like ringtones and text tones, not the audio you hear inside apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fYb3oH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is working on a fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cpFWyN"&gt;Before the update, I was able to recreate the behavior on my own iPhone running iOS 15. For some users, the issue popped up even earlier during the public beta of Apple’s software update. It’s not clear if this issue impacted users running older versions of iOS, and Facebook didn’t confirm if the issue was specifically related to iOS 15. The company did provide the following statement promising a fix, however:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dRYHtH"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble hearing their audio in Instagram Stories. We’re working to fix this issue as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8KO1BY"&gt;As of Friday, &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/instagram/id389801252"&gt;the update is available to download&lt;/a&gt;, and at least on my device, the problem is gone. Audio plays in Instagram Stories with the ringer off after a press of the volume button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC4ENM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 9/24 12:48PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Instagram’s update that fixes the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BChkja"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7SQeS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China’s central bank bans cryptocurrency transactions to avoid ‘risks’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s86HgiiJu25QCboxUsPaX7n1A94=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903772/acastro_bitcoin_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZowYTL"&gt;The People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank, &lt;a href="http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4348556/index.html"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; that cryptocurrency transactions are illegal, saying such currencies “do not have legal tender status” and therefore “cannot be circulated as currency in the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnH7Fk"&gt;In a statement, the bank said that bitcoin and other virtual currency transactions have disrupted economic and financial order, contributing to a rise in “money laundering, illegal fund-raising, fraud, pyramid schemes, and other illegal and criminal activities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qW3flT"&gt;Crypto transactions are now considered criminal financial activity in China, the bank said, and the country will “resolutely curb the hype of virtual currency transactions, severely crack down on illegal financial activities and illegal criminal activities related to virtual currencies, protect the safety of the people’s property in accordance with the law, and make every effort to maintain economic and financial order and social stability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXuPEk"&gt;Friday’s announcement is the culmination of an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;crackdown on crypto&lt;/a&gt; in the country; the Chinese government began issuing warnings about trading in mining cryptocurrencies in May, and in June, the bank &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/06/21/china-says-banks-must-block-crypto-transactions-market-falls/"&gt;told financial institutions&lt;/a&gt; to stop processing digital currency transactions. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-24/china-deems-all-crypto-related-transactions-illegal-in-crackdown?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that one major reason for the Chinese crackdown on cryptocurrencies is the amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;energy needed to mine cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; transactions. China is in the midst of an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/global-energy-crunch-leaves-china-facing-more-power-shortages?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;energy crisis&lt;/a&gt; that has already affected many other industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOBaWY"&gt;Cryptocurrency prices were down &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTC-USD?sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwifoYvH75fzAhXkF1kFHUmRC0YQ-fUHegQICBAS"&gt;sharply in late-morning trading&lt;/a&gt; following China’s announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The iPhone 13 Mini still gets slower MagSafe charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KWeuXMt7N7rde9EUNmOF4cRROwU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903718/vpavic_210918_4760_0703.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HLI4SC"&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini is out Friday, and while it has a number of welcome improvements over the 12 Mini, it shares one limitation with its predecessor: the 13 Mini is still limited to peak power delivery of up 12 watts over MagSafe wireless charging, according to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211829"&gt;an Apple support document&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/23/iphone-13-mini-12w-magsafe/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). That means it, like the 12 Mini, has a lower maximum MagSafe charging speed than the rest of the iPhone 13 lineup, which can all charge at up to 15 watts over MagSafe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHvjDm"&gt;While it might be disappointing to hear that the smallest iPhone can charge slower over MagSafe, it does have improved battery life. Apple says you should get up to 1.5 hours more battery life than you would with the iPhone 12 Mini, so you may not need to charge the 13 Mini as often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MASWUp"&gt;That said, the 13 Mini offers less battery life than the rest of the iPhone 13 models, and it can still run out quickly. Here’s Dieter Bohn’s early impressions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;from his review&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Gig work is precarious no matter the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Zomato delivery man seen riding along the streets of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_FTUMnl_OSix0Ze1lmEqhSAkdaU=/0x0:3978x2652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903538/1233964644.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YV0bBA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22667600/delivery-workers-seamless-uber-relay-new-york-electric-bikes-apps"&gt;The lives of delivery workers in major US cities&lt;/a&gt; are dangerous, surprisingly expensive, and largely only possible because of the support app-based laborers offer each other. But a &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;new editorial series from &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that the experiences of US-based gig workers aren’t unique — trying to make a living while at the whims of indifferent platforms is difficult no matter what country you’re in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZCTJu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s overview is based on a survey of over 4,000 gig workers across the world. The publication’s findings are extensive — there’s plenty to examine from just about every angle you can imagine — but &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/gig-workers-around-the-world-are-finally-organizing/"&gt;the similarities drawn between workers in different countries&lt;/a&gt; is striking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="GOCQDu"&gt;Many [workers] — more than 60% — said that they were financially satisfied. But, at the same time, 62% also said that they were frequently anxious and scared on the job, afraid of accidents, assaults, illness, or simply not making enough money to cover their costs. More than two-thirds of the workers surveyed by &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; said they want out within a year. More than a quarter said they were planning on quitting within a month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="J5c5c9"&gt;Those parallels appeared in another aspect of platform work the series analyzes: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-how-platforms-set-women-up-to-fail/"&gt;the treatment of women in the gig economy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; found women’s historically marginalized status in traditional economies was replicated on apps and platforms. &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;survey indicated&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;women worked fewer hours — and many had caregiving duties on top of gig work. They also worked lower-paying gigs and “earned less overall ... than their male counterparts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsDdSU"&gt;The gig economy’s strangling, kudzu vine-like spread is &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-investors-behind-gig-work-model/"&gt;largely possible because of massive sums of money from investment funds&lt;/a&gt; and, sometimes, other platform companies. Individual profiles included in the series further highlight that reach: &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-telemedicine-doctor-india/"&gt;a doctor working on a telehealth app&lt;/a&gt; in India, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/global-gig-workers-delivery-driver-south-korea/"&gt;a delivery worker dealing with back pain&lt;/a&gt; in South Korea, and more. There’s too much to possibly summarize in one place, which is all the more reason why you should &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/the-global-gig-workers/"&gt;check out the entire &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; series here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHXepk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGV77r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="akcmkp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aynC8Q"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Grimes are now ‘semi-separated’</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KftewP"&gt;Elon Musk and Claire “Grimes” Boucher have “semi-separated,” according to the SpaceX founder. Musk &lt;a href="https://pagesix.com/2021/09/24/elon-musk-and-grimes-break-up-after-three-years-together"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;that the two would continue to co-parent their one-year-old son, X Æ A-Xii, but that working in different parts of the country had led to them taking more separate paths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MIyMno"&gt;“We are semi-separated but still love each other, see each other frequently, and are on great terms,” Musk told &lt;em&gt;Page Six&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas, and her work is primarily in LA. She’s staying with me now, and Baby X is in the adjacent room.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcHUCw"&gt;The two started dating in 2018 after an exchange about a thought experiment popular in the tech world known as &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/evkgvz/what-is-rokos-basilisk-elon-musk-grimes"&gt;Roko’s Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;, and quickly became one of the more unusual couples in their shared domain of tech-pop-space-travel-AI-and-miscellaneous. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcStJR"&gt;They made their debut together on the red carpet of&lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/05/elon-musk-grimes-met-gala"&gt; the Met Gala in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, though they arrived separately at this year’s event. The pair had a child together in May last year named X Æ A-Xii, baffling many with the pronunciation of the name (it’s “X Ash A 12,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/5/7/21251107/elon-musk-baby-name-x-ae-a-12-grimes-son-pronunciation"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;). They worked together when Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427429/elon-musk-snl-clips-wario-dogecoin-monologue-saturday-night-live"&gt;hosted &lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a sketch in which the billionaire tech founder played Wario, and the pop star appeared as Princess Peach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlBMYb"&gt;Grimes &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-elon-musk-union-controversy-simply-unprepared-2464497"&gt;has&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1262804/grimes-fiercely-defends-elon-musk-from-critics-amid-claim-he-is-destroying-the-planet-and-humanity"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/grimes-takes-to-tiktok-to-defend-elon-musk-again-i-am-not-my-bfs-spokesperson-3025309"&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; Musk against criticisms of his work, including the anti-union practices of Tesla (in 2019, a judge found that Musk and other Tesla executives &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/identities/2019/9/30/20891314/elon-musk-tesla-labor-violation-nlrb"&gt;illegally sabotaged&lt;/a&gt; employees’ attempts to form a union). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making Elizabeth Holmes’ cringey texts public is the ultimate crime deterrent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Executives Elizabeth Holmes And Sunny Balwani Return To Court" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JkeWf3YDYCAWK21RJMi8WAW8Qx0=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69903373/1158861261.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pcbooj"&gt;The Elizabeth Holmes trial has made me more determined than ever to avoid doing crimes. I’ll be sticking to the law from here on out, thank you very much. It’s not for any noble reason — I don’t have any new sense of morality or sudden desire to be a very good person. No, I am zealously sticking to the law because doing crimes could, theoretically, put me in the same position disgraced Theranos founder Holmes is in right now: having my text message history revealed in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFREXJ"&gt;Dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/elizabeth-holmes-trial-theranos/card/TxB90dEbjHdvfu8KEjdl"&gt;text messages&lt;/a&gt; between Holmes and her ex-boyfriend (and ex-business partner) Sunny Balwani were read aloud during Holmes’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684354/elizabeth-holmes-trial-wire-fraud-theranos"&gt;trial for fraud&lt;/a&gt; this week. Thousands were released by the prosecution and more were &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/22/elizabeth-holmes-private-text-messages-leak-during-theranos-fraud-trial.html"&gt;obtained by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the messages talked about problems with the blood testing technology, which might help prosecutors show that Holmes knew that they didn’t work as advertised. Others were much more... personal. Like when Holmes texted Balwani “you are the breeze in desert for me.” Now, along with the “might go to jail” thing, Holmes has to live with the knowledge that everyone knows she sent that text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8N3O7W"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I would plead guilty to crimes I didn’t even commit before I let this get read aloud in court jfc&lt;/p&gt;— Maladroithe (@Maladroithe) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Maladroithe/status/1440826183365455876?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wQW3fw"&gt;I am not sure if I’m being hyperbolic when I say that is my very worst nightmare. I can confidently say that I’ve never told someone that they’re the breeze in the desert, but my text history is still embarrassing as hell. Isn’t everyone’s? Mine is full of bad tweets and shit talking and screenshots that should never, ever see the light of day. Searching for the word “murder” in iMessage brings up dozens of results, most of which are in conversations about online dating. Here are some moderately-cringe-but-not-too-terrible messages I’ve sent recently:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Why does he look like a caricature of what Jonathan Franzen should look like. Does that make sense" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9cpdBjLyvN675SI1ZMN6EROb1Hk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874847/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.27_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this embarrassing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Text message reading: Wow ya. Twilight is so relevant" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NcxP4LIm-ts4yht_gcYg_YJUfT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22874856/Screen_Shot_2021_09_24_at_9.47.51_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay, I stand by this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qCO0kM"&gt;And I got to carefully curate these! I got to comb through and pick only a few messages that I thought would help communicate that I am someone who sends somewhat embarrassing texts but am not TOO weird. Holmes just had everything dumped on the internet, for anyone to see. I asked a friend what she would do if that happened to her. “Hang myself I assume,” she responded, in another dubious (and to be clear, exaggerated)&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;entry into both of our iMessage histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6kU8E"&gt;If very high-profile public trials like this one can be a deterrent against other people committing crimes like the ones Holmes is accused of, this one is working. I can confidently say I will not develop an inaccurate medical testing device and defraud investors. I am going to be very, very good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="io4zyv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
