    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some standout options for multiple budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y2YM1c"&gt;If you don’t already have a laptop with a built-in webcam — or the one on your laptop isn’t very good — you might need a standalone webcam. Maybe it’s to be able to show your face during work or school. Maybe it’s for chatting with friends, or for side projects, like live streaming or recording yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBM2l"&gt;If you don’t want to actually purchase a webcam, there are several routes to take. You can get crafty with your phone (and spend hardly anything or nothing at all) by using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;an app that’ll fool your computer into thinking it’s a webcam&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can go in the total opposite direction and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"&gt;connect a pricey DSLR or mirrorless camera to your computer&lt;/a&gt; to use as a webcam — a very good one, at that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="599LPF"&gt;But assuming you simply want to purchase a webcam, our goal is to make it easier for you to find the one that matches your needs and your budget. Here, I aim to decipher which USB webcams are worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBTZqs"&gt;We tested popular models from brands like Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, Razer, Elgato, and more. Once the dust settled, we landed on a semi-affordable webcam that we think is the best option for most people. That’s the Logitech C920S Pro HD, which usually costs about $60. It supports 1080p resolution capture at 30 frames per second, and the visual quality is satisfactory in most lighting conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UX8PIq"&gt;If you have some extra cash along with a desire for better video quality and more features, check out Logitech’s StreamCam. It also supports 1080p resolution, but with a faster 60 frames per second capture. This model is loaded with clever features, like an optional mode that can automatically follow your face around the frame. It also ships with versatile mounts, one for your monitor, and another for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjCOUJ"&gt;Each camera’s video quality was judged by using it with Zoom (where footage is prone to compression, as it is with other web-based video calling apps), as well as with OBS Studio or VLC to see how it compares with a locally-stored recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C920S Pro HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oq6w_fn8r2h5nt8UsnLMp8XGhe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820369/akrales_210831_4734_0071.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0UZo0O"&gt;Logitech C920S Pro HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HMMN3w"&gt;The best webcam for most people &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta46G2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EamdYO"&gt;Usually priced around $60, Logitech’s C920S Pro HD provides better video and mic quality than others that I tested in this price range. This model can record in 1080p resolution at up to 30 frames per second, and while you won’t have an issue finding other similarly-priced webcams with those specs, the C920S Pro’s out-of-box color balance, exposure, and relatively fast auto-focus made it stand out from others I tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06NWy7"&gt;The picture quality has sufficient detail, and even in my relatively dark apartment, the C920S Pro had no trouble making my facial features look sharp. But it wasn’t a flawless presentation overall, as is to be expected for the price. In less-than-ideal lighting scenarios, the C920S Pro made my skin look over-saturated, with red spots where the webcam couldn’t compensate for the lack of lighting. Though in a work or play environment flush with natural light, this was noticeably less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQpq4s"&gt;Picture quality aside, the C920S Pro has several welcome features, like a generous 78-degree field of view, status lights that activate when the webcam is being used by an application, and an included privacy shutter that can give you assurance that you’re not broadcasting unless you want to be. Some other nice features at this price include its strong articulating stand, which can sit atop your monitor or just as easily screw into a tripod. It’s just a great value for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ai4Ksm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M8JI8o"&gt;Other webcam options you might like for under $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Modern Webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbDixIE4MNptXeWGqq88TlPL1zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820368/akrales_210831_4734_0069.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1XjelV"&gt;Microsoft Modern Webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1XE3Yk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, and in a more limited fashion, macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdNNIx"&gt;Like the Logitech C920S Pro, the Modern Webcam promises 1080p resolution recording at up to 30 frames per second. Compared directly to the Logitech, Microsoft’s webcam didn’t produce as sharp of an image. It was, however, able to produce a more true-to-life look for my lighting scenario thanks to its HDR setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xajEUQ"&gt;HDR has some benefits, but it might also come with a few cons depending on your lighting. While the Modern Webcam did an admirable job of taming the pretty intense backlight that I have behind me during the day, it didn’t seem to have many tricks to make me look my best in other ways (at least without tweaking the picture with the Microsoft Accessory Center app). Through the lens of the Modern Webcam, I looked like I work in a dimly-lit basement apartment — which I do, but I’d rather not be reminded of that fact. As with the C920S Pro, this should be less of a problem for people who have no shortage of natural light in their room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owpuJl"&gt;I appreciate that the Modern Webcam’s stand lets you hang it over a monitor, or screw it into a tripod. And it gets bonus points for having a physical privacy slider. This webcam also has a built-in microphone, but it strangely isn’t enabled by default. If you’re using Windows 10, you’ll need to download and enable that setting within the aforementioned Accessory Center app. If you’re using a macOS computer, well, you’re stuck with a webcam that lacks a microphone. Considering that this webcam costs $69.99, I think you’re better off with Logitech’s C920S Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJKItV"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C270 HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-y1NE1SxqTFm7HCPEo8x-3mj1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820367/akrales_210831_4734_0062.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h6Ocsh"&gt;Logitech C270 HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a0ZCZM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, macOS, Android, Chrome OS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nsz1XC"&gt;If you’re really in a pinch, and your main requirements in a webcam are simply that it’s reliable, very affordable, and it has a microphone, you might want to check out the Logitech C270 HD. It’s by no means a stunner when it comes to video quality — it’s only capable of 720p resolution at 30 frames per second — so you’ll get a fairly fuzzy image no matter what your lighting situation is. You’ll get the best picture if you have it connected in a well-lit environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLaENJ"&gt;The C270 HD’s bulkier design will likely overlap your monitor’s screen, unlike the options above. It’s a minor consolation that its monitor mount doubles as a stand of sorts, so it can hold itself up on your desk or a table. Being an affordable webcam doesn’t mandate that it shouldn’t have good design, though, so hopefully Logitech improves this aspect in particular for the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piS4zR"&gt;This isn’t the most glowing recommendation, but I understand that spending more isn’t something that some people may want to do. Most people should spend $60 on our top pick, but if you just want something that gets the job done without making a large investment, the C270 HD will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJMDzD"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730561"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech StreamCam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nh1GFyxuwOqYABKQWVCaktQzGYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820366/akrales_210831_4734_0060.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9eDY3g"&gt;Logitech Streamcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fmc0AB"&gt;The best webcam for people who need better picture quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BffJel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpcJPD"&gt;If you’re comfortable spending somewhere in the $150-$200 price range, your webcam selection will open up to devices that have sharper picture quality and other features that may make them worth the extra cost. Logitech’s Streamcam isn’t the newest webcam to be released, but it stands out as being a great value overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEyIJ0"&gt;For one, it’s compact, and its picture fidelity can reach 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. To my eyes, the Streamcam had only slightly improved clarity, exposure, and color reproduction over the cheaper C920S Pro mentioned above. But it easily takes the win with its much more fluid capture at 60fps. The Streamcam also has a built-in dual omnidirectional mic and a fast auto-focus feature. For people who’d rather have a fixed focus webcam that isn’t constantly searching for objects in motion, Logitech’s Capture software lets you switch off the auto-focus, in addition to several other picture-tweaking settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8I6mT"&gt;These are all great to have (and what you should expect in a $100+ webcam), but it’s the extra features that put this one at the top. The Streamcam can record in landscape or portrait mode, which may save you a step when you edit clips that are made for mobile viewing. It includes two stands, one that can mount it to a tripod and another, more flexible one that rests on your monitor. The latter stand supports a generous amount of vertical tilt, as well as panning from left to right. Lastly, the Capture software allows you to activate an AI feature that can follow your face as it moves within the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djm8fC"&gt;If you have an older laptop, one aspect of the Streamcam that might cause trouble is that it plugs in via USB-C. So, if your computer doesn’t have a USB-C port, you’ll need to purchase a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Also, there are other higher-end webcams that offer wider fields of view than the Streamcam’s 78 degrees, so you may want to look elsewhere if you want to capture an image that encompasses more of your room or desk setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MrH5U6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NlGSTH"&gt;Other options you might like in the $100-$200 range&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-DPVsE7UXl4CXq1faIpRT8hGmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820364/akrales_210831_4734_0054.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5BtEmd"&gt;Elgato Facecam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gC1SzH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYdPD"&gt;The Streamcam is a tough webcam to beat, yet Elgato’s Facecam comes close. It has a great balance of performance and features — offering slightly better-looking video quality than Logitech’s webcam — but its lack of a microphone combined with its higher, $199 price tag makes it tough to recommend to most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYt6rS"&gt;The Facecam has similar specs to the Streamcam. It can record at 1080p with up to 60 frames per second, and you can customize how you look in its companion software. After some tweaking to the many settings in Elgato’s Camera Hub app, I preferred how the Facecam made me look with my lighting setup (though its default settings out of the box weren’t great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXdHAX"&gt;There are a few problems, though, minor as they might seem to some people. As I’ve already mentioned, the Facecam costs a little more, and for the price, its lack of a microphone surprised me, even if it may not be an issue for people who already use a standalone mic or a headset. And the Facecam’s boxy design won’t exactly blend in with every setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CtsdR"&gt;Despite its flaws, there is a lot to like here. The Facecam supports an 82-degree field of view that’s a little wider than the Streamcam’s, and the fixed focus means that the lens won’t be constantly going in and out of focus as you move around. The Facecam also produces footage that looks noticeably less grainy than any other webcam that I tested for this guide. Some other things I like about this model are that it includes a privacy cap and the webcam itself has a tripod thread on its bottom, so you can easily mount it to a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WX61Qw"&gt;Whether you’re willing to forgive the Facecam for its lack of a mic, or if it wasn’t a problem for you in the first place, I’d still recommend waiting until this one drops a bit in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkCwjk"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730597"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETDO0EbRLO_teCpl8gQY18XtOd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820363/akrales_210831_4734_0051.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Op5sXu"&gt;Dell UltraSharp webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkwn4q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMV9Vn"&gt;Dell’s new, cylindrical-shaped Ultrasharp webcam is another option with no microphone and a high price. But judging on looks alone, Dell’s seems worth the $199. The Ultrasharp is well-constructed, and includes two stands (one monitor mount, one tripod mount) that can magnetically snap into its bottom, making the setup very simple. It also ships with a privacy cap that snaps on magnetically. It looks and feels like a $200 webcam should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMXeW"&gt;Surprisingly, though, the Ultrasharp presented the worst out-of-the-box performance of the webcams that I tried. Making adjustments using the Dell Peripheral companion app definitely helped to bring the quality more into the territory that I expected, considering the high price. This model is capable of 4K resolution capture at up to 30 frames per second, and if you want more frames per second, it gives you the option to bump it down to 1080p resolution to get 60 frames per second. Despite having similar specs to some of the devices above, the Ultrasharp yields footage that’s a little blurry and grainy, and bumping down the resolution to 1080p didn’t seem to yield the advertised 60fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cRiPg"&gt;That said, it does have some features that you may be seeking out. Like the Streamcam, there’s an AI-driven feature that can keep you in the frame as you move around. It also supports Windows Hello facial recognition for logging into your machine securely. If you want a wide field of view, the Ultrasharp supports up to 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpzTA0"&gt;All in all, while the Ultrasharp might appeal to people who want a fancy-looking webcam with some interesting features, unfortunately, the overall performance doesn’t match the fit and finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84Foww"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsa07uaWlsBlRq4jP_gypkLSwMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22319958/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b84tbO"&gt;Razer Kiyo Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hAbxOa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRVqwt"&gt;The differentiating feature of the lens-shaped $199 Kiyo Pro, compared to other higher-end webcams, is its super-wide 103-degree field of view. It allows you to see more of your work or play space, as well as more of you. It can also be set to 80 degrees or 90 degrees, if you want to tweak the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ur5tIT"&gt;Otherwise, its specs will look familiar if you’ve made it this far down the guide. It supports 1080p capture at 60 frames per second, and there’s an HDR mode that knocks the framerate down to 30fps in exchange for a more balanced-looking image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features"&gt;During my testing earlier in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it did a better job than the webcam that I’ve used the most during the pandemic: the one built into my 2019 MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzxHbZ"&gt;That’s underselling it a bit, though. It’s basically on par with the Logitech Streamcam in its ability to produce a satisfying picture with good exposure, although the image was fuzzier than I would have liked for the price. Picture quality aside, the build quality is excellent, and its stand lets you easily mount it on your monitor, or attach it to a tripod. But, this might be a more attractive option if it’s discounted.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Feds to close unit that monitored Americans’ social media for Census disinformation</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzardJk9R3qbR_BD0lLDnJkPmVE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814105/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A rogue Commerce Dept. unit will be shut down, the agency said | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A1oOW"&gt;The US Commerce Department &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/09/us-department-commerce-accepts-findings-and-recommendations"&gt;said Friday&lt;/a&gt; that it will eliminate an internal security division after an investigation found it had overstepped its authority when it launched criminal investigations into Commerce employees and US citizens. The Investigations and Threat Management Service division had no “adequate legal authority” to conduct criminal investigations, according to an internal investigation by the Commerce Department’s Office of General Counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnCPXA"&gt;The investigators recommended that the ITMS unit be eliminated within 90 days, and that its security duties be folded into other Commerce divisions. The Commerce Department said in a statement it would accept the report’s recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLvQRn"&gt;“Our most important priority is creating an environment at the Department of Commerce where employees feel safe and respected,” Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in the statement. “We are committed to maintaining our security, but also equally committed to protecting the privacy and civil liberties of our employees and the public.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL6Sye"&gt;The internal review found that ITMS was managed poorly, but said in the report it had “not found any firsthand or documentary evidence that racial, ethnic, or national origin bias motivated any specific cases,” as had been alleged. The investigation was able to confirm that “ITMS engaged in broad searches of Department of Commerce servers for particular phrases and words in Mandarin as part of talent recruitment investigations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdXXDY"&gt;In addition to eliminating ITMS, the investigators recommended Commerce “discontinue the criminal law enforcement function that was part of ITMS’s mission, clarify that the Department does not possess the authority to conduct counterintelligence activities, and redistribute other remaining functions of ITMS to other offices.” The report also recommended closing and archiving ITMS cases, and destroying the information ITMS collected —  “to ensure that no information developed by ITMS records inform future decisions without a prior legal review and independent factual corroboration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hYvrGN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"‘Rogue’ Commerce unit scanned social media for Census disinformation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451494/commerce-unit-surveillance-privacy-social-media-twitter-senate"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="CSmKWm"&gt;ITMS was the subject of a Congressional investigation earlier this year. In May, Sen. Roger Wicker, (R-Mississippi), the ranking Republican on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, released a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536492/ITMS_Fact_Sheet_05_18_2021_FINAL.pdf"&gt;fact sheet detailing a Congressional investigation into the ITMS&lt;/a&gt; that began in February. Wicker’s memo claimed that ITMS “surveilled social media activity on Twitter to monitor accounts that posted commentary critical of processes used to conduct the US Census.” &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2021/05/24/commerce-department-monitoring-itms/"&gt;first to report&lt;/a&gt; on ITMS’ activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FNFZND"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451494/commerce-unit-surveillance-privacy-social-media-twitter-senate"&gt;According to the Wicker memo&lt;/a&gt;, ITMS conducted the social media probes in an effort to demonstrate its “intelligence-gathering capabilities by linking those accountholders— members of the general public — to disinformation campaigns orchestrated by foreign governments.” There was no evidence that an effort to discredit the Census existed, however. The improper activity at ITMS dated back to the mid 2000s, according to Wicker’s memo, and only two of ITMS’ investigations resulted in criminal charges, according to Friday’s Commerce report.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Watch Series 6 is $140 off at Amazon today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="There’s a new “artist” watch face" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4HJwQcNVPdT4K7LU0RJ5AAO2O8I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814012/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The LTE-ready Apple Watch Series 6 is available at Amazon for its lowest price to date. | Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIRNgQ"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22654621/apple-watch-series-7-new-watchfaces-bigger-screens"&gt;may arrive as soon as this month&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for a sizable discount on what is currently the latest model, you’ll love today’s deal. The red &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5FXJN6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm, cellular Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; is filled with slick features and is on sale at Amazon today for $359 instead of $499, an all-time low for this particular model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSGDbp"&gt;Apple’s newest wearable boasts built-in sleep tracking and an always-on display, as well as sensors that can quickly measure blood oxygen levels. There is also an abundance of third-party apps designed to attract a variety of activities — even biking. The Series 6 is powered by Apple’s new in-house A13 chip and S6 processor; it also charges faster than other models — gaining a full charge takes about 1.5 hours — while battery life remains at 18 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBiUXq"&gt;The red model offers the steepest discount, but the blue and gold versions are also on sale for $380 and $387, respectively. There are also deals available for the larger 44mm sizes. The red model watch is currently out of stock, but you can still place an order at the discounted price, with shipments set to arrive later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5rdm5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVDZQV"&gt;If you want one of the best pairs of Jabra earbuds on the market but don’t want to pay for the Elite 85t, this is the deal for you. An older version of the aforementioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Elite 85t&lt;/a&gt;, the Elite 75t aren’t actually too dissimilar from their successor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CM1W7"&gt;True, the Elite 85t boasts slightly better noise cancellation and are more comfortable to wear for long periods of time. Yet there isn’t a huge difference in sound quality between the two, and both are capable of connecting to two devices simultaneously. In fact, the 75t’s battery life is actually slightly longer (7.5 hours) with ANC off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esrzps"&gt;That’s why &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfvqQ5dC0d6#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fjabra-elite-75t-true-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-in-ear-headphones-black%2F6376030.p%3FskuId%3D6376030&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; shaving $50 off the normally $150 earbuds is a great one. Instead of forking out $230 on the Elite 85t (which, we should add, are also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently on sale for $180&lt;/a&gt;), you can buy a similar pair for more than half off at $100. Jabra intends to phase out the 75t by the end of the year with the introduction of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — Elite 7 Pro, Elite 7 Active, and Elite 3 — so this may be your last chance to pick them up before they become unavailable. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YaPBfg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTRBQH"&gt;Normally $180, Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 is currently available in black at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $158&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price ever. The Series 2 makes it easy to customize buttons, and the new built-in, rechargeable battery should last for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Praiseworthy design improvements like wrap-around grips also make the controller easier to hold, while adjustable-tension thumbsticks, the option to use shorter hair-trigger locks, and support for both USB-C and Bluetooth round out the controller’s hallmarks. It’s even compatible with the Xbox Series X, as well as the Xbox One and Windows 10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7FaNWf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732463"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RtAYLv"&gt;Need a way to store your login details securely? Well, for a limited time, readers of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; can enjoy 50 percent off their first year of 1Password when they sign up for either an individual subscription or a family plan. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619846/1password-8-macos-early-access-password-manager-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;newly-redesigned password manager&lt;/a&gt; ensures that you’ll never have to worry about forgetting your sign-in details, especially since it works on unlimited devices. Security features like authenticated encryption and notifications also alert you to compromised sites and vulnerable passwords, keeping your data is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8nnNz"&gt;Individual subscribers normally pay $2.99 a month or around $36 per year, but with our exclusive deal, you can pay only $1.50 a month for up to a year. Those who opt for the family plan will pay $30 a year instead of the usual $60, or $2.50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Labor Day 2021 TV deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NhDrIiKtRgjE6OJmLVzuo_MMsyQ=/0x20:1440x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69810478/samsung_tv.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TajWIq"&gt;Labor Day in the US is a great opportunity to get deals on many types of tech products. Of course, we’re covering all of the best discounts across categories in our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22652876/best-labor-day-sales-2021-tech-deals-tvs-laptops-headphones"&gt;best Labor Day sales&lt;/a&gt;, but we’ve made this post just to focus on the many 4K TV deals happening this weekend. There are deals on value-focused models that make it easy to get started right away with streaming TV and movie content, as well as TVs that have high-end features and a higher cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iv1ies"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on affordable 4K TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AtFjV"&gt;TCL is usually known for TVs that come with Roku TV hardware built-in, but has started more recently to put out models that run on Android TV. Not to be confused with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;the even newer Google TV-equipped models&lt;/a&gt; that have a microphone built into the TV, you can get the 55-inch version of its midrange 4-Series for $400 at Best Buy (normally $500). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vmprby"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYcP37"&gt;For an even bigger TV, Hisense’s A6G 4K model sells for a similar price to the TCL above, and also runs on Android TV software. This model has a 60Hz refresh rate display, but it features an auto low-latency mode for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYBfFR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YQEkOu"&gt;The best Labor Day deals on high-end 4K TVs &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eIwSX6"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch Bravia XR LED 4K TV — which has full-array backlighting for more accurate lighting, particularly when handling darker scenes — is $1,200 at Best Buy, a cool $100 off its normal list price. This TV has a 120Hz refresh rate and one of its four HDMI ports is HDMI 2.1, supporting 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. And it ships with Google TV software built-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vo0aYj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10732366"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P2CHSa"&gt;For a TV that doesn’t actually look like a conventional display, check out Samsung’s Frame TV. It’s designed to look like, well, you’ve probably already guessed it. The Frame is a competent TV, though, with a 120Hz refresh rate, but its more noteworthy feature is that it can display art while in ambient mode to become more of a conversation piece than a conversation killer. Right now, the 55-inch model is available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1749927639433300823#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for just shy of $1,300, its second-best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVVLmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iLqhEk"&gt;If you want an OLED without an obscenely high price tag, a good place to start is with LG’s A1. The 55-inch version is $300 off its usual $1,600 price at Best Buy, and, unlike the pricier C1, the A1 has a 60Hz refresh rate display. That’s not a flaw if you primarily plan to watch movies or TV on your new TV, but gamers may want the 120Hz refresh rate screen in the C1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H2PdLO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10596459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0eBk5v"&gt;That said, if you have an extra $200 or so to spend, you should upgrade to the C1 for that 120Hz refresh rate. Normally $1,800, it’s currently $1,497 at Amazon and just a few dollars more at Best Buy. This is one of LG’s finest 2020 OLED models, complete with HDMI 2.1 ports that can display up to 4K resolution and 120 frames per second with some games and consoles. It’s also Nvidia G-Sync-ready, if you plan to connect it to a powerful gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HCIfNh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uG1JAH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Christopher Lloyd plays Rick Sanchez in new Rick and Morty promo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tgoM2SE8MtFPJwsmXFjVcRuPjjs=/460x0:2611x1434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813954/Screen_Shot_2021_09_03_at_11.04.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Adult Swim&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zn6beB"&gt;A brief new promo for Adult Swim’s &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; features Christopher Lloyd playing the titular Rick Sanchez, scratching an itch that has persisted for many fans since the show’s genesis as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F97680161&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22655890%2Frick-morty-christopher-lloyd-season-five-finale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Back to the Future&lt;/em&gt; spoof&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keJXDn"&gt;In the 14-second clip, we see Lloyd hop out of a portal and into his garage alongside Jaeden Martell (&lt;em&gt;Knives Out, It&lt;/em&gt;), playing a pretty convincing Morty. Lloyd then does his best riff on Han Solo’s famous line from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&lt;/em&gt;, with a signature Rick Sanchez belch added for good measure: “Morty, we’re home.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XURRX9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;C-132 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/rickandmorty?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#rickandmorty&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oq54C9C5TW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oq54C9C5TW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— adult swim (@adultswim) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/adultswim/status/1433784399460552712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="INPqyV"&gt;Aside from an “aw, jeez” from Martell, that’s it. There’s no explicit mention of whether this is an allusion to a potential Lloyd cameo in Sunday’s season five finale, or if it’s just another quick one-off clip — which the &lt;a href="https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/new-rick-and-morty-anime-short/"&gt;showrunners have made a number of over the years&lt;/a&gt;. The clip is accompanied on Adult Swim’s various social media accounts by “C-132,” though, which is how different universes within the show are named. &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;’s main storyline takes place in universe C-137. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gP0nJK"&gt;Does that multiversal proximity mean anything? Seems like fans will have to wait until Sunday night to find out. Casting Lloyd as Sanchez for part of an actual episode would feel like a fun way to close the loop on the series... if &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty’s&lt;/em&gt; creators weren’t contracted to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17340164/rick-morty-adult-swim-70-episode-renewal"&gt;dozens more episodes in the coming years&lt;/a&gt;. Even if it’s just for this promo, though, it’s a nice nod to the show’s origins, and a satisfying one at that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karl Poyzer on his creative journey, finding joy in 3D, and creating a Vimeo staff pick </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z9eAGpPyZR9mdtYDzjaK4tLyMTE=/306x0:1920x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813838/karl_poyzer_screenshot_2021_08_11_at_23_23_18.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Karl Poyzer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How a director of photography learned to create without physical limits&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XiB1qJ"&gt;Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many artists have had their mediums closed off to them. With the limitations set on production teams and the complex logistics of getting back on set, some artists have had to find new ways to express themselves — like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/karl_poyzer?lang=en"&gt;Karl Poyzer&lt;/a&gt;, a director of photography who took the time during the pandemic to dive into 3D artwork in Blender, with the goal of having fun and doing things his own way. This track would not only allow him to develop a fan base and fresh style but also to start a short film series, &lt;em&gt;Floaters&lt;/em&gt;, that won a Vimeo Staff pick due to its amazing visuals, efficient storytelling, and — most importantly — its British humor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASCTLD"&gt;I got to chat with Poyzer about his journey of getting started in 3D, the development of &lt;em&gt;Floaters&lt;/em&gt;, and his tips for getting started in 3D art. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="auHHOv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tAx74"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take me to the beginning. How did you get started? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYELil"&gt;As a kid, I was hugely into sci-fi and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars. &lt;/em&gt;And as I was growing up, I was a little bit more of a polymath in terms of stuff that I did, like making music, how you play music, writing, and stuff like that. And then yeah, went to university and started film and then got into cinematography. And the thing for the next 10 years, it was just specializing in one creative outlet, which was a lot of fun. And it was really great, but that interest in sci-fi was always there and the storytelling element of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="M3OR1p"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.338%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/455703494?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FX5p0H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So tell me about your move into 3D. Did being a director of photography contribute to your exploration of this new medium? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9Og3V"&gt;I think what’s been interesting is I was quite scared, as I started spending more time on 3D, that I wouldn’t be taken as seriously. We have a problem in the UK with people hyphenating their job roles. I don’t think this is bad in the US, but we get quite snobby about life. When people do multiple things, they can’t be doing any of them seriously. So I was quite worried about how directors see me and that I would not be taken seriously as a cinematographer, whereas I found my following has increased tenfold really. And I’ve got a lot of new relationships with new directors through doing this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GZ0y8F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you leave the story out, you allow the people who are looking at the art to have some of that story.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5jele"&gt;I think the photography side of things gave me an advantage when it came to learning 3D because the lights work basically in the same way, but they are a lot cheaper. You don’t need to pay a crew overtime, and you’re not doing night shoots and all that. I think the thing that keeps me coming back to it, it’s just like that experimentation of those kinds of things and the storytelling of it. I’m not trying to be a full-time artist necessarily, so showing off art skills is something that I’m not bothered about. I’m more interested in whether a piece of art evokes some sort of story, whether it feels like there’s a story there or not. It was really nice when I first started putting stuff out when people were writing little bits of micro fiction and stuff like that. I’ve succeeded if it makes people feel like there’s room in there for them to put their own story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8XB95004BOLUDXgQUKk-5UEnA8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805155/karl_poyzer_screenshot_2021_05_18_at_18_32_30.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HjKiTV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Damn. That’s the dream. I can imagine that’s such a great feeling. People were just building out the world a little bit for you, and you’ve succeeded in giving them the bits that just spark something.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HN2LFY"&gt;Yeah. I think there were loads of great artists out there who do work, that you can see the story, that where there are people doing things. There are things moving in specific directions or things blowing up and exploding, and the story’s all there and it looks amazing. And then there are us who do less of that. And my feeling is like my favorite artists are the ones whose landscapes are almost devoid of people. My goal is to allow people to be the people in those pictures. So I think that if you leave the story out, you allow the people who are looking at the art to have some of that story.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j-bt4AY7mbk1_ww8Q8ueyu5YXPM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805156/karl_poyzer_asset_2.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6QBgaV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I wanted to ask a question about this. I read your &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/@liam3D/greeble-visual-technobabble-8d1cd99274bd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium post on greebles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; [bits of details on larger objects that make them appear more complex]. So I definitely want to ask a question where you could just rant about them! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qI5kyQ"&gt;Yeah, it’s exactly the same. I think people could maybe mistake my rant about greebles as a love of little things attached to spaceships, and it isn’t so much that. I think what I was trying to say was that putting things into your world, be them little bits of things sticking to the side of your spaceship to make it look more detailed or bits of story, I think they serve the same purpose. Is there a correlation between smoother spaceships and lesser stories? I don’t know, maybe. But I think in the ’70s and ’80s, you relied on that stuff a little bit more because you couldn’t just computer generate it. You couldn’t just show it, that things were a lot more difficult to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5C7m3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I tend to not go in with a plan.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ol8xZO"&gt;I think that limitation bred the need to expand your universe’s reach cheaply, and the cheapest way to do that normally was just have your character say something or allude to something that you don’t necessarily have to explore. Like the Kessel Run or the attack ships on fire from &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and stuff like that and the space jockey. There were all these nice little things, a lot of which have now sort of been explored and shown to us and they’re not ours anymore. It’s a shame really, nothing that they could have put on-screen would have been weirder than the sort of weird abstract thoughts that everyone had about what the space jockeys were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjanBR"&gt;I think it was such a beautiful thing that we got to have a little bit of ownership of, we were trusted with. It’s a shame that there isn’t more of that. I miss the strangeness, the lack of logic. And I think it’s why when people ask me what things do in my pieces, my answer is always, “That’s yours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Exe0M2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pjvxqlyEPkzEXwTCvFpwauV1O3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805163/karl_poyzer_asset_4.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f62MjE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when you make a piece, what’s the guiding light as you assemble things?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YmAMy"&gt;I would say like 80 percent of what I make, I go in without a plan. I think the work I’m happiest with is work where I’ve gone in without a plan because it’s normally the strangest. It’s not always the case. Sometimes, especially if I’m working on &lt;em&gt;Floaters&lt;/em&gt;, I’ll have to make a thing that’s a specific thing to do a specific thing. But yeah, with the art, the surrealism of it, I think I tend to not go in with a plan. And then at that point, it’s just about finding shapes of things that I think, “Oh, that’s interesting.” You can get carried away quite easily in 3D because you can just keep adding and adding and adding. And then all of a sudden, your thing doesn’t look good anymore. And then you’ve got to scale it back and it’s weird, like how wide do you go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Py1X6g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was kind of a case of trying to work out how those limitations would become positives rather than negatives.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryC18Y"&gt;And that can sometimes be a battle. It’s a weird thing because I feel like a lot of the time, there’s probably only about an hour and a half’s worth of like if I was to remake, it would maybe only take me an hour. But sometimes it’s like four or five hours of just me looking at a thing. It started as a spaceship, then it became a building, and then it was a spaceship again. That process is a lot of fun. I use references and, obviously, I look at a lot of stuff on Pinterest and try and take as much. In the same way, we were talking about kitbashing and greebling. It’s the same thing. It’s like picking a little bit of that and a little bit of that and mashing them together and seeing what comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60R6EwXnIyJb3mQPVof6LoGbHIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805161/karl_poyzer_asset_3.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MrE8tg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe the relationship you have with your art?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQDgEQ"&gt;That’s a good question. Would I describe it as an abusive relationship? Maybe I would. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2f1i1P"&gt;I get super excited when I’m making something. And it’s got to a point where I’m happy with them, “Oh, there it is. Let’s go down this road.” And I’m super excited to put it out and the dopamine hit of people liking it and sharing it. I’m very, very lucky to have my work shared quite a lot. I think being starved of that for 10 years in the film industry, I need that feedback. So the last couple of years in the film industry was just being slower and slower as the budgets got bigger. And it was just was longer and longer period of time between projects. I think it’s become a joyous thing to just be able to make it and put it out and be excited about it. But I do look back at them after a couple of days and then don’t like looking at them anymore. So I have a fling with each of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WxPinZIHnyXry5z5dC834fEL27I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805209/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.01.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqgi3P"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floaters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; come about? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7iWXE"&gt;It was a weird one. Although I’d been doing 3D for a little while, it was the first time I’d ever animated anything. So it was born out of restrictions really in that I knew that I wasn’t going to be able to animate people or do rigging or any of that stuff. So all we really had was the option to make things float and move up and down. So it was kind of a case of trying to work out how those limitations would become positives rather than negatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HIznDN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You have to find the way that you want to do it.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ns1GUr"&gt;We stumbled upon this nice little idea where we just never see the inside of a spaceship and always just do everything from exteriors. That kind of became a selling point rather than a limitation. The design language is just a lot of fun. I think a lot of sci-fi can get quite serious, which I love, but it’s kind of nice to just undercut it with really dry British humor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ySryw"&gt;It turned out to be, I think by a country mile, the most popular thing either of us had ever done. And it was just sort of taking it not really seriously. I think it was an interesting exercise and just doing a thing that you feel like you could do well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPa7gT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you say for people starting out their journey in art and 3D? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPCy1"&gt;The hardest part of doing any of this stuff when you’re starting out is going back to it the next day. And you won’t go back the next day if you didn’t enjoy the day before. When you’re first starting to learn something, to get to a point where you enjoy it is really difficult, I had to start in a way that allowed me to sort of come back the next day. And I think that to do that, you have to find the way that you want to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdLsPD"&gt;To begin with, you’re going to cut corners and you’re going to do it wrong. You are going to do it differently. I always say this about Blender and having a small sort of Patreon of people who have Blender questions and making tutorials. I think a lot of tutorials are designed for people or made by people who went to university and learned how to do 3D properly from the very basics. Whereas like my approach was I came in sideways and I was like, “Look, this thing works if you do this, I don’t necessarily know why. I don’t know what its purpose is, but it works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XsUO0b"&gt;It might take you a little bit longer, but you’re never going to learn the proper way if you’re not doing it in a year’s time, two years’ time. And that’s the real shame is that people give up. If there’s a way you’re making something you’re happy with and you’re going back to it the next day, you’ll learn all of the other stuff. If you’re enjoying it, you’re going back to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbbIxx"&gt;	&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoPCx3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gHMF6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJavqa"&gt;WhatsApp has added the ability for users to migrate their chat history when switching from iOS to Samsung Android devices, the company said in a blog post. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; the feature was coming during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617405/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-biggest-announcements-z-flip-z-fold-3-watch-buds-note"&gt;August Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt;, and addresses one of the more frustrating features — or lack of— of WhatsApp on mobile devices. Previously, if users selected WhatsApp’s cloud backup feature, then iOS chat histories were stored in iCloud, while Android’s histories backed up to Google Drive, making it almost impossible to transfer chats between phones that weren’t running the same operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PdA5ieES-HJwx6ys2wl3zsTImLk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22775559/Cross_Platform_Switch_UI__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0DrVEe"&gt;There are a few caveats WhatsApp outlines in its blog post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="FCwuEr"&gt;If you’re moving from an iPhone to a Samsung Android device, you can transfer your account information, profile photo, individual chats, group chats, chat history, media and settings. You can’t transfer your call history or display name&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hHXRhx"&gt;In addition, you can only do the migration during initial setup of your new Samsung device, as the instructions from WhatsApp say that “your new Android device must be factory new or reset to factory settings” to allow the migration, so users would have to do a complete factory reset of their Samsung device if it is already operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OjsaE"&gt;The old iPhone needs to have WhatsApp iOS version 2.21.160.17 or newer and the new Samsung phone has to have WhatsApp Android version 2.21.16.20 or newer. The new device needs to have the Samsung SmartSwitch app version 3.7.22.1 or newer installed. The transfer takes place via a USB-C to Lightning cable, so you’ll need one of those as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYwrkO"&gt;Here are the steps to conduct the transfer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="g6OV8z"&gt;How to migrate WhatsApp chats from an iPhone to a new Samsung device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="0ASdU2"&gt;Turn on your Samsung and connect by cable to your iPhone when prompted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c79xLj"&gt;Follow the Samsung Smart Switch instructions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OKC1rK"&gt;When prompted, scan the QR code displayed on the new Samsung device using the iPhone’s camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6jrAH1"&gt;Tap Start on your iPhone, and wait for the process to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uzUnLN"&gt;Continue setting up your new Samsung device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wsVryK"&gt;When you reach the home screen, open WhatsApp and log in using the same phone number used on your old device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Izn4eU"&gt;Tap Import when prompted, and allow the process to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3s2QN2"&gt;Finish activating your new device. Your WhatsApp chats should now be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="WBQNcl"&gt;After you complete the migration, your old iPhone will still have your data on it unless you delete WhatsApp or wipe the device completely. The transferred data doesn’t go to cloud storage after the migration, and WhatsApp says it can’t see the data you transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7HiHS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1ZlNz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Floods, fires, and extreme heat: disaster pile-ups are the new norm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The forecast for the future is a deluge of disasters&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="dca39N"&gt;Extreme heat, fires, flash floods, intense rain, hurricane-force winds, and tornadoes left people reeling from coast to coast across the US this week. Each event on its own is dangerous. Striking all at once or in quick succession, the sum of the disasters grows monstrous, overwhelming communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UB6YUJ"&gt;“What we’re learning is that the unthinkable may have always been more likely than we wanted to admit — and with climate change, it becomes much more likely,” says Radley Horton, a research professor at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory who studies climate extremes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="A65vgX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The unthinkable may have always been more likely than we wanted to admit — and with climate change, it becomes much more likely.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cocaGi"&gt;A pile-up of catastrophes is called a “compound event,” and it’s something that’s testing humanity’s limits as climate change supercharges extreme weather around the globe. Existing infrastructure wasn’t built for this kind of punishment, and even the most experienced first responders are faced with scenarios no one has ever seen before. Before they can even catch their breath from one crisis, it seems, communities are dealt another blow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJw30"&gt;Hurricane Ida is already a case study in compound events. The storm’s floodwaters drowned neighborhoods along the Gulf Coast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647037/hurricane-ida-rapid-intensification-louisiana-storm"&gt;early in the week&lt;/a&gt;. Ida’s 150 mph winds toppled power lines and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22650382/new-orleans-lousiana-gas-plant-entergy-power-outage-hurricane-ida-electricity-grid"&gt;wreaked havoc on the electricity grid&lt;/a&gt;. As if that wasn’t enough, &lt;a href="https://www.wwno.org/news/2021-08-31/heat-advisories-issued-across-gulf-coast-with-power-water-still-out-after-hurricane-ida"&gt;dangerous levels of heat and humidity&lt;/a&gt; settled in once the storm passed, leaving many residents in Louisiana and Mississippi sweating it out in wrecked neighborhoods without power or air conditioning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgztlZ"&gt;“This is a type of event, definitely we can expect to happen more often,”  says Jakob Zscheischler, an Earth system scientist at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, Germany. “Even if the number of hurricanes don’t change in the future, the likelihood that they are followed by extreme heat is much higher because global temperature is rising.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i7HYWB"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New York's infrastructure is completely unprepared for climate change &lt;a href="https://t.co/EZybrGdzDa"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EZybrGdzDa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Lucky Tran (@luckytran) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/luckytran/status/1433260326636621827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3VE25M"&gt;Ida barreled northward after striking the South, pummeling states that had just received record levels of rain the week before. As more rain poured into a sodden Tennessee, organizers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Bonnaroo/status/1432805468272005130"&gt;cancelled the Bonnaroo music festival&lt;/a&gt;, citing a ‘tremendous amount of rain’ that left campgrounds flooded. People are still living under tarps after massive flooding in the state last week. Further north, streets became rivers in New York City, which recorded its rainiest hour on record. That record had been set less than two weeks before when &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/23/nyregion/nyc-rain-storm-flooding-weather.html"&gt;Hurricane Henri hit&lt;/a&gt; the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04GLAj"&gt;Meanwhile, the western part of the country is coping with a one-two punch of drought and heat, which also sets the stage for massive infernos. Residents are being asked to curb their water use while enduring summer heatwaves. They might not have air conditioning at times because of preemptive blackouts aimed at preventing power lines from sparking a blaze. Then, when wildfires do explode, it saddles them with yet another growing &lt;a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2021/08/23/wildfire-smoke-early-births/#:~:text=The%20findings%20underscore%20the%20value,should%20avoid%20very%20smoky%20air.&amp;amp;text=Exposure%20to%20wildfire%20smoke%20during,new%20Stanford%20University%20study%20suggests."&gt;public health disaster&lt;/a&gt;: air laden with soot and pollution and from wildfire smoke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NEYSY3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;None of these events are random strokes of bad luck&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hXZrmM"&gt;From the storms in the East to the fires in the West, none of these events are random strokes of bad luck. They are tied together by the worsening climate crisis. Human activity — namely the burning of fossil fuels — is the main driver behind an uptick in extreme weather, a&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt; major United Nations climate report said definitively&lt;/a&gt; last month. Greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels trap heat; that heat drives up summer temperatures and gives storms more energy. Climate change has also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt; souped up the water cycle&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to more droughts &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more downpours. Compound events are likely to become more common, the report predicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzB9Gg"&gt;“They are called extreme events because they’re a big deviation from the norm, but they are becoming the norm,” says Michael Oppenheimer, director of the Center for Policy Research on Energy and Environment at Princeton University. “We have to deal with the fallout of a new event before we’re finished dealing with the fallout of the previous event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuOIUS"&gt;Communities will have to adapt to that new reality by looking at the big picture rather than focusing on each extreme event individually — drought &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;fire, storm &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;heat, rain &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;more rain. Small communities &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/climate/climate-towns-bankruptcy.html"&gt;are going bankrupt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reports, after being pushed to the edge by storms and conflagrations. Other small towns, like Paradise and Greenville in California, have nearly been scorched off the map completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4Qkrg"&gt;But how can society prepare for these compound events — worst-case scenarios that might be beyond our current realm of experience? “That’s the million dollar question that I think we’re late to the game in asking,” Horton says. “You need to have rainy day funds, whether it’s literally, financially speaking, or whether it’s investing in more resilient infrastructure, more emergency service people, and not waiting until a crisis happens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="e0aS1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The million dollar question”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J20utP"&gt;That might mean changes to how we respond to disasters. In the past, federal agencies like FEMA might have been able to focus their resources on the aftermath of a single superstorm during a hurricane season. As climate change makes storms stronger, it stretches those resources thin. We saw this in 2017 when Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico weeks after Hurricanes Harvey and Irma devastated the mainland (Irma also struck Puerto Rico), and &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/how-the-response-to-hurricane-maria-compared-to-harvey-and-irma/"&gt;FEMA sent&lt;/a&gt; haggard workers and inexperienced trainees to cope with the fallout from Maria on the island territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfyW2m"&gt;Even beyond responding to and recovering from disaster, compound events also change risk assessments for everyday decisions like where to build new homes and buildings. “We should never, ever build in a city or expand without the system being built in a way that recognizes and is able to deal with the anticipated effects of climate change,” Oppenheimer says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PVQJQV"&gt;Another part of developing new risk assessments involves figuring out who is most at risk. Black Americans, in particular, will likely face more severe effects of climate change compared to all other demographic groups, according to &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-report-shows-disproportionate-impacts-climate-change-socially-vulnerable"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; published by the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday. They often live in neighborhoods that can climb several degrees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575481/nyc-urban-heat-island-effect-thermal-camera-surface-temperature"&gt;hotter than other areas&lt;/a&gt; because of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452777/hot-summer-weather-race-urban-heat-island-us-cities"&gt;history of segregation and disinvestment&lt;/a&gt;, previous research has found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRTyOj"&gt;“The impacts of climate change that we are feeling today, from extreme heat to flooding to severe storms, are expected to get worse, and people least able to prepare and cope are disproportionately exposed,” EPA administrator Michael Regan said in a press release.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik4uiA"&gt;We’ll ultimately need compound solutions to all these compound risks, experts say. That includes bigger rainy day funds and beefed-up emergency response teams. Cities and infrastructure will need to be built differently, and we might have to abandon some places we used to call home. Humans will have to stop pumping out greenhouse gases that are driving the climate crisis in the first place, Oppenheimer emphasizes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="r6ZVhW"&gt;President Joe Biden addressed the nation this past week with an appeal to Congress to pass legislation that will overhaul US infrastructure in light of the week’s brutal climate disasters. “The past few days of Hurricane Ida and the wildfires in the West and the unprecedented flash floods in New York In New Jersey is yet another reminder. These extreme storms, and the climate crisis are here,” he said in a press conference. “We need to be better prepared. We need to act.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefly’s Alpha rocket detonated by Space Force during first launch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ojxkzIa1JGA1z7W5UyWb2yyDNt8=/129x0:1503x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813537/Screen_Shot_2021_09_03_at_9.51.15_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7IFlRE"&gt;Small launch company Firefly’s Alpha rocket exploded mid-flight Thursday night, minutes after a clean liftoff during its first attempt to reach space. The rocket was terminated, Space Force officials said, as it began tipping sideways off course just after reaching supersonic speeds. Firefly said it’s working with regulators to investigate the cause of the failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaE4I3"&gt;Alpha, a two-stage rocket standing ten stories tall, lifted off from the Vandenberg Space Force base in California at 9:59PM ET on Thursday, aiming to send a payload of tiny private satellites to space at no charge to the owners. The launch was risky — it was Firefly’s first ever mission, so a failure wasn’t a big surprise. Two and a half minutes after liftoff, the rocket fell short of reaching its maximum aerodynamic pressure and began swinging to the side, tipping horizontally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7aoe4e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we will be diligent in our investigation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3E2Cl"&gt;At that point the rocket exploded, a dramatic result of &lt;a href="https://www.vandenberg.spaceforce.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/2763829/firefly-alpha-terminated-mid-flight/"&gt;Space Launch Delta 30&lt;/a&gt; stepping in to terminate the launch vehicle to prevent it from becoming a hazard to the public. In a statement, Firefly said it was too early to know what caused the mishap, and that “we will be diligent in our investigation” with the Space Force and the Federal Aviation Administration. “We are happy to report that there were no injuries associated with the anomaly,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MdmRtB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

Stay tuned to the NSF youtube channel for the full video. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASASpaceflight?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASASpaceflight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ck4fB98Xbc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ck4fB98Xbc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jack Beyer (@thejackbeyer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thejackbeyer/status/1433618654889865216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K6HHXb"&gt;Firefly said it achieved a number of key mission objectives despite the explosion, including a successful first stage ignition, clean liftoff from the pad, and “progression to supersonic speed.” All those points, it said, generated test flight data that will help the company move forward with the rocket’s testing and development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9SYR8"&gt;Under development for roughly a decade, Alpha is the company’s centerpiece rocket designed to launch tiny satellites to space, serving as one of a handful of small launchers across the industry that are in their infancy, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;Astra’s “Rocket 3”&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21300782/relativity-space-launch-site-air-force-base-terran-1-rocket-3d-printing"&gt;Relativity’s Terran 1&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha, a bit bigger than its rival rockets, is powered by four of the company’s Reaver engines and designed to send 2,200 pounds of payload to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSLUir"&gt;Firefly aims to sell a dedicated launch on Alpha for $15 million. Once operational, it’ll be able to loft heavier payloads to space than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306971/rocket-lab-neutron-public-spac"&gt;Rocket Lab’s&lt;/a&gt; Electron rocket, which is well into its operational life, or Virgin Orbit’s air-launched LauncherOne rocket, which just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557103/watch-virgin-orbit-launch-debut-commercial-mission-richard-branson"&gt;shot its first commercial payload to space in June&lt;/a&gt;. All these rockets are tailored to sate growing demand for launch services from the small satellite industry.&lt;/p&gt;
