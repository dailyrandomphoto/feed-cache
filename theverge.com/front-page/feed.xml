    <title>How to watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_4LmTv57zrl1SWlsduNNJAWQ3do=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/51620637/placeholder_v1-05_720.170.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JKEk79"&gt;If you’re a Samsung fan — or just curious about what the manufacturer means when it announces that “the most powerful Galaxy is coming” — then you may want to drop in on today’s Galaxy Unpacked event 10AM ET / 7AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9DezX"&gt;There isn’t a lot of info out there about what’s in store. But those who have been following Samsung can made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382512/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-april-28th-event-most-powerful-device-book-pro"&gt;a few educated guesses&lt;/a&gt;. These include the possibility of a new line of Galaxy Book laptops — a line that is certainly due for a refresh, since the last models were first announced in 2019. Other rumors include new Galaxy Book Pro laptops with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch OLED panels, and S-Pen support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Dnz5s"&gt;Want to be the first to find out for sure? We’ll stream it above, so feel free to stick around, but there are other ways to watch it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIVuhB"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE “SAMSUNG UNPACKED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM ET / 7AM PT today, Wednesday, April 28th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE SAMSUNG EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;You can watch it at the top of this article; in addition, Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt; and it’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/81vXN2MOi0s"&gt;streaming on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify premium subscriber count increases 21 percent to 158 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNG6o8OSqmmBmnydStQKewVpj6w=/208x0:1162x636/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197577/image__7_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s subscriber growth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zksf6g"&gt;Spotify now boasts 158 million premium subscribers and 356 million monthly active users, according to its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt; released today. That’s a 21 percent and 24 percent year-over-year increase, respectively. It’s up from 155 million premium subscribers and 345 million monthly active users last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ittJB7"&gt;The streaming service has continued to focus on podcasts both as a way to convert free listeners to premium subscribers, and as a way to generate ad revenue. Spotify said that ad-supported revenue outperformed its forecast thanks in part to its podcasting efforts. In particular, the company said the Joe Rogan Experience, which it now exclusively licenses, “performed above expectations.” Spotify says it’s seen a “strong increase” in the amount of hours of podcast listening on the platform, though the actual proportion of users listening to podcasts was “consistent” with the previous quarter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCjvAJ"&gt;Just yesterday Spotify announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;launch of podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s only rolling them out for select partners at the moment and has said podcasters won’t have to pay it for the service for the first two years, meaning we’re unlikely to see it generating any extra revenue for Spotify until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKavasvO_RvpN1Ai36dBUUF0XAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475049/Spotify_Q1_2021_Earnings_Infographic_Motion_20210428.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hrQccw"&gt;It’s a similar story with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads"&gt;Car Thing music player&lt;/a&gt; which is only getting a limited launch for now, and which the company is currently giving away rather than selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQqQuB"&gt;Today’s release follows Spotify’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;soon be increasing prices&lt;/a&gt; for its family plan in the US and Duo, Student, and Family plans in the UK and some European countries. Today’s numbers give a possible reason for the increases: Spotify’s falling average revenue per subscriber. Spotify says it earned an average of €4.12 (around $4.97) per premium subscriber. That’s a decrease of 7 percent compared to the same period the previous year. Within Spotify’s premium business, average revenue per user has declined for five out of the six previous quarters due to Spotify using discounted plans to attract subscribers in new markets like Russia and India, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mna6li"&gt;Spotify consistently cites “product mix” as the reason for this decline, suggesting that more of its users are opting for cheaper subscription bundles. Increasing the price of these bundles could help slow the trend. Today’s earnings release only covers the period up until the end of March, so we won’t see any impact of this week’s price increases until next quarter, if that. But Spotify reports that the increases have shown no “material impacts” on cancellation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUKBhy"&gt;Amidst these price increases, Spotify is also attempting to push back against criticism that it doesn’t pay artists enough to stream their music. Last month it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336087/spotify-loud-clear-website-launch-pay-artists-streaming-royalities"&gt;launched a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear where it attempted to offer more transparency about its payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WkfcE"&gt;Overall, Spotify made a profit of €23 million, up from €1 million a year before, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Ym6N"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change to Spotify’s core music streaming business is due to arrive later this year when it launches its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;HiFi lossless streaming tier&lt;/a&gt;. The service promises it “will deliver music in CD-quality, lossless audio format to your device and Spotify Connect-enabled speakers” in the “select markets” where it’s launching. Pricing for the new subscription tier is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fined $12M by Russian regulator over App Store monopoly abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3RndH-wUt0Ddj6SWahiycWcotio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197569/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="de1B1g"&gt;Russia’s antitrust regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), has fined Apple $12 million over complaints it unfairly cracked down on third-party parental control apps, the &lt;a href="https://fas.gov.ru/news/31268"&gt;regulator has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The FAS started its investigation after &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaspersky.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-fas-complaint%2F26017%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407293%2Fapple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;receiving a complaint from Kaspersky Lab&lt;/a&gt; in March 2019, which claimed Apple had forced it to limit the functionality of its Safe Kids app shortly after Apple added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;Screen Time feature to iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpfBwL"&gt;The fine comes in the same week that EU regulators are expected to issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405260/apple-eu-antitrust-charges-app-store-policies-decision-rumor"&gt;charges of their own&lt;/a&gt; against Apple. These come in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in March 2019 about the 30 percent cut Apple takes for in-app purchases, which it said gives Apple’s own services an unfair advantage. As well as Spotify, parental control apps Kidslox and Qustodio also complained to European regulators, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i5TwsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple plans to appeal the fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WWonOa"&gt;In its statement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-competition-watchdog-fines-apple-12-mln-abusing-dominant-position-2021-04-27/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the FAS said it wants Apple to take steps to ensure its own apps don’t have an unfair advantage, and that developers of parental control apps can distribute their software without having to limit its functionality. The FAS originally determined Apple had abused its market position &lt;a href="https://fas.gov.ru/news/30275"&gt;in August last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIuhM3"&gt;In response to the fine, Apple said it disagrees with the regulator’s decision and that it will be issuing an appeal. “We worked with Kaspersky to get their app in compliance with rules that were put in place to protect children,” an Apple spokesperson said. “They now have 13 apps on the App Store and we have processed hundreds of updates for them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNB3d3"&gt;Kaspersky Lab declined to comment on news of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTJmBH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;originally justified&lt;/a&gt; limiting the functionality of third-party parental control apps because it said they were using Mobile Device Management (MDM) technology, which is intended for enterprises to control company devices. Apple said it was “incredibly risky” for consumer-focused apps to have the same level of control, and that it could make them vulnerable to hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr9KMy"&gt;However, after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18646601/parental-control-app-developers-band-together-to-demand-an-api-from-apple"&gt;outcry from developers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple later changed its policies to allow the use of MDM technology for parental control apps, but only “in limited cases.” At the time, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaspersky.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-fas-complaint%2F26017%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3Dupdate%3A%2520june%252010%2C%25202019.%2520regarding%2520recent%2520changes%2520to%2520the%2520apple%2520app%2520store%2520review%2520guidelines&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407293%2Fapple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kaspersky welcomed the changes&lt;/a&gt; but expressed concern that using the technology would require Apple’s written consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw7517"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5PA2l"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony has sold 7.8 million PS5 consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LRVLXm50FBz28Cq1mLjyqFjmA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197315/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LZjurN"&gt;Sony has sold 7.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles as of March 31st, the company says in its latest earnings report. The number of PlayStation Plus subscribers is now 47.6 million, a 14.7 percent increase year on year. The fourth-quarter figures bring the overall PlayStation business to a total operating profit of 342.2 billion yen ($3.14 billion) for the 2020 financial year — a record for Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJPihh"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263821/sony-earnings-q3-2020-ps5-launch-sales"&gt;last earnings report&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the company had shipped 4.5 million PS5 units worldwide through the end of 2020. That means that 3.3 million units were shipped from January to March, giving an idea of Sony’s current manufacturing capacity; it’s still very difficult to actually buy a PS5, with demand far outstripping supply. The quarter-to-quarter drop is likely explained by Sony ramping up production ahead of the system’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPdFSG"&gt;Earlier this month NPD &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1383042564756893703"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the PS5 was the fastest selling console in US history through its first five months of availability, both in terms of units moved and total dollar spend. For the first quarter of 2021, however, Nintendo has sold more Switch units in the US than Sony has of the PS5, according to NPD. That’s not really surprising given how hard it’s been to find a PS5 since the initial launch batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q1PZb"&gt;Sony also shipped an additional million PS4 consoles in the last quarter, bringing that system’s life-to-date number to 115.9 million units. The figure is down 28.6 percent from the previous year’s 1.4 million. Sony’s report suggests PS5 is selling a little faster than the PS4 worldwide — the PS4 had shipped 7.6 million units as of March 31st, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Behind the controversy at Basecamp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ZdNX4hAbMiFb_Z2d6hYMJ-HRU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69196232/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Basecamp announced it would ban “societal and political discussions” at work. But the hardest conversations at work were about the company itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="ixNrS1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jGKU9Y"&gt;The controversy that embroiled enterprise software maker Basecamp this week began more than a decade ago, with a simple list of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khUDr4"&gt;Around 2009, Basecamp customer service representatives began keeping a list of names that they found funny. More than a decade later, current employees were so mortified by the practice that none of them would give me a single example of a name on the list. One invoked the sorts of names Bart Simpson used to use when prank calling Moe the Bartender: Amanda Hugginkiss, Seymour Butz, Mike Rotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1wSMY"&gt;Many of the names were of American or European origin. But others were Asian, or African, and eventually the list — titled “Best Names Ever” — began to make people uncomfortable. What once had felt like an innocent way to blow off steam, amid the ongoing cultural reckoning over speech and corporate responsibility, increasingly looked inappropriate, and often racist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="viuSW6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Several employees, though, are already making their exit plans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4n8CbZ"&gt;Discussion about the list and how the company ought to hold itself accountable for creating it led directly to CEO Jason Fried announcing Tuesday that &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;Basecamp would ban employees from holding “societal and political discussions”&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s internal chat forums. The move, which has sparked widespread discussion in Silicon Valley, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/30/21493906/brian-armstrong-coinbase-blog-post-politics-workplace-activism"&gt;follows a similar move from cryptocurrency company Coinbase last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H0vaI"&gt;Fried’s memo was revised and updated several times; co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson followed with &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69"&gt;one of his own&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they are two of the most outspoken leaders in the entire tech industry on issues related to company culture, remote work, and collaboration. The company has &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/books"&gt;published five books&lt;/a&gt; on work culture, one of which was a &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTIsay"&gt;But both of their posts avoided discussing the actual series of events that had led up to the policies, which were related directly to the workplace. In fact, the events all took place on Basecamp’s own software, which it sells to other companies on the promise of improving cohesion and reducing stress in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ub6Svk"&gt;Employees say the founders’ memos unfairly depicted their workplace as being riven by partisan politics, when in fact the main source of the discussion had always been Basecamp itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrA4Gc"&gt;“At least in my experience, it has always been centered on what is happening at Basecamp,” said one employee — who, like most of those I spoke with today, requested anonymity so as to freely discuss internal deliberations. “What is being done at Basecamp? What is being said at Basecamp? And how it is affecting individuals? It has never been big political discussions, like ‘the postal service should be disbanded,’ or ‘I don’t like Amy Klobuchar.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZZ3E1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A lot of people are gonna have a tough time living with that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifr1iY"&gt;Interviews with a half-dozen Basecamp employees over the past day paint a portrait of a company where workers sought to advance Basecamp’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by having sensitive discussions about the company’s own failures. After months of fraught conversations, Fried and his co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson moved to shut those conversations down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDoIh5"&gt;”In the end, we feel like this is the long-term healthy way forward for Basecamp as a whole — the company and our products,” Fried wrote in his blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6s7me"&gt;Several employees, though, are already making their exit plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBLjep"&gt;Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration tools and launched the email service Hey last year, has long been recognized for producing “opinionated software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQzmxk"&gt;“We’ve hired opinionated people, we’ve created opinionated software, and now basically the company has said, ‘well, your opinions don’t really matter — unless it’s directly related to business,’” one told me. “A lot of people are gonna have a tough time living with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lZYH1U"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GbG39u"&gt;In December, a new hire at Basecamp volunteered to help the company work on diversity issues. Posting on a long-dormant thread in the &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/how-it-works"&gt;Basecamp software&lt;/a&gt;, which resembles a message board, the employee sought other volunteers to begin working on DE&amp;amp;I issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoXGFl"&gt;There was reason to believe that the co-founders would be receptive. In 2017, after Basecamp had been around for 18 years, Fried &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201709/jason-fried/2017-inc5000-diversity-in-the-workforce.html"&gt;wrote an essay in &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; about the company’s weak record on diversity issues&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe a company is at its best when it reflects those it serves,” Fried wrote. “If you fill a room with 20 random employees and 20 random customers, an outside observer should have trouble telling them apart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccprmq"&gt;Last year, in the wake of the racial justice protest that swept the country, Hansson had encouraged employees to read &lt;em&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/em&gt;, a memoir by Ta-Nehisi Coates, and &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, Michelle Alexander’s exploration of the racist nature of mass incarceration. Both founders are also active — and occasionally hyperactive — on Twitter, where they regularly advocate for mainstream liberal and progressive views on social issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5c0NP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“just a gross violation of the trust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sv1ymL"&gt;While Basecamp does not publish diversity statistics, it is still, like most tech companies, majority white and male, employees said. But the idea of worker-led efforts on diversity issues got a frosty reception from the founders last year, employees told me. They were allowed to work on the project, but did not feel as if the founders were particularly invested in the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yezk2A"&gt;Nonetheless, the DE&amp;amp;I council attracted significant support. More than a third of the company — 20 out of roughly 58 employees — volunteered to help. They began examining Basecamp’s hiring processes, which vendors the company works with, how Basecamp employees socialize, and what speakers they might invite to one of the all-remote company’s twice-yearly in-person gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvBT0r"&gt;In the aftermath of these discussions, employees began to discuss the list of customer names. On April 13, two employees posted an apology on the internal Basecamp for having contributed to the list in the past. The employee responsible for initially creating it had left the company. But while previous versions of the list had been deleted, copies had resurfaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyWg1K"&gt;The employees noted that there had never been an internal reckoning over the list, and said it was important to discuss why making fun of customers’ names had been wrong. The apology included an image of “&lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/pyramid-of-hate.pdf"&gt;the pyramid of hate&lt;/a&gt;,” an illustration created by the Anti-Defamation League to show how the most extreme acts of extremist violence are enabled by a foundation of biased attitudes and acts of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBtytT"&gt;A day later, Hansson responded with a post of his own. He had conducted a forensic analysis of who created the document and how it had spread around the company. He called it a systemic failure on the company’s part. In a conversation with me today, he acknowledged that he and Fried had known about the list for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axsiOC"&gt;“There was some awareness at the time within the company that that list had existed and it wasn’t acted upon. That is squarely on Jason’s and my record.” The list, he said, “in itself is just a gross violation of the trust … It’s just wrong in all sorts of fundamental ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJCPFi"&gt;Employees responded mostly positively to the first part of this note. But Hansson went further, taking exception to the use of the pyramid of hate in a workplace discussion. He told me today that attempting to link the list of customer names to potential genocide represented a case of “catastrophizing” — one that made it impossible for any good-faith discussions to follow. Presumably, any employees who are found contributing to genocidal attitudes should be fired on the spot — and yet nobody involved seemed to think that contributing to or viewing the list was a fireable offense. If that’s the case, Hansson said, then the pyramid of hate had no place in the discussion. To him, it escalated employees’ emotions past the point of being productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rCfPWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for a small company, Basecamp has taken an outsized number of political stances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQMNnB"&gt;Hansson wanted to acknowledge the situation as a failure and move on. But when employees who had been involved in the list wanted to continue talking about it, he grew exasperated. “You are the person you are complaining about,” he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkKi0H"&gt;Employees took a different view. In a response to Hansson’s post, one employee noted that the way we treat names — especially foreign names — is deeply connected to social and racial hierarchies. Just a few weeks earlier, eight people had been killed in a shooting spree in Atlanta. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent, and their names had sometimes been mangled in press reports. (The Asian American Journalists Association responded by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAmAmnaNawaz/status/1373016964038324228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373016964038324228%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailykos.com%2Fstory%2F2021%2F3%2F27%2F2022680%2F-Say-their-names"&gt;issuing a pronunciation guide&lt;/a&gt;.) The point was that dehumanizing behavior begins with very small actions, and it did not seem like too much to ask Basecamp’s founders to acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZUt0P"&gt;Hansson’s response to this employee took aback many of the workers I spoke with. He dug through old chat logs to find a time when the employee in question participated in a discussion about a customer with a funny-sounding name. Hansson posted the message — visible to the entire company — and dismissed the substance of the employee’s complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVrKj5"&gt;Two other employees were sufficiently concerned by the public dressing-down of a colleague that they filed complaints with Basecamp’s human resources officer. (HR declined to take action against the company co-founder.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Itlw0K"&gt;Less than two weeks later, Fried announced the new company policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E9yh0G"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UynkQ9"&gt;When Coinbase announced its ban on internal political discussions last year, some managers I spoke with praised the move for the clarity it brought to the workplace. By making workplace chat a politics-free zone, Coinbase was freeing employees to do the work they were hired to, rather than wage partisan warfare on the job. It’s no surprise, then, that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was among those who praised Basecamp’s moves this week: “Another mission focused company,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1386806511628783617?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the emoji for applause. “It takes courage in these times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGpxdL"&gt;What that view misses, I think, is how confusing rules like these are to employees. One Basecamp worker I spoke with today, who requested anonymity, wondered the extent to which parenting issues could be raised at work. “How do you talk about raising kids without talking about society?” the employee said. “As soon as I bring up public schools, then it’s already political.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpvBic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the move was received more as a shift to willful ignorance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrD1L2"&gt;Jane Yang, a data analyst at the company, told me that restricting internal conversations would negatively affect diversity and inclusion efforts. For example, she said, the company’s profit-sharing plan gave more profits to people who have longer tenure — a group that is majority white and male. Making that discussion off-limits internally could ensure that inequality in profit sharing becomes a structural feature of the company. (Yang also &lt;a href="https://janeyang.org/2021/04/27/an-open-letter-to-jason-and-david/"&gt;wrote an open letter to the founders about her experiences at the company&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJx8aL"&gt;That confusion is compounded by the fact that, for a small company, Basecamp has taken an outsized number of political stances — all of which employees are encouraged to discuss. Most prominently, the company and its founders have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;vocal critics of Apple’s 30 percent tax on in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also involved itself in politics at a much lower level: in 2018 Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/inno/stories/news/2018/04/30/why-tech-founder-neal-s-les-griffin-is-running-for.html"&gt;let a candidate for Chicago mayor use its office in the West Loop as a campaign headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49RNqb"&gt;Basecamp employees are encouraged to discuss the company’s own political positions — or, perhaps more accurately, the founders’ political positions — as much as they like. Keeping track of which issues of the moment are up for discussion thus becomes one more chunk of mental overhead for employees who are already struggling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWG7bE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they are not interested in seeing things in their work timeline that make them uncomfortable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCq1GW"&gt;Hansson told me that the rules are not draconian — no one is going to be bounced out the door for occasionally straying out of bounds. The founders’ goal is to reset the culture and focus on making products, he said, not to purge political partisans from the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJRlFn"&gt;But to employees, the move was received more as a shift to willful ignorance — about the world around them, and about the lived experiences of the employees who occupied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nBg0km"&gt;“There’s always been this kind of unwritten rule at Basecamp that the company basically exists for David and Jason’s enjoyment,” one employee told me. “At the end of the day, they are not interested in seeing things in their work timeline that make them uncomfortable, or distracts them from what they’re interested in. And this is the culmination of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rHtSVm"&gt;
&lt;p id="q9qLVV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUUrTa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPlXM4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation Network was down globally for over an hour</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="alN1yQ"&gt;If you were having issues with the PlayStation Network (PSN) this evening or afternoon, you weren’t alone. The service suffered an outage, with multiplayer, store services, and more going down for around an hour. The outage appeared to be global — the official Ask PlayStation Japan Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskPS_JP/status/1387165181709627394"&gt;reported the issue&lt;/a&gt;, and we saw many users from Europe also reporting problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evjd8R"&gt;It seems like it’s resolved now, with the &lt;a href="https://status.playstation.com/"&gt;PSN status page&lt;/a&gt; showing that everything is up and running. I’ve also confirmed that I’ve been able to download a game from the PlayStation Store, and hop into a multiplayer match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3F9Krh"&gt;The outage affected all the categories listed on the PSN’s status page — account management, gaming and social, PlayStation Now, PlayStation Video, PlayStation Store, and PlayStation Direct — all were marked as being down for about an hour (though reports of the outage started rolling in around 20 minutes before the status page lights started turning red).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBuKsy"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Players may experience an issue logging in through the PlayStation Network.

&lt;p id="8zaYDQ"&gt;During the outage, multiple&lt;em&gt; Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffers had difficulties downloading items from the store, playing multiplayer games, checking leaderboards, and loading the PlayStation app on their phones. Reports &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/playstation-network/"&gt;on Downdetector&lt;/a&gt; peaked around 44,000, after they started to flow in at about 5PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DruH1s"&gt;Sony didn’t reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sailor Moon’s newest movie is hitting Netflix on June 3rd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDoMRS7Et5rjq4Nfp37-0GKhozI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69196012/SME2020MVzenki.02412720200721_6814_1i5ylsp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie &lt;/em&gt;Part 1 and Part 2. | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HBpvgY"&gt;The newest movie in the hugely popular &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; franchise, &lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal The Movie &lt;/em&gt;(which was originally released in two parts), is hitting Netflix on June 3. The movie’s arrival on Netflix marks its premiere for the first time outside of Japan, where Part 1 debuted in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exqKNw"&gt;You can watch &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/_D2statICww"&gt;a teaser trailer for it here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rDuS3n"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D2statICww?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nVDyIe"&gt;Here’s Netflix’s synopsis of the film:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0YaJpj"&gt;The upcoming adventures are set in April, when the cherry blossoms are in bloom and Tokyo is in a festive mood as it celebrates the largest &lt;em&gt;Total Solar Eclipse&lt;/em&gt; of the century. As the new moon obscures the sun and gradually dims its light, Usagi and Chibi-Usa encounter &lt;em&gt;Pegasus&lt;/em&gt;, who is in search of the chosen &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; who can break the seal of the Golden Crystal. Meanwhile, a mysterious troupe called the &lt;em&gt;Dead Moon Circus&lt;/em&gt; appears in town who’s nefarious plan is to scatter the nightmare incarnations known as Lemures, seize the &lt;em&gt;‘Legendary Silver Crystal,’&lt;/em&gt; rule over the moon and the earth, and eventually dominate the entire universe…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1T1znX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty Guardian Sailor Moon Eternal &lt;/em&gt;is Netflix’s latest addition to its ever-growing anime slate. Anime is quickly becoming a key focus for Netflix — the company committed to launching 40 anime titles in 2021 alone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/27/22353848/netflix-launch-anime-ragnarok-zeus-resident-evil-streaming"&gt;just last month&lt;/a&gt;, as animation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349203/doj-crunchyroll-investigation-sony-att"&gt;becomes a front in the ongoing streaming wars&lt;/a&gt;. That lineup includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22373405/yasuke-netflix-flying-lotus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show about a Black samurai in feudal Japan that premieres on April 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ovZNx"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Sailor Moon&lt;/em&gt; movie joins Netflix’s already jam-packed summer movie lineup, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404701/netflix-summer-movie-preview-2021"&gt;which I wrote about earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on Apple MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various MacBook models available for purchase, including ones equipped with the new M1 processor, finding a deal on an Apple MacBook is not very hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals on the Mac mini computer. Of course, there are frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations, and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a full one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899 ($100 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; B&amp;amp;H Photo has &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604827-REG%2Fapple_mgn93ll_a_13_3_macbook_air_with.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price-matched&lt;/a&gt; Amazon, but only the silver and gold models are discounted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ADk8N"&gt;Amazon also has the 512GB configuration on sale; you can get it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5R2GQW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $1,170&lt;/a&gt; ($79 off) or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray for $1,180&lt;/a&gt; ($69 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1299, but it’s on sale for $150 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604811-REG%2Fapple_myda2ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can buy some older MacBook Pro models: one includes the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. It features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and storage configurations. You can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to the processor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and better speakers. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FZV45H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in space gray on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-16-Inch-Storage-2-3GHz/dp/B081FV1Y57?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another configuration available in the same color&lt;/a&gt;, but more storage (1TB) and an Intel Core i9 processor available for $2,499 ($300 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QLBQ9T"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the mini has Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We have seen this computer go down as low as $600 (for the base model), but you can get it currently for its usual starting price of $699 at &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738979441805036476#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604799-REG%2Fapple_mgnr3ll_a_mac_mini.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams usage jumps to 145 million daily active users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KrgEyJvpdH-oMM3vjFh1FmSm9O8=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195378/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0tcfT"&gt;Microsoft now has 145 million people using its Microsoft Teams communications app. This is another increase of 26 percent since Microsoft revealed Teams usage had jumped during the pandemic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537286/microsoft-teams-115-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;115 million daily active users in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Usage of Teams has spiked over the past year, with businesses continuing to flock to services like Teams, Slack, and Zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNJcT1"&gt;To put the 145 million figure in perspective, at the beginning of the pandemic, Microsoft had around 32 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241972/microsoft-teams-75-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;jumped to 75 million&lt;/a&gt; in a matter of weeks, and these numbers have more than doubled since even the early days of the pandemic. It’s an impressive amount of growth, just as Microsoft has been aggressively pushing businesses to move to the cloud and adopt Teams over the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GAKx51"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftTeams?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftTeams&lt;/a&gt; now 145 million daily active users    - thank you to customers, partners, and team&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Teper (@jeffteper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jeffteper/status/1387141320519557120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lsm0ak"&gt;As always, it’s difficult to compare to rival services. Google and Zoom don’t reveal daily active users and opt for a more vague daily active participants. This means a single user could be counted multiple times if they participate in different meetings during a day. Zoom revealed it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242421/zoom-300-million-users-incorrect-meeting-participants-statement"&gt;300 million daily active participants&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Google said last year it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240434/google-meet-three-million-users-per-day-pichai-earnings"&gt;100 million daily active participants&lt;/a&gt;. Slack revealed it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195092/slack-new-user-records-coronavirus-pandemic-remote-working-growth-concurrent-users"&gt;12.5 million concurrent users&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of the pandemic last year, but the company has shied away from daily active user counts ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiD8KK"&gt;Microsoft’s explosive Teams growth might explain why the service has experienced troubles this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405300/microsoft-teams-down-outage-worldwide-issues"&gt;Teams went down worldwide&lt;/a&gt; for many users for two hours this morning, after a similar outage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362975/microsoft-teams-xbox-live-down-outage-issue"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; and connectivity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22332539/microsoft-teams-down-outage-connectivity-issues"&gt;issues last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting live hockey, thanks to a new NHL deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Toronto Maple Leafs v Winnipeg Jets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1JG14zzwjy9W1dS0EsL13sKLd0w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195374/1232510519.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jonathan Kozub/NHLI via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsHUzz"&gt;Live hockey is coming to HBO Max, thanks to a new seven-year deal between the National Hockey League and WarnerMedia’s Turner Sports. The news may come as a bit of a surprise,  as, only a few weeks ago, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar said &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/hbo-max-warnermedia-streaming-jason-kilar-1234713108/"&gt;sports would not appear&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dVCGR1"&gt;Alongside HBO Max stepping into the sports streaming spotlight, Turner Sports also announced that TNT and TBS will air the Stanley Cup three out of the seven years outlined in the deal. (Specifically, WarnerMedia’s channels will air the championship series in 2023, 2025, and 2027, &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-turner-sports-reach-tv-deal-for-games-on-tnt-tbs/c-324075352"&gt;according to the NHL&lt;/a&gt;.) The remaining years will be hosted by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323789/disney-nhl-deal-espn-plus-stream-abc-hockey-sports"&gt;Disney’s ESPN Plus and ABC&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the sports league’s other major streaming deal, now that its contract with NBC is ending this year. WarnerMedia’s various properties will also be able to broadcast:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sbGKkQ"&gt;Half of the conference finals and half of the first two rounds of playoffs each season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vKHzPg"&gt;72 regular-season games per season&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jFK5Mq"&gt;The NHL Winter Classic each season (exclusively)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="WrRzOX"&gt;For any diehard cord-cutting NHL fan, this creates a tricky scenario. To make sure you’re able to watch the Stanley Cup for the next seven years, you’ll have to either alternate between HBO Max and ESPN Plus or use the NHL’s own streaming service, NHL.TV, if you live somewhere one of the other services isn’t available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2voS"&gt;ESPN Plus currently costs $5.99 per month, or $13.99 per month bundled with Disney Plus and Hulu. HBO Max costs $14.99 per month. NHL.TV costs $34.99 for an “All-Access Pass” to the 2021–2022 season or $29.74 for one specific team’s games. (The NHL says some games won’t be on NHL.TV if they’re available on local over-the-air TV.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYMhSS"&gt;Bringing live hockey to HBO Max is notable because the brand really isn’t known for live sports. Outside of airing some tennis and boxing, HBO’s biggest investment in sports media has come in the form of documentaries and series, including the Peabody Award-winning &lt;em&gt;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Px5NG3"&gt;While it may confuse the already-confusing HBO Max content library, having some kind of live sports programming increasingly seems to be table stakes for any streaming service that wants people to stay subscribed. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339636/nfl-streaming-deals-amazon-peacock-paramount-tubi-espn-plus"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; does it, Disney does it on &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/espn-plus-launches-hulu-1234927368/"&gt;Hulu and ESPN Plus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/paramount-plus-stinks-heres-why-im-subscribing-anyway#:~:text=Paramount%20Plus%20streams%20other%20live,streams%20and%20golf%20as%20well."&gt;ViacomCBS’ Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; also has a solid sports offering. If anything, WarnerMedia is doing the expected — which, for any hockey fan who’s already subscribed to HBO Max, should be a nice addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhW58P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijad6G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
