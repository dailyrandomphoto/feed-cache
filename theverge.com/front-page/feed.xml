    <title>Watch the first trailer for The Expanse season 6, arriving December 10th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/25G2lk6Rdeh02H3qcCZoLL7NGgo=/0x0:1442x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970676/expanse_season_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zmT8sG"&gt;The beloved, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/1/14429646/expanse-season-2-syfy-relevant-science-fiction-show-television"&gt;intriguingly political&lt;/a&gt;, and mysterious sci-fi show &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s final season on Amazon is nigh. Season 6 is coming December 10th, and the company just dropped the final trailer at New York Comic Con and on YouTube (you can watch it immediately above). It’ll run for just six episodes, airing each Friday on Amazon Prime Video and ending on January 14th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBmqvm"&gt;If you’ve been devoutly following &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;, you know things are &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; in the universe of the show. Earth’s on fire, beloved characters have died, and a mass murderer is gaining an awful lot of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjuCIh"&gt;Here’s how Amazon describes season 6: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="yldcWT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The sixth and final season of The Expanse picks up with the solar system at war, as Marco Inaros and his Free Navy continue to launch devastating asteroid attacks on Earth and Mars. As the tensions of war and shared loss threaten to pull the crew of the Rocinante apart, Chrisjen Avasarala makes a bold move and sends former Martian Marine Bobbie Draper on a secret mission that could turn the tide of the conflict. Meanwhile, in the Belt, Drummer and what’s left of her family are on the run after betraying Marco. And on a distant planet beyond the Rings, a new power begins to rise.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="o3MZ5V"&gt;How can Amazon possibly wind up the show in just six episodes? (A colleague points out to me that the books dedicate&lt;em&gt; three entire novels &lt;/em&gt;to exploring this current story arc in the show.) Well, my hope is that Amazon won’t exactly tie it up with a bow. While the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/26/17379736/the-expanse-amazon-prime-season-four-saved"&gt;did save the show in 2018&lt;/a&gt; after it got canceled by SyFy, showrunner Naren Shankar and actress Dominique Tipper (who plays Naomi) &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-expanse-amazon-season-6-naren-shankar/"&gt;both hinted to &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there could be life after Amazon, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74Tl1L"&gt;Perhaps Netflix, Hulu, or even Apple TV Plus (remember, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"&gt;snapped up &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a show based on seminal sci-fi work) might step in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRAjVy"&gt;There’s a shadow hanging over the series now, though, one that might make it less attractive to acquire: &lt;em&gt;The Expanse&lt;/em&gt;’s showrunners &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264503/the-expanse-season-5-finale-alex-kamal-cas-anvar"&gt;wrote Cas Anvar’s character (Rocinante&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;pilot Alex Kamal) off the show entirely&lt;/a&gt; after he was accused of sexual harassment and assault by &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheExpanse/comments/hi7c7q/designated_thread_for_discussing_cas_anvar/fweg1k1/"&gt;many women&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $322&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;You can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons or red and blue Joy-Cons for $300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/686350/9383?subId1=VergeNintendoSwitch072321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Console-with-Neon-Blue-Red-Joy-Con%2F709776123&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746299173080046926#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F11095819.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/768290/2092?subId1=VergeNintendoSwitch072321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F-%2FA-77464001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="fiSvia"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially went on sale on sale today, October 8th&lt;/a&gt;, for $350 and offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;At the time of this writing, the Nintendo Switch OLED is only available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKju4VpwZ5#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, however, both &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OHlcvPYhHQM&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt; had the hybrid console available at launch. If you go the Best Buy route, just make sure to log in to your store account before trying to add one to your cart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iPj5B1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="olD4z0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10738833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="HHzLVA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10640111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $49&lt;/a&gt;, though, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, has the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. While both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; currently have the controller available for full MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l1NCcr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://amzn.to/2YZPQpf" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TCPVHTM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; three-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Switch Lite is $6&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlFlVd"&gt;Right now, Eneba offers a discounted &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year, individual membership for around $21&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zjeasP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 1:21PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Best Buy is the latest retailer to launch Switch OLED consoles. You can find the selection, including bundles, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKlMGufcO5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;right here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. If you’re lucky, you might still be able to find one at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’re still waiting on Walmart, which may be gearing up to release some. We’ll update this post as the situation develops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3iwlA8"&gt;The newest version of the immensely popular Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED model, is now available online. Check out &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfKlMGufcO5" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s selection of consoles&lt;/a&gt;, which includes several bundles. Otherwise, you may still have luck purchasing one through &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jTTD6e"&gt;So far today, they’ve popped up at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-oled-console-white-joy-con%2F11149258.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, but they quickly went out of stock. It’s the same story &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;through Nintendo’s online shop&lt;/a&gt;. But now Amazon has unleashed some stock of consoles. You can find the model with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RKWHHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;, or the model that includes the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B098RL6SBJ?&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;neon red and blue Joy-Con here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSwcWy"&gt;We’ll add more retailers throughout the day as they appear online. We’re still waiting for Walmart to join in the fun, where there are currently landing pages that are listing both the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-White-Joy-Con%2F910582148" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white model&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-w-Neon-Red-Neon-Blue-Joy-Con%2F787152679" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue variant&lt;/a&gt; as being out of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CH79pi"&gt;The Switch OLED model is the top end of Nintendo’s current console lineup, coming in at $350, while the standard Switch and portable-only Switch Lite each sit below it at $300 and $200, respectively. The new model sports a sizable screen upgrade to a larger seven-inch OLED panel that provides much better color quality and brightness. It also brings some other niceties to the Switch, such as a sturdier kickstand with improved articulation, better audio in handheld mode, and an ethernet port built into the included dock. Its internal storage got a bump from 32GB to 64GB, too, but it’s still not a bad idea to get a microSD card, like this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB SanDisk model for $49 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHDJzw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Based on our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch OLED may not provide enough reasons for some to upgrade from their previous Switch, since it isn’t any faster or more capable when docked. That said, first-time Switch owners or those who want the best handheld experience when they step away from the TV should consider making the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T8iYcY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10640111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="LBaIGt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10738833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="59I8EI"&gt;Essential accessories, games, and subscriptions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="izJ3Se"&gt;If you do manage to snag Nintendo’s latest console, there are plenty of games and optional accessories we recommend picking up, including the excellent Nintendo Switch Pro Controller and recent hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22710468/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Below are a few of our favorites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="raxuBO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="b90geA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10793523"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>PC Building Simulator is free on the Epic Games Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XYcRUdXUYwuXZLBjOrpbD-uPQ_k=/0x400:1200x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970162/EGS_PCBuildingSimulator_TheIrregularCorporation_S2_1200x1600_43bc7f071217ef26e11f47d86093df10.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your key to the PC of your dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NSB4Rz"&gt;Depending on who you ask, &lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is either utterly ridiculous or incredibly satisfying. You can decide for yourself by downloading this niche simulator for &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/pc-building-simulator"&gt;free from the Epic Games Store before October 17th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DxpFUf"&gt;Like the majority of sim games, &lt;em&gt;PCBS&lt;/em&gt; speaks to a very specific type of fantasy. If your idea of a good time is overclocking your computer while managing a small business, this is a game that does exactly that. My favorite feature has to be making your work computer in-game look exactly like your computer IRL. The game will even adjust the RGB lighting and wallpaper of your machine to match.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xJDiPksPH9yZXWamwj_yU4qm_zM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908716/IMG_20211007_171514.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alice Newcome-Beill / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s just like my desk... except cleaner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8hkw0f"&gt;However, depending on your level of experience, the game can actually serve as a worthwhile educational tool for anyone who wants to learn more about... well, building PCs. As someone who had never built a PC prior to playing this game, I actually leaned on the knowledge I got from this game when I started building my own rigs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgHigC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; has received its fair share of DLC, mostly in the form of different workshop environments that are entirely cosmetic. However, it did get an esports expansion that's a little more narrative-focused and plays more like a timed puzzle game rather than a business simulation. It's also worth noting that the game regularly receives free updates that add new hardware to the already massive roster of cases, CPUs, GPUs, and other bits and bobs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qXwMB4KpEIpVJkADESvf-qoEDO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908722/Screenshot_2021_10_07_171756.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alice Newcome-Beill / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve spent entirely too much time in this game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NjmT4D"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Building Simulator&lt;/em&gt; keeps most of the fun parts of this hobby front and center, while cleverly avoiding some of the frustrations and occasional tedium. There are really only two things this game doesn’t simulate: misplacing that last thumbscrew and getting thermal paste on absolutely everything.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple removes the Apple Watch Series 6 from its official lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYWFlMkuzt0_wwbCBJd7o5Dp_Ag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69970023/vpavic_200929_4216_0121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtqCI4"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 is finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"&gt;available to preorder&lt;/a&gt;, nearly a month after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple announced the new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;. But the launch of the Series 7 also brings the removal of the Series 6 from the company’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fwatch%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;official Apple Watch lineup&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHP2Nv"&gt;If you want to buy a brand new Apple Watch from Apple, you now only have three options: the Series 7, which starts at $399; the still-very-good SE, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;introduced last year&lt;/a&gt; and starts at $279; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;years-old Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, which starts at $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFwQ27"&gt;There are still a few ways to get a Series 6, though, and given how many features are shared &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-6-vs-apple-watch-series-7/"&gt;between the Series 7 and the Series 6&lt;/a&gt;, the previous generation model could be a good option to consider if you want to save some money. Apple’s refurbished store has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fwatch%2Fapple-watch-series-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F8%2F22716438%2Fapple-watch-series-6-removes-lineup" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three different Series 6 models for sale right now&lt;/a&gt;, for example, and Amazon is currently offering many &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=apple+watch+series+6&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1"&gt;refurbished Series 6 watches at a discount&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo Smart Clock 2 review: a good dock with an okay clock</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A decent alarm clock on a slightly pointless smart display, it’s the new charging dock that makes this worth considering  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mYFC1M"&gt;Remember when alarm clocks were small, battery-powered, and lasted forever? My husband relinquished his compact Casio after 13 years because the screen finally warped and he couldn’t read the numbers anymore. That clock made it through countless Hot Shot tours fighting wildfire in Nevada and Idaho, survived in a makeshift shack in the Alaskan wilderness where he worked as a fishing guide, only to finally surrender after a couple years on his bedside table in a Charleston firehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGzkRg"&gt;Today, alarm clocks are going through a bit of an identity crisis, as evidenced by Lenovo’s newest Smart Clock that aims to be a nightstand multitasker. In very real danger of being entirely supplanted by smartphones, the alarm clock has morphed into an all-singing, all-dancing smart display. Go on, try to find a battery-powered alarm clock that just tells you the time. No projectors, no night lights, no built-in radio, no Bluetooth, no charging ports — just the time and an alarm. (When you do, can you send it my way? I’m looking for a Christmas present for someone...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6gvt0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10795689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ghGYtX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-smart-clock-2-with-wireless-charging-dock-abyss-blue%2F6481518.p%3FskuId%3D6481518&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo’s $89.99 Smart Clock 2&lt;/a&gt; has crammed as much functionality as possible into its tiny, almost five-inch by four-inch frame. It wants to be the Swiss Army knife of nightstands. Building on its first iteration as the smallest smart display on the market (ideally suited for your bedside), the Smart Clock 2 is still a Bluetooth speaker with a touchscreen and the full power of Google Assistant on tap to stream all the audio you could want. Of course, you can also ask about the weather and such, as well as control smart home devices with your voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU0kbc"&gt;What’s new is a separate dock designed for the clock that brings a night light, a wireless charging pad for your phone, and a USB Type-A port for your peripherals. Finally, you can corral all your bedside charging clutter in one space and have a fancy alarm clock (had you been waiting for that?). It still lacks any backup battery, so if the power is out, your alarm is off. To be fair, no smart alarm clock offers this, which is why my husband resolutely refuses to use one.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOm-6pciNJRU2wugYwaLh_Nj7Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909448/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2883_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Clock 2 comes with a new charging dock that includes an LED night light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vq3mwK"&gt;With a few caveats (which I’ll get to), this is a great little bedside clock albeit a minor upgrade from the original. It’s the smallest smart display footprint-wise, so a good fit for those with cluttered or tiny nightstands. The wireless charging and LED night light are excellent additions for keeping things tidy, although you’ll still need a bedside lamp as the night light is not for reading. There’s no camera in the device, and the small speakers provide just enough audio quality for some nice bedtime music and to deliver your choice of seven different alarm tones to rouse you in the morning. They sound better than a smartphone but worse than a larger smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cYXSS"&gt;As a smart display, it’s less appealing. Functionally, this is more &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/11/16453788/google-home-mini-smart-speaker-review"&gt;Nest Mini&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a smart speaker with some visual cues and a limited touch interface. While I like having the clock to glance at, the display feels largely wasted, and the interface relies — as most smart displays do — too heavily on voice control. For example, I couldn’t turn the night light off with touch, I had to use voice. This is frustrating particularly in the bedroom, where you’re most likely wanting a bit of quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEiFcY"&gt;The diminutive display also doesn’t do some of the main things you expect from a smart display. You can’t watch video and, while I question why you would want to on a display this small, if you’re not going to watch video you don’t really need a display this big (it’s a conundrum, I know). It will stream video from Google Nest security cameras, which is handy at night if something’s going bump outside. But it currently only works with the old Google Nest cameras, not the new ones or any third-party cameras. The screen also doesn’t give you extra visual information when you ask the Assistant questions, as Nest Hubs do, but you can pick a Google Photos album to rotate as your clock face throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RPG6jj9SDTak7ceOrBLLgDJH41U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902597/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2873.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Clock 2 has a selection of about a dozen clock faces to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YAl8DXStU6go4eg9tRun6qid3JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902593/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2855.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Volume up and down and a mute switch are the only physical buttons on the clock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aEhqPB"&gt;The Smart Clock 2 has a few design upgrades over the original. There’s a new color — fabric-wrapped blue in addition to gray or black (it’s all very drab, though; would it have killed Lenovo to throw in a pretty pastel?), and a new, taller form factor to accommodate sitting on the new dock. (You can buy the clock without the dock for $20 less, but you lose a lot of functionality.) The physical volume up and down buttons are still here, as is the mute switch at the back. The touch-sensitive surface between the volume buttons also remains to snooze or turn the alarm off (it requires a significant thwack, however). The USB Type-A port is gone — moved to the dock — which will disappoint some if they just opt for the clock and not the dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5zvNo"&gt;There have been no under-the-hood improvements, this is essentially the same device as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18647606/lenovo-smart-clock-review-specs-price-features"&gt;2019 Lenovo Smart Clock&lt;/a&gt;. The speakers have been rejigged and moved up front, but they’re the same tinny, 3-watt offerings, and the sluggish Mediatek quad-core processor remains. This translates to a slightly slower response time from the Google Assistant than on the newer Nest displays, which aren’t exactly speed demons. But the price has essentially dropped, as you can get the speaker and dock for $89.99, just $10 more than the original clock (you’re not going to find an up to 10-watt MagSafe compatible wireless charger for less than $20 anywhere else). It does require Wi-Fi to use the Google Assistant and other features, and you need to use the Google Home app on a smartphone to set it up. However, without Wi-Fi, it will function as just an alarm clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ML6yuhSQ6aN5Bgze_IeOTDz-iKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902592/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2862.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can choose an album photo from your Google Photos as the clock face, and it will rotate through the pictures.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm2iAR"&gt;I had this on my nightstand for about a week, replacing a Nest Hub (first gen), and I missed my Nest Hub. Most specifically because if I’m going to have a screen by my bed, I want to be able to use it. The Lenovo Clock’s four inches was just too small to comfortably navigate. Swiping up from the bottom (for brightness and volume control, a do not disturb button, and settings) was fiddly but not half as tricky as swiping from the top for quick access to alarms, a Routine shortcut, music, and the night light. No matter how many times I pushed on the night light button, it wouldn’t turn it off, and I had to use voice (there is an adjustable timer for the night light, so it will go out on its own eventually). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5wLZs"&gt;I also missed the smart home control panel. You get five swipeable screens on this display: clock, alarms, weather, music, and calendar. The only smart home control is a shortcut to your Goodnight or Good Morning Google Home Routine and the option to turn on or off the lights in the room you are in. If I asked the device to turn off the kitchen lights, it gave me a control interface for that light, which was useful, but again, I had to use my voice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9xzwk"&gt;I could probably get past these issues, mainly because I loved the wireless charger. Previous attempts at using a wireless charging pad by my bedside invariably resulted in finding it dead and buried in my dog’s bed in the morning as I managed to knock it off the charger during the night. With the Lenovo charging stand, my iPhone 13 felt secure thanks to magnets keeping it in place. Lenovo tells us these are small enough so as not to interfere with charging on Android phones. It can charge up to 10 watts, with a maximum of 7.5 watts on an iPhone, and only up to 5 watts if there’s also playing music. But even five is plenty to charge your phone overnight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uAhq2x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10791150"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnaRk2"&gt;The dock also looks elegant, adding a touch of sophistication to the nightstand. It’s a subtle pebble gray color with specks of blue for a textured look, a nice change from all those bright white charging stands. It conveniently doesn’t need its own cable; it takes its power from the clock, so you only have one cord to mess with. The night light is incorporated into the dock as an LED ring around where the clock sits. Helpfully, it lights up for a few seconds when you put your phone on the charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NWlRgG"&gt;The clock itself has a built-in ambient light sensor that adjusts the display’s brightness, so as not to blind you while you’re trying to sleep. (Pro tip: make sure you turn the brightness setting to Automatic by tapping the brightness icon until an A appears, or else you’ll be awake all night). But it does not have the screen technology that gives the Nest Hub that non-disturbing matte look. So while it dimmed suitably, it wasn’t quite dark enough for me. The Sunrise Alarm feature is also slightly less comfortable than on the Nest Hub, casting a harsher bluish light as it attempts to gently rouse instead of the softer, more orangey glow of the Nest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8SprL4DxpaFh71AUifr6T5YMPw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902598/j_Tuohy_051021__4793_2848.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magnets in Lenovo’s dock help keep MagSafe-compatible cases secure, handy if you like to thrash around a lot at night.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="o5ANoP"&gt;If you are looking for the smallest, most affordable way to put a smart screen on your bedside table — Lenovo fits the bill for just $70. Spend an extra $10, and you get the night light and wireless charger. Bargain. A Nest Hub is $99, and if you’re willing to go for Amazon’s Alexa as your built-in voice assistant, you can pay $85 for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt;, but both have larger screens and bigger footprints and no charging features. If what you really want is a smart alarm clock with a smaller footprint and no distracting display, the smaller form factor of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Lenovo Smart Clock Essential&lt;/a&gt; may be a better fit. You’re not giving up much on the alarm clock front, and you drop your cost to $50. But you don’t get that awesome dock with your clock.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max review: the one to buy</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The improvements are minor but worth the extra cash&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eDsKlK"&gt;The tech industry sure has put a lot of hype behind descriptors like “max” over the last few years. So when Amazon announced the $54.99 Fire TV Stick 4K Max last month, I couldn’t help but cringe at the idea of a streaming device picking up that kind of branding. What could max possibly mean in this context? It’s got nothing to do with the physical design; the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is visually indistinguishable from the existing Fire TV Stick 4K. And the two products go tit for tat in their core video and audio streaming features despite the older model often being discounted; at the time of this review, the regular Fire TV Stick 4K is on sale for $33.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQhV9y"&gt;In this case, “max” is actually about the smaller things. The new stick is 40 percent more powerful than the standard version, which results in apps launching faster and navigation that feels noticeably more fluid and free of stutters or lag. There’s more RAM inside so you don’t have to wait for apps to completely reload as often. Amazon has upgraded the Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi 6 for better wireless streaming performance — assuming you’ve got a router that can take advantage of it. And you also get a newer Alexa voice remote in the box with app shortcuts and a handy shortcut to live TV programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvTwxD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10795928"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjMJ2L"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the stick itself is impossible to tell apart from the standard Fire TV Stick 4K. Unfortunately, despite going “max,” Amazon apparently didn’t see fit to upgrade to USB-C for the (required) plug-in power; this device retains the Micro USB on its side. But getting up and running remains easy: plug the Fire TV Stick 4K Max into a free HDMI port on your TV, find an outlet for that USB power adapter, toss the included batteries into the remote, and you’re good to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqHF9U"&gt;Amazon bundles the latest version of its Alexa voice remote with the new streaming stick. Aside from the usual playback buttons, there are also dedicated TV controls for power and volume. And you’ll also find four branded shortcuts for Prime Video, Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu. (These can technically be reprogrammed, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/how-to-remap-the-app-buttons-on-fire-tv-edition-remotes-with-remapper/"&gt;but it’s quite a process&lt;/a&gt;.) You’ve still got to press and hold the Alexa button for voice searches or smart home commands. Speaking of which, one new trick the Fire TV Stick 4K Max gains over the regular model is the ability to see a live, picture-in-picture view of your home cameras. The Fire TV Cube can also do this, but not any of Amazon’s other streaming gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/REQKsS4DASf4N88SVnRuvZOFheA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909636/DSCF5770.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV Stick 4K Max comes with Amazon’s latest Alexa voice remote.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CReHlk"&gt;Another advantage of the newer remote is the guide button, which can quickly take you to live TV from supported services that integrate directly with Amazon’s channel guide. These include YouTube TV, Sling TV, Hulu with Live TV, Pluto TV, Tubi, and more. It’s not like the live TV tab is difficult to find on the Fire TV homescreen, but I’m always here for time savers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk2QFq"&gt;When it comes to their visual capabilities, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max and Fire TV Stick 4K are fundamentally identical. They both offer Dolby Vision, HDR10+, HDR10, and HLG. One quiet upgrade Amazon made to the newer hardware is support for AV1 video decoding, which will be welcome news to YouTube; AV1 decoding was one of the points of contention in the company’s very public spat with Roku. Amazon adopting the functionality should head off the possibility of a similar dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TyuQZm"&gt;Sound specs between Amazon’s two 4K sticks (each supports Dolby Atmos) are also &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to be the same, but this is one area where the newer stick pulls ahead because of… Netflix. For whatever reason, &lt;a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/dolby-atmos-surround-sound-audio-is-supported-in-netflix-on-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-max/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;AFTVnews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the streaming giant doesn’t support Atmos on the regular Fire TV Stick 4K because it runs an older version of the Fire OS software. Since the newer Stick 4K Max ships with the current Fire OS 7, you get the full Atmos experience when watching Netflix. If you’ve got an Atmos soundbar or surround system, that more immersive audio might be enough for you to spend extra on the Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5e4a7ZSE8MWLXGgntvyzRY9jFqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909639/football.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fire TV homescreen still puts a heavy emphasis on Amazon content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J1kMMKzJNaZ7jHBudjk5O3IFzWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909640/peek.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you hover over one of your favorite apps, you can see what’s popular.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSnB-Sb1L5YUXYStGmWk3Y_ciFU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22909643/livetv.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The live TV guide integrates with Sling TV, YouTube TV, and other services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a4cvTH"&gt;In keeping with the rest of Amazon’s Fire TV lineup, the Stick 4K Max runs the overhauled software experience that the company &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=21540615011"&gt;rolled out earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; with user profiles, a more personalized homescreen, and a new “find” feature for picking the night’s entertainment. Thanks to its more powerful CPU, GPU, and additional RAM (now 2GB instead of 1.5GB), the new stick breezes through navigating all the various corners of the Fire TV OS. And apps did seem to load up quicker than on the standard Stick 4K — and certainly faster compared to my Chromecast with Google TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8f6Vt8"&gt;That said, Amazon remains heavy-handed with banner ads on the homescreen and is still a little too in your face when promoting its own content. It’s possible to install a different launcher or set up Pi-hole to block some of the advertising, but that’s a step most consumers will never take. The reality is that this is just something you’ve got to put up with if you want a very capable 4K streaming device for under $60. If the ads drive you nuts, the more expensive Apple TV 4K or Nvidia Shield would be wiser choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="5vtft7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10795817"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idzlG3"&gt;There’s definitely a case to be made that the Fire TV Stick 4K Max should have just &lt;em&gt;replaced&lt;/em&gt; the slower Fire TV Stick 4K. Amazon’s lineup is now feeling crowded between the Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV Stick 4K Max, and the second-gen Fire TV Cube. The Cube is well distinguished as its own thing, but I can imagine some people would be very confused when shopping between the others. And Amazon discounts these devices so frequently that you’re really not looking at a giant price gulf between most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgP5Pv"&gt;So my advice is this: if you want Amazon’s best straightforward 4K streamer, spend the little bit extra and go with the new Fire TV Stick 4K Max. The speed enhancements really do make for a more satisfying user experience. And even if your home network isn’t yet running on Wi-Fi 6, you’ll have some future proofing in that respect. The Fire TV Cube remains more powerful still, but if you don’t need hands-free Alexa voice controls, it’s overkill for the purpose of entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2TAaG"&gt;I still don’t know whether it’s worthy of the Max moniker, but this is now definitely the Amazon streaming player to buy. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Grand Theft Auto trilogy is getting remastered for PC and consoles, including Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e0a0ByCxLdZ1241GIznxeEuw2eY=/38x0:602x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969467/gta3_android002.1323195668.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This still is from the Grand Theft Auto III: 10 Year Anniversary Edition, not the upcoming remaster.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot: GTA3&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PualCO"&gt;After several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623125/rockstar-gta3-vice-city-san-andreas-remaster-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc-mobile"&gt;rumors&lt;/a&gt;, Rockstar Games has confirmed that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;San Andreas&lt;/em&gt; are each getting HD remasters. They’ll be released in a package called &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;. The collection is coming to PC (via the Rockstar Games Launcher), PlayStation, Xbox, and, more surprisingly, the Nintendo Switch will host them, too. It will come to iOS and Android in the first half of 2022. Pricing and release date info hasn’t been shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6tBcp"&gt;The company hasn’t explicitly mentioned what kind of technical improvements were made, nor has it shared any footage yet. But it says that each of the games has gotten “across-the-board upgrades including graphical improvements and modern gameplay enhancements.” The company chose to take the faithful route for its remasters, leaving “the classic look and feel of the originals” how they were presented on PS2.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y-Xg96rw7smvVZjMNA9Wn0YtCUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910140/image003.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HotGQM"&gt;In case you’re someone who grew up with &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; (understandable, given it is eight years old) and haven’t had an easy way to play these earlier influential games, this seems like a great time to jump in. It might feel weird to play a &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; game that doesn’t let you swap between protagonists, but the adventures of Claude, the silent protagonist in &lt;em&gt;GTA III&lt;/em&gt;; Tommy Vercetti in &lt;em&gt;Vice City&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and CJ in &lt;em&gt;San Andreas &lt;/em&gt;are still very much worth playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omoQBY"&gt;Rockstar says that we’ll find out more about the collection of games in the coming weeks. But ahead of the launch, it’ll begin removing existing versions of each title from digital storefronts next week, so pick those up if you want them before you no longer have a chance. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your default browser in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8IAO-yddsFROKJiSFhQjwQcl7Q=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969424/Screenshot__84_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cb5cUv"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &amp;gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you — or if it did offer but instead sent you to the “Default apps” page — here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications,” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP, and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by clicking on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appear there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; is a small tool that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY2vh8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 2021, 1:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; What happens when some browsers offer to switch your defaults has been clarified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GHjRwI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="En3bnm"&gt;This week, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy editor Russell Brandom and managing editor Alex Cranz to cover the series of unfortunate events for Facebook: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;whistleblower interview&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;the massive Facebook outage&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, and the fallout and response the following days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRkn6B"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;crew discusses whistleblower Frances Haugen’s testimony, how these events stood out amongst the various Facebook scandals of the past, and what could happen next with tech regulation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5sGSk2"&gt;Later in the show, the team shift gears into the lighter tech news from this week: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google announcing its Pixel 6 event&lt;/a&gt; for this month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;review of Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, some updates on battery tests for the latest iPhones, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
