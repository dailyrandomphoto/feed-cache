    <title>Android 12’s dessert name might be Snow Cone, but we thought of 17 better ones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BkcHu0u8Fqv9lSN-LN_RLDSP5Ys=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822231/wjoel_180413_1777_android_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmsRY4"&gt;We’re eagerly awaiting to hear official news about Android 12, Google’s next major update to its mobile operating system, and we might have gotten an early look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274071/google-android-12-ui-screenshots-privacy-indicator-conversations-widget-leak-rumor"&gt;some big UI changes&lt;/a&gt; just last week, thanks to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;. But now, thanks again to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, we might know something even more important: Android 12’s dessert name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJU2lH"&gt;For years, Android releases were also identified with dessert names, and each year’s dessert started with the next sequential letter in the alphabet. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20827231/android-10-q-google-name-officially-announced-new-logo-wordmark-desserts"&gt;deserted the dessert names&lt;/a&gt; in favor of numerals with Android 10, but the company reportedly still uses dessert names internally. Android 11’s dessert name was apparently &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-11-red-velvet-cake/"&gt;Red Velvet Cake&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Android 12’s name? &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; says that &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-snow-cone-dessert/"&gt;it’s Snow Cone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpPWZI"&gt;Snow Cone is... fine. But if I’m being honest with you, I can’t think of the last time I’ve eaten a snow cone. And “Snow Cone” doesn’t immediately get my mouth watering like some of Google’s other classics, like “Ice Cream Sandwich”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjFZGK"&gt;The skeleton crew at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this fine Monday (it’s a &lt;a href="https://www.history.com/topics/holidays/presidents-day"&gt;federal holiday here&lt;/a&gt; in the US) felt we could do better. So we thought of 17 other dessert names that start with “S” that, in our opinion, would be more delectable names for Android 12:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mTcAqY"&gt;S’mores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TwfaTb"&gt;Salted Caramel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GXUCl5"&gt;Saltwater Taffy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eJH8bG"&gt;Sheet Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jX4Aao"&gt;Sponge Cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s3KpGi"&gt;Strawberry Shortcake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AoRH1f"&gt;Shortbread&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tlCk4O"&gt;Soufflé&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RWcAuC"&gt;Sundae&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YQ5jT6"&gt;Sherbet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RjokSX"&gt;Soft Serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6GTTvP"&gt;Stracciatella&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nLhJ4k"&gt;Sugar Cookie&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="omvSmE"&gt;Samoas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="y38w9k"&gt;Snickerdoodle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0ltKqU"&gt;Streusel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j6DB2b"&gt;Stroopwafel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PJkpSu"&gt;I hope you’re hungry after reading all those names, because I sure am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpxCvP"&gt;Other recent reports may point to other new rumors about Android 12. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-ui-changes-material-next/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “we have learned that Google has internally dubbed some of its notification UI changes as the start of the ‘road to Material NEXT,’” which could suggest broader changes on the way for Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/10/17339230/google-material-design-theme-update-new-tools-matias-duarte"&gt;Material Design guidelines&lt;/a&gt;. There may also be changes to the pattern unlock UI, Quick Settings panel, and more in Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCwQLU"&gt;Google may be implementing a one-handed mode for Android 12, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-ui-changes-material-next/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; also reported&lt;/a&gt;. And Google might introduce a way for Pixel phones to &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/pixel-android-12-auto-rotate-face-based/"&gt;check which way your head is facing&lt;/a&gt; to prevent rotating your screen when, for example, you’re lying sideways on your bed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku is testing a new, rechargeable remote — but it charges via Micro-USB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BHH18EQD3cfgzYRyKkw8VDsMliM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822033/akrales_161121_1270_A_0051.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQynBi"&gt;Roku is testing a new version of its remote control for its set-top boxes, the Roku Voice Remote Pro, which ditches the AAA batteries for a built-in rechargeable battery instead, &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-02/roku-rechargeable-remote/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Zatz Not Funny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pn1EP"&gt;Along with the rechargeable batteries the new model — revealed by Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/liezxf/finally_a_remote_with_a_rechargeable_battery/"&gt;u/KingTut206 over on the Roku subreddit&lt;/a&gt; — offers a few extra features, including a “lost remote finder” option and hands-free voice controls. (So you’ll be able to say something like “Hey Roku, find my remote” and have it pinged.) It also features two customizable buttons, in addition to the four pre-programed ones for streaming services that have partnered with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DC2iDHiqdSxOEt_L79p8UiiEZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22305617/mmi5g7z8t2h61.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/liezxf/finally_a_remote_with_a_rechargeable_battery/" target="_blank"&gt;u/KingTut206&lt;/a&gt; / Reddit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="milbtO"&gt;Unfortunately, the new remote charges via Micro-USB, not the more modern USB-C. It’s also not widely available right now: rather, the current release appears to be a limited early access test, with only 2,000 remotes being sold for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CHFEO"&gt;Hopefully, though, Roku will take the chance to upgrade the Voice Remote Pro before it launches more broadly. We’ve certainly got a few suggestions, if the company needs them: USB-C, wireless charging, and illuminated buttons are all good places to start. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after the latest update, Apple will fix it for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S8NRxvaxzLpT5URazYeJIb5Rq6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68822021/dseifert_200930_4218_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0foekY"&gt;Apple released watchOS 7.3.1 on Monday, and it could help fix an issue that prevents some Apple Watch Series 5 or SE smartwatches from charging while in the battery-saving Power Reserve Mode. But even the software update might not fix the issue, according to Apple. If it doesn’t, the company will repair your watch for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iziqA4"&gt;“A very small number of customers with Apple Watch Series 5 or Apple Watch SE models running watchOS 7.2 or 7.3 have experienced an issue with their watch not charging after it enters Power Reserve,” Apple says &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212180"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt;. If your Apple Watch still won’t charge after installing the update and after you put it on a charger for at least 30 minutes, the company asks that you contact Apple Support to set up a free mail-in repair. The company will have to inspect your watch to “verify that it’s eligible for free repair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LMS6U2"&gt;The watchOS 7.3.1 update is available for download now. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oe3Us7"&gt;Much of Texas has been hit by a historic winter cold front, leaving many &lt;a href="https://abc13.com/texas-power-grid-outages-rolling-blackouts-brownouts/10340431/"&gt;without power&lt;/a&gt; and affecting internet and cell phone services in the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sk6Be"&gt;Downdetector is showing spikes in user reports for &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/t-mobile/"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/att/"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; from Austin, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, and the surrounding areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IorgIH"&gt;“We’re experiencing network issues following severe weather in several areas of the country and especially across Texas,” T-Mobile president of technology Neville Ray &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nevilleray/status/1361376404563136512?s=21"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. “Our teams are working hard to restore service.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tDGOfj"&gt;In response to a customer reporting service issues in Meadows Place, Texas, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATTHelp/status/1361390049640779787"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s support account&lt;/a&gt; said that “our team is already working toward a resolution, bear with us.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i7SIiU"&gt;Verizon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Verizon’s network is performing well as winter storms make their way across the country with limited impact to our network operations.” However, “in a few pockets of the country, power outages have impacted the fiber we use to provide connectivity from each cell site to our switching facilities,” the company said. “Restoration crews have already begun work to restore power to those fiber assets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4stpY"&gt;Some internet providers have also said that customers may experience issues because of the difficult weather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVEFvM"&gt;“Spectrum customers in Texas are experiencing service interruptions related to winter weather causing commercial power outages and downed lines,” Spectrum &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Ask_Spectrum/status/1361353415331373061"&gt;said in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nothing company now owns the Essential brand, for some reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6e9tno6lcP2Pr6yrt2GFdlCB_mM=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68821688/Nothing_RGB_Signalweiss.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Nothing brand logo | Image: Nothing&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mwBx1i"&gt;Nothing, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22250653/nothing-brand-oneplus-carl-pei-announcement-consumer-technology-smart-devices"&gt;recently-launched startup&lt;/a&gt; from former OnePlus executive, Carl Pei, has acquired the Essential brand, according to a &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/15/essential-carl-pei-nothing-technologies/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; citing &lt;a href="https://trademarks.ipo.gov.uk/ipo-tmcase/page/Results/1/UK00003234098"&gt;filings at the UK Intellectual Property Office&lt;/a&gt;. Essential, of course, was the company started by Android creator Andy Rubin after he left Google. It launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16165040/essential-phone-review-android-andy-rubin"&gt;single smartphone&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134985/essential-phone-shutting-down-andy-rubin-startup"&gt;shuttering its doors&lt;/a&gt; due to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/12/17004278/essential-phone-2017-sales-90k-units-sold-six-months-post-launch"&gt;poor sales performance&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing’s acquisition, which was completed on January 6th, 2021, ahead of Pei’s formal announcement of Nothing, apparently includes all of the trademarks, logo, and other branding of Essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAEZBC"&gt;It’s not clear what Pei’s new company plans to do with the Essential brand (or anything else for that matter; the information on what exactly Nothing’s product plans are is as scant as the company’s name itself), but as &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes, there isn’t much aside from the brand left at Essential, since the company closed its doors last year. Essential had planned to release a follow up to the one smartphone it did bring to market, as well as launch an ambitious new smart home platform, but neither of those ever made it out of planning phases and were obviously scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jvWFjQekW0Spop3_Vz3AWcexzc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9070829/vpavic_170815_1924_0035.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Essential Phone was the only product Essential brought to market before closing its doors in 2020.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dgEnw2"&gt;It’s also not clear &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; exactly Nothing would want to acquire the Essential brand, which can best be described as “tarnished” after a failed product launch and association with Rubin’s name. A 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;detailed allegations of sexual misconduct levied against Rubin during his time at Google and a massive $90 million buyout he received for leaving the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="peQk1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; article says that Nothing will reveal more information about its forthcoming products in the near future, so perhaps we’ll learn more about what it plans to do with the Essential brand sooner rather than later. We’ve reached out to Nothing for comment on the matter and will update this article should the company respond.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="TSa8Kt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt;, which bundles all of the content from &lt;em&gt;Overcooked&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2 &lt;/em&gt;into one big package, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame"&gt;will be released&lt;/a&gt; on Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam on March 23rd, developer Ghost Town Games announced on Monday. Right now, the game is only available on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, so a lot more players will be able to jump into this combined bundle with the wider release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahNETK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat &lt;/em&gt;also serves as a remaster for the games, running at 60fps and a 4K resolution. The game also has faster loading times, which I personally am happy to hear about. Levels in the Switch version of &lt;em&gt;Overcooked 2&lt;/em&gt; sometimes loaded frustratingly slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oinIl7"&gt;Ghost Town Games also announced that &lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt; will be getting support for crossplay multiplayer on all platforms in an update coming “soon.” The game already supported &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/20/21331231/overcooked-all-you-can-eat-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;crossplay on PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s great to see that it will be expanded to all platforms. &lt;em&gt;Overcooked&lt;/em&gt; is a fantastic multiplayer game, and being able to play with friends no matter what platform they’re on will make it that much easier to experience some cooking mayhem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGRUtC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overcooked All You Can Eat&lt;/em&gt; also has some assist mode options and new accessibility features.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Parler is back online after a month of downtime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parler" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AeYclZRfXJchCHXOKzXGg4qDDk8=/0x3:5300x3536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820866/1297682530.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Y4kKA"&gt;The alternative social network Parler has reopened after a month offline. The company announced in a press release that the site is now accessible for users with existing accounts and will accept new signups starting next week. It’s also announced a new interim CEO: Mark Meckler, who previously cofounded the right-wing group Tea Party Patriots. The relaunch comes after Apple, Google, and Amazon suspended service in the wake of January’s attack on the US Capitol, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;violent threats on the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVZkbU"&gt;Old Parler user accounts have been restored, but old “parleys” — the site’s term for posts — don’t appear to have carried over. Some high-profile users, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, have begun posting on the new site already. The timelines for other major accounts, like fellow host Tucker Carlson or Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), remain empty. Many posts were previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;archived by an outside researcher&lt;/a&gt; who scraped them before its takedown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ukacpx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parler’s lawsuit against Amazon remains ongoing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dKjNeB"&gt;Parler describes itself as politically unaffiliated, but the loosely moderated site &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;became popular with conservative users&lt;/a&gt; who were either banned from larger sites or disagreed with the fact-checking and moderation policies of platforms like Twitter and Facebook. After the election, it became a hub for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;pro-Trump “Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which escalated into a deadly attempt to overturn the US election on January 6th. The site went offline on January 10th, when its old host Amazon Web Services suspended its account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMTHka"&gt;The platform has now relaunched with what a press release calls “robust, sustainable, independent technology.” Parler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;transferred its domain registration&lt;/a&gt; in January to Epik, a registrar known for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/08/965448572/meet-the-man-behind-epik-the-tech-firm-keeping-far-right-websites-alive"&gt;providing a haven&lt;/a&gt; to “deplatformed” far-right-friendly sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgDCqW"&gt;However, Parler remains in an uncertain position. Apple and Google haven’t restored its app to their stores, and it’s still fighting an &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/29095511/parler-llc-v-amazon-web-services-inc/"&gt;ongoing lawsuit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, where a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22231457/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-judge-preliminary-injunction-denied"&gt;appeared unsympathetic to its claims.&lt;/a&gt; Its previous CEO John Matze &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/ctech-us-parler-ceo-idCAKBN2A33B0-OCATC"&gt;said he was fired&lt;/a&gt; in early February, and the company is now “conducting a thorough search for a permanent CEO” who will replace Meckler. It’s also under scrutiny in Congress — where House Oversight Committee chair &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272562/parler-carolyn-maloney-fbi-financing-mercers-trump"&gt;Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) has requested documents&lt;/a&gt; on Parler’s financing and operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jaguar will be an all-electric car brand from 2025</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DuTEHCrYB7okSS0xvvVr6Z_P_8s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820591/jaguar_i_pace_ev_electric_0094.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean O’Kane / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o7XDdM"&gt;UK automaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) says its Jaguar luxury brand will be &lt;a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/reimagine"&gt;all-electric by 2025&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, its Land Rover brand will release its first all-electric vehicle in 2024, the first of six fully electric models planned for release over the next five years. JLR’s transition will be funded by a £2.5 billion (around $3.5 billion) a year investment into electrification and related technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-15/jaguar-going-all-electric-marks-new-ceo-s-turnaround-plan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHwCRH"&gt;JLR’s plans are ambitious, but the automaker has previously been slow to embrace electrification. It’s only fully electric car to date is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/3/30/17172678/jaguar-i-pace-drive-suv-new-york-auto-show"&gt;Jaguar I-Pace SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes has struggled to make inroads against more established electric carmakers. Even then, the car is built by a contractor, rather than being produced by JLR in-house. The company had to pay a £35 million (around $48.7 million) fine in the EU for missing emissions targets last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="31lMx1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thierry Bolloré, CEO, launches new Reimagine strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See us reimagine the future of modern luxury. Over the next five years, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LandRover?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@LandRover&lt;/a&gt; will welcome six all-electric variants and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jaguar?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Jaguar&lt;/a&gt; will undergo a renaissance as a pure electric luxury brand.&lt;a href="https://t.co/EcJzaiSk9Y"&gt;https://t.co/EcJzaiSk9Y&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Lp1DdKeuBB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Lp1DdKeuBB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jaguar Land Rover (@JLR_News) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JLR_News/status/1361259873950965764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6S3H6"&gt;The advantage JLR has is that Jaguar is still a premium car brand, allowing it to charge the high prices necessary to cover the cost of modern batteries. It also plans to share more technology with parent company Tata Motors to reduce development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7aHGJ"&gt;If all goes to plan, JLR expects all Jaguars and 60 percent of Land Rovers sold to be zero-emissions vehicles by 2030, the year its home market the UK will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21572312/uk-ban-combustion-engine-vehicles-sale-electric-cars"&gt;ban the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. JLR hopes to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2039. Bans of internal combustion engine vehicles have been announced with a variety of targets around the world, such as in Norway by 2025, France by 2040, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California by 2035&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new two-factor authentication prompt now has dark mode on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GpMYszpAqouDdghspGVUVsRFaqA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820538/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0ItVXI"&gt;Google is rolling out a new update for its two-factor authentication prompt on Android, which adds support for dark mode (along with a new Material Design-style look), &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/11/google-prompt-dark-theme/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7HLdQ"&gt;Is this objectively a minor cosmetic update in the great scheme of things? Yes. Is it nice to not be blasted with retina-searing white light when your two-factor authentication prompt comes up while you’re trying to log into something in pitch-black darkness? Also yes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vY5Seux7zLJOjiMf5yNijBP1Xxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304953/Screen_Shot_2021_02_15_at_10.22.52_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The old (left) and new (right) two-factor authentication prompts on Android&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N47OKL"&gt;In addition to the less blinding hue, the new update also features a couple of other minor cosmetic changes, including Google’s custom Google Sans font for the UI, and colorful red and green icons on the log-in buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9E7LDO"&gt;The new update appears to be rolling out slowly for Android owners — &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports that its available on personal Google accounts, but not for those with Google Workspace accounts. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2021, the Sundance Film Festival found art in Zoom, Instagram, and VR theater</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran Still" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n8SuiNGTF4V61PzrWG_gQJgdJ28=/4x0:1732x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68820492/50642699891_95cd68f0ae_k_d.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sundanceorg/50642699891/in/album-72157717027724041/" target="_blank"&gt;Sundance Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A New Frontier for a year at home&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nfc2Pr"&gt;In a Sundance Film Festival &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262520/sundance-film-festival-2021-pandemic-these-days-pink-cloud"&gt;defined by the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, the New Frontier section — devoted to experimental projects like virtual reality films and interactive performance art — was also radically reimagined. The section is often one of Sundance’s most intensely physical experiences; in 2020, it included a series of VR films viewed while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21125284/sundance-best-vr-ar-film-festival-new-frontier-2020"&gt;floating in a swimming pool&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, during an entirely remote festival, it pushed for something different: making our own homes feel otherworldly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29vwJs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/film/ntf/catalog"&gt;Pared down to 14 projects&lt;/a&gt;, this year’s New Frontier focused on web art and social media alongside virtual and augmented reality experiences. The result was a show that felt intimate and intriguing — and set a model for showcasing interactive art online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beyond the Breakdown Still" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W4zHWw81HGkuQJvMWtAvQBWR62Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304948/50643566927_6360efedc6_k_d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50643566927_6360efedc6_k_d.jpg" target="_blank"&gt;Sundance Institute&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lC860C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1a55f04818b094f6494d0"&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="OhiCnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by Tony Patrick, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Grace Lee&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MnRVkW"&gt;It’s tough to make a Zoom call feel profound, but &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/em&gt; comes close. Like &lt;em&gt;Tinker&lt;/em&gt;, the experience involves only a few people, all of whom dial into a web-based video chat. The chat is moderated by a Siri-like voice bot (controlled largely by a human operator), and it’s devoted to answering a simple question: what should Earth look like in 2050?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl3ftG"&gt;My session of &lt;em&gt;Beyond the Breakdown&lt;/em&gt; felt like an attempt to figure out the philosophical underpinnings of a better world, rather than predict the most plausible future or imagine the specifics of a utopia. That probably depends in part on the participants, but it’s helped by gentle prodding from the “AI”, which asks open-ended questions and chimes in with an occasional request to delve deeper. The whole experience benefits from its film festival context — while it might take place on the same screen as all your normal work meetings, it’s got an unusual sense of playfulness and optimism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran Still" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0aJeoLFrhm5HbRAgQN4TPCFAKoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22304946/50642699891_95cd68f0ae_k_d.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PBcgTR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd1897b63d677798fc3a7f1"&gt;Rich Kids: A History of Shopping Malls in Tehran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8Acuko"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created and performed by Kirsty Housley and Javaad Alipoor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Rd17O6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shopping Malls in Tehran&lt;/em&gt; is a tragic love story about the rich kids of Instagram — or more specifically, the rich kids of Tehran, a group of wealthy teens and twentysomethings shopping and partying under the shadow of social instability in Iran. Like a social media feed, it plays out in reverse: from two lovers’ fatal car crash just before dawn, through late-night drives and fights with disappointed parents and a surreal trip into the desert, all told through a combination of live narration and posts on a fictitious Instagram account. Slowly, the story expands from the doomed couple to a history of Iranian politics, the global oil industry, and the eponymous Tehran shopping malls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtPmQS"&gt;The piece was originally intended as an in-person performance, but the pandemic pushed it fully online, with Housely and Alipoor narrating the show alternately on a YouTube channel and in live Instagram broadcasts. The result perfectly channels the distraction of online social interaction — as audiences juggle their phones and laptop browser tabs to keep up with the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="4sk2Mj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tinker&lt;/em&gt; puts a twist on immersive VR theater, a genre where live actors play characters in virtual reality experiences, like &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/the-under-presents-impressions/"&gt;Tender Claws’ &lt;em&gt;The Under Presents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Oculus Quest project is about an affable inventor in a cozy late-’90s house. A handful of audience members join the scene. Most are invisible spectators, but one plays the man’s grandchild — who can take Polaroids, assemble toys, draw on walls with crayons, and talk to their grandfather over two decades’ worth of vignettes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv2cCX"&gt;If you’re the participant, the “acting” is pretty simple; you’re not literally pretending to be a toddler or a teenager. But it blends the feeling of having a personal conversation about your family with the understanding that you’re playing to an audience and want to make your scene at least a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; entertaining. And the setting is a great sandbox of toys that encourage engaging with the environment and actor. It’s a worthwhile followup to projects like the &lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/draw-me-close-childhood/"&gt;2017 Tribeca Film Festival experience &lt;em&gt;Draw Me Close&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://vrscout.com/news/sundance-scarecrow-vr-theater-with-live-actor/"&gt;2020 Sundance installation &lt;em&gt;Scarecrow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — with no physical contact but a more spontaneous feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="HOB3ox"&gt;&lt;a href="https://fpg.festival.sundance.org/new-frontier-info/5fd19cdc63d677735dc3a98f"&gt;To Miss the Ending&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wdJnF2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by Anna West and David Callanan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="v77H7Q"&gt;The physical world is dying. Machines have made human effort obsolete, and the only future is a virtual environment that approximates their old reality. The problem? None of the uploaded souls can agree on what reality was. While musing about their last days on Earth, they argue about whether a river is actually a road, whether an apartment’s stairs should lead to anything, and whether a tree belongs in the middle of a living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eN346a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To Miss the Ending&lt;/em&gt; is a melancholy, unsettling VR experience. Animated in jittering neon voxels that reflect the stories being told in voiceover, it turns a familiar dystopian science fiction conceit into a series of personal and bittersweet reflections on living to see the end of the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WNgkMh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Created by María Belén Poncio, Rosario Perazolo Masjoan, Damian Turkieh, and Ezequiel Lenardón&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4HLxaz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;4 Feet High VR&lt;/em&gt; is the bigger, more ambitious followup to another &lt;a href="https://www.sundance.org/projects/4-feet-blind-date"&gt;Sundance project from 2018&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a series of short VR films about Juana, a teenager in Argentina who’s navigating sex and romance after showing up at a new school. Juana uses a wheelchair, and the film is shot so we’re level with her height. But its unique cinematography is just a small part of the appeal. It’s a sweetly funny coming-of-age story about being young, awkward, passionate, and relentlessly sure that you can change a hostile world by having fun. The film would still be compelling without VR, but its 360-degree video completely shuts out reality and pushes you into Juana’s world — something that, during a year without movie theaters, traditional film simply can’t do.&lt;/p&gt;
