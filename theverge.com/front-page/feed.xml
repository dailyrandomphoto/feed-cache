    <title>Nintendo engineers suggest Switch Joy-Con drift will never be fixed</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UoljsC"&gt;One of the Nintendo Switch’s persistent flaws has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;been Joy-Con drift&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenon where players observe false inputs when they aren’t even touching the joysticks on the controllers.  Nintendo has been relatively quiet on the subject for years, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/10/22570868/nintendo-oled-switch-joy-con-drift"&gt;the company refused to say&lt;/a&gt; whether the new OLED-equipped Nintendo Switch OLED had fixed the issue. But today, the company is breaking its silence in a big way — and suggesting that Joy-Con drift may never be fully addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6ENQU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-4/"&gt;In a new Q&amp;amp;A about the development of the Nintendo Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, the company reveals  that it has steadily been making improvements to the Joy-Cons to try and make them more reliable. The joysticks that came with 2019’s Switch Lite aren’t the same as those in the original 2017 Switch, and they’re continually getting refined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF8na2"&gt;But Ko Shiota, a Nintendo executive who also serves as GM of Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, basically says that the Joy-Con will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; wear down over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pOfAuW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you mean that, basically, wear is unavoidable as long as the parts are physically in contact?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtIRq3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shiota:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, for example car tires wear out as the car moves, as they are in constant friction with the ground to rotate. So with that same premise, we asked ourselves how we can improve durability, and not only that, but how can both operability and durability coexist? It’s something we are continuously tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wqxr6F"&gt;The joysticks included with the OLED model “are the latest version with all the improvements,” as are the joysticks that ship with the base Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, Joy-Con controllers, and Pro Controllers, the company says. “The analog-stick parts have continuously been improved since launch, and we are still working on improvements,” says deputy general manager Toru Yamashita. When you get your Joy-Cons repaired, Yamashita says they’ll use the latest versions of those sticks for the repairs as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOt8WP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;The OLED Switch&lt;/a&gt; will be released on Friday, and we’ll have to wait and see if these improvements actually make the Joy-Cons more resilient to drift over time. But it seems that Nintendo never expects to solve Joy-Con drift entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5VILM"&gt;The full interview is long, but worth &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/2021/ask-the-developer-vol-2-nintendo-switch-oled-model-part-1/"&gt;reading in full&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s a rare opportunity to hear straight from Nintendo about how it develops hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has promised to actively look into right to repair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="microsoft logo stock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VzIDdZkF0oeKgvoBHx4ikxbp6jk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966690/DSCF1189.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1aWrGd"&gt;Microsoft has agreed to have an independent third-party study the potential impact of it making its devices easier to repair and to make changes based on those findings by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The agreement was made after As You Sow &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/6/24/investors-urge-microsoft-consumers-right-to-repair-electronic-devices"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking Microsoft to look into the potential impact that it could make by making it easier for consumers to get their devices repaired. &lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow has withdrawn its resolution&lt;/a&gt; in return for Microsoft conducting the study and making parts and documentation more available to repair shops that aren’t official Microsoft service providers based on the study’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d3xti"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.asyousow.org/press-releases/2021/10/7/microsoft-agrees-expand-consumers-repair-options"&gt;As You Sow calls Microsoft’s commitment&lt;/a&gt; “an encouraging step,” but it’s worth keeping in perspective that it is &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a step — what Microsoft has actually done today is said that it’ll have a study done and then use it to “guide” its “product design and plans for expanding device repair options,” according to a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by a Microsoft spokesperson. The fact that the company is at least willing to do that is encouraging and is more than other tech giants have done when it comes to right to repair. But without details, it’s hard to say how big of an impact this will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uOprCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft reportedly won’t release the actual study&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cIyGEA"&gt;It’s also unclear whether the public will end up getting those details or not. &lt;a href="https://grist.org/accountability/bowing-to-investors-microsoft-will-make-its-devices-easier-to-fix/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft will have to post a summary of the study by May 2022, but not the actual study itself (citing concerns over trade secrets). With that said, it should be easy to tell if Microsoft is sticking to its word on this — either it’ll become easier to get your Surface Pro or Xbox repaired at a third-party store, or it won’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQHFEY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grist&lt;/em&gt; also quotes iFixit’s US policy directory, which brings up Microsoft’s lobbying efforts. &lt;a href="https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/who-doesn%E2%80%99t-want-right-repair-companies-worth-over-10-trillion"&gt;According to the US Public Interest Research Group&lt;/a&gt; (or US PIRG), Microsoft has been involved in lobbying against right-to-repair laws in Colorado and Washington. If that kind of behavior continues, it would be hard to give Microsoft props for any positive work it does for right to repair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LBAxPv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;iFixit calls Microsoft’s agreement a “huge, landmark move”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fn3Xcg"&gt;Despite the caveats, right to repair supporters see this agreement as a good thing. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kwiens/status/1446167245965586432"&gt;iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens called it&lt;/a&gt; a “huge, landmark move” on Twitter and, in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, said that it “wasn’t just talk,” citing the Surface Laptop’s improvements in repairability over the years. PRIG’s right to repair campaign manager also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “the real deal” and cited it as evidence as Microsoft “changing its tune” about right to repair. If it does end up making significant changes, Microsoft could end up ahead of the curve when it comes to reducing its products’ impact on e-waste and emissions — both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570826/president-joe-biden-executive-order-right-to-repair"&gt;President Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587331/right-to-repair-apple-iphone-ftc-lina-khan-open-meeting"&gt;FTC&lt;/a&gt; have been working to clamp down on companies illegally making it harder for consumers to get their devices repaired.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is moving its headquarters to Austin, Texas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBeIuQXMq1BcSbrvCMwxAPosKLs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966672/sokane_181116_3101_fremont_0062.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H3TdHf"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said Thursday that the company is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas, where it has been building a new factory for a little more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1oFlw"&gt;Musk said Tesla will continue to operate its electric vehicle factory in Fremont, CA, and that he even plans to try and increase production there by 50 percent. “Just to be clear, though, we will be continuing to expand our activities in California,” he said during the company’s annual shareholder meeting. “So this is not a matter of Tesla leaving California.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7t56j"&gt;The move means Tesla’s home will no longer be the state where its vehicles are the most popular; instead, Tesla will be headquartered in a state &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22457455/tesla-texas-factory-law-ship-out-of-state-direct-sale-legislation"&gt;where it can’t legally sell its cars&lt;/a&gt; directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oB5ISE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this is not a matter of Tesla leaving California”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kin2Qr"&gt;Musk had previously threatened to pull Tesla’s entire operations out of California in 2020, because of how vehemently he disagreed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242102/elon-musk-coronavirus-fascist-shelter-in-place-tesla-covid-19-safety-science"&gt;the shelter-in-place orders&lt;/a&gt; the state used to help keep people safe early in the coronavirus pandemic. Tesla even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21253127/elon-musk-lawsuit-alameda-coronavirus-tesla-fremont-lockdown"&gt;sued the county that the company’s California factory is in&lt;/a&gt; as a form of protest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48rC05"&gt;Musk himself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163805/elon-musk-texas-moved-california-tesla-spacex"&gt;moved to Texas&lt;/a&gt; last year, as SpaceX dramatically increased its presence in the southern tip of the state. The Tesla CEO said at one point that he thought California had become too “complacent” with respect to its residents and businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4ORqJ"&gt;Tesla started building its next US Gigafactory outside Austin in 2020 and has made an incredible amount of progress in the intervening year. “We’re going to create an ecological paradise here.. on the Colorado River,” a reference to how the company plans to open up parts of the land it bought to the public. Musk said Thursday that Tesla is also looking at doing more “major installations” of battery storage like the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-03-08/tesla-is-plugging-a-secret-mega-battery-into-the-texas-grid?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;one first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Ew1FPw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The epic campaign to win Elon Musk’s Tesla factory with memes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TkfBfx"&gt;Musk previously said that Tesla chose to build in Austin over other locations because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375891/tesla-tulsa-cybertruck-factory-elon-musk-statue-memes"&gt;employees were more willing to move there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31sQhJ"&gt;“There’s a limit to how big you can scale it in the Bay Area,” Musk said Thursday, adding that “it’s tough for people to afford houses [in California].” Tesla’s Austin location is also right near the local airport, which Musk said is convenient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t8pN9K"&gt;Tesla will be moving to Texas at a time when many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22656392/lyft-uber-legal-fees-drivers-lawsuit-texas-sb8-abortion-law"&gt;businesses have found themselves under pressure to leave&lt;/a&gt;, after the state recently passed one of the most restrictive anti-abortion laws in the country. After the law was passed, Texas’ Governor Greg Abbott used Musk and Tesla as an example to try and prove this was not a trend &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-says-he-prefers-to-stay-out-of-politics-after-texas-governor-cites-his-support-11630627238"&gt;during a CNBC interview&lt;/a&gt;. Abbott said in September that “Elon had to get out of California because, in part, of the social policies in California,” and that Musk “consistently tells me that he likes the social policies in the state of Texas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2zIw2"&gt;Musk responded to that clip in a tweet, saying he “believe[s] government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hN0gqH"&gt;“That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbV7ge"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ireland’s status as tax haven for tech firms like Google, Facebook, and Apple is ending</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Daily Life In Dublin During COVID-19 Pandemic" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ecAb1FhBrpAVFNXojRpTl2b_Zbo=/0x37:5890x3964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966603/1233382967.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google in Dublin | Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSVGtj"&gt;Ireland said Thursday it &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/press-release/59812-ireland-joins-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;would join an international agreement&lt;/a&gt; that sets taxes on profits for multinational corporations at a minimum rate of 15 percent. This is a major shift for the country that is the European headquarters for many large US pharmaceutical companies, as well as tech firms, including Google, Apple, and Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QIsgP"&gt;An increase from Ireland’s current 12.5 percent to 15 percent may not seem that large by itself. The so-called Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Inclusive Framework agreement, outlined in July, is actually a two-pillar plan aimed at helping end tax avoidance and making international tax rules fairer and more transparent. The OECD has &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/tax/beps/about/"&gt;estimated&lt;/a&gt; that a 15 percent tax rate would generate some $150 billion in global tax revenue annually and would help to stabilize the international tax system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE36Ic"&gt;Ireland signed on to the deal ahead of a Friday meeting at the OECD among the 140 countries that have been negotiating its terms for several years. The plan calls for global companies to pay taxes in countries where their products or services are sold, even if they don’t have a physical presence there, and would apply to multinational companies with revenues above €750 million (about $867 million). For companies with revenues below €750 million, the 12.5 percent rate would remain in effect in Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVeFW8"&gt;Over the past several decades, Ireland has served as a tax shelter for many large tech companies, thanks to its low corporate tax rate. Companies typically create Irish subsidiaries of their companies that license their intellectual property, on which the subsidiary pays royalties. Some 800 US companies have operations in Ireland, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.amcham.ie/"&gt;American Chamber of Commerce Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, employing about 180,000 people. &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/11/apples-cork-campus-celebrates-40-years-of-community-and-looks-to-the-future/"&gt;Apple opened its first plant in Ireland&lt;/a&gt; in 1980 and now employs some 6,000 people on its campus in the city of Cork. Facebook established its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;international headquarters in Dublin in 2008&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2008/10/facebook-to-establish-international-headquarters-in-dublin-ireland/"&gt;Google opened its European headquarters&lt;/a&gt; in Ireland in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y34ICX"&gt;Irish finance minister Paschal Donohoe said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.ie/en/speech/615f7-statement-by-minister-donohoe-on-decision-for-ireland-join-oecd-international-tax-agreement/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Thursday that the agreement will “address the tax challenges of digitalisation.” Donohoe added that he believes companies will still choose to locate their headquarters in Ireland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34KCdt"&gt;“I am confident that Ireland will remain competitive into the future, and we will remain an attractive location and ‘best in class’ when multi-nationals look to investment locations,” Donohoe said. “These multinational enterprises support our economy with high value jobs, and at the same time, Ireland provides a stable platform and a long proven track record of success for MNEs choosing to invest here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKurZd"&gt;If the OECD agreement moves forward, its provisions are expected to take effect in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The easy way to install Windows 11 on unsupported CPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5lmPBaowSm6K9tTnlXj3rDhAlk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966581/windows_11_unsupported.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P3lVTM"&gt;Did you take one look at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705406/windows-11-upgrade-checklist-cpu-tpm-secure-boot-dual-iso-clean-install"&gt;our hefty Windows 11 upgrade checklist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;nope &lt;/em&gt;right out of there? It turns out there’s a &lt;em&gt;dramatically &lt;/em&gt;easier way to install Windows 11 on computers with older CPUs — with no need to reformat your drive, erase your files, or even burn the ISO to an external USB drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EDdj2D"&gt;If you’re currently seeing “This PC doesn’t currently meet Windows 11 system requirements” or “The processor isn’t currently supported for Windows 11,” there’s a Microsoft-approved registry hack that should instantly make it better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ctV4uU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10795968"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="alJDVo"&gt;(We’ve tested this method working on a Dell XPS 15 with Core i7-7700HQ and a Microsoft Surface Go with Pentium Gold 4415Y, neither of which are on Microsoft’s compatibility list.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nb9SE8"&gt;Here’s the whole process from start to finish in three easy steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IComo0"&gt;1) Download the Windows 11 ISO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gCQ4Vc"&gt;You’ll need to download the ISO. In our testing, this trick doesn’t work with the Windows 11 Install Assistant, it doesn’t trigger Windows Update, and it doesn’t fool Microsoft’s PC Health Check tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTynku"&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindows11" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On this Microsoft page&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Download Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO).&lt;/strong&gt; Open the &lt;strong&gt;Select Download&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown, pick &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt;, hit the &lt;strong&gt;Download&lt;/strong&gt; button, select your product language from the &lt;strong&gt;Choose one&lt;/strong&gt; dropdown that appears below, hit &lt;strong&gt;Confirm,&lt;/strong&gt; then click &lt;strong&gt;64-bit Download&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PmIZoh"&gt;While that 5.1GB image is downloading, let’s move to step two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aCgc6L"&gt;2) Edit the Windows Registry to bypass the CPU check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="30quIz"&gt;In Windows, hit &lt;strong&gt;Start &lt;/strong&gt;and type &lt;strong&gt;regedit&lt;/strong&gt;, then hit enter to launch the &lt;strong&gt;Registry Editor.&lt;/strong&gt; Navigate to &lt;strong&gt;Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup&lt;/strong&gt;, either by pasting that whole address into &lt;strong&gt;the box just beneath “File, Edit, View, Favorites, Help” &lt;/strong&gt;or by drilling down through the &lt;strong&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;System&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MoSetup&lt;/strong&gt; folders one at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AI890u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10795972"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pG5L5V"&gt;In the right pane, right-click and pick &lt;strong&gt;New &amp;gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value&lt;/strong&gt;. Name the value “&lt;strong&gt;AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU” &lt;/strong&gt;minus the quotes. Double-click on the new value you created, and enter &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; into the &lt;strong&gt;Value data&lt;/strong&gt; field. Hit &lt;strong&gt;OK &lt;/strong&gt;and close the registry editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QnycYq"&gt;3) Open the ISO in Windows Explorer and launch setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bKCbJB"&gt;Did the ISO finish downloading? Just right-click on it and pick &lt;strong&gt;Open with &amp;gt; Windows Explorer&lt;/strong&gt; to mount the virtual disc, then double-click the &lt;strong&gt;setup&lt;/strong&gt; file to begin installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tK50o"&gt;That’s it! If the registry hack worked, you should soon see a warning message instead of a rejection message — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686457/windows-11-health-check-compatible-supported-cpu-old-pc-waiver"&gt;Microsoft reserves the right to withhold security updates if you go this route!&lt;/a&gt; — and be given the option to install Windows 11 without losing your data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Firefox’s address bar has ads now, but you can disable them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVsPZjUBMkwtqnWB8_6a58ooxQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966530/acastro_200207_3900_firefox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2wVhKH"&gt;Mozilla introduced a new suggested search result feature in the Firefox address bar as part of &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/93.0/releasenotes/"&gt;the 93.0 release of its browser&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not too surprising — Firefox Suggest, Mozilla’s feature for “surfacing relevant information and sites to help you accomplish your goals,” is similar to suggestions offered by most browsers. But &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/760177/firefox-is-getting-ads-in-your-search-bar/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;How-To Geek&lt;/em&gt; spotted&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/navigate-web-faster-firefox-suggest"&gt;support pages&lt;/a&gt;, it also includes content from paid advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ7aRO"&gt;“When contextual suggestions are enabled, Firefox Suggest uses your city location and search keywords to make contextual suggestions from Firefox and our partners, while keeping your privacy in mind,” the support post reads. The “relevant suggestions” from “trusted partners” appear at the bottom of the usual search suggestions pulled from your bookmarks, browser history, and open tabs — a less intrusive version of a search ad, but technically still an ad. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LMLqyxH6XNvqY-eyLAadFir_0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908519/firefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see results from partners at the bottom of Firefox Suggest results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEbSXp"&gt;According to the support page, Firefox Suggest doesn’t require any new data to be “collected, stored, or shared to make these new recommendations,” and the company only works with partners that meet Mozilla’s privacy standards for Firefox. The feature has also been kicking around since at least the previous 92.0 release, even though it first appeared in the current version’s release notes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MMB838Qir7f6MI97-bM_dtVi94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908730/disablefirefoxsuggest.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Mozilla&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can disable Firefox Suggest in settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iEmzP2"&gt;After updating to the newest version of the browser, Firefox might present you with a pop-up asking if you want to enable “contextual suggestions” or adjust your settings. If you accidentally enabled any of the  Firefox Suggest features without realizing it, you can still disable them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tHNYnV"&gt;Click on the hamburger menu and then select Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EZLxFD"&gt;Click on Privacy and Security in the sidebar and scroll to Address Bar — Firefox Suggest&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G8ADPT"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for contextual suggestions to turn the feature on or off&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RFAhFN"&gt;Select or deselect the checkbox for “occasional sponsored suggestions”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yuO8AK"&gt;It’s slightly disappointing to have to manage a feature like this. Firefox is a popular alternative to browsers like Google Chrome because it’s stricter with users’ privacy and generally less data-hungry. If you trust Mozilla and want to support it, Firefox Suggest might not be a huge bother. It’s also not the first time the company has dabbled in advertising — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17326184/firefox-ads-sponsored-content-pocket-suggestions"&gt;Mozilla incorporated paid advertiser links&lt;/a&gt; and Pocket article reading suggestions in new tabs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s browser is now available for its Wear OS smartwatches</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Galaxy Watch 4 Classic and Galaxy Watch 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vceeJObRzlEBHUmcTc9T0oe_EVQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966520/dbohn_210816_4717_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s latest smartwatches.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N0i2wd"&gt;Samsung has brought its Samsung Internet web browser to the new Wear OS-based Galaxy Watch 4 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Browsing on a watch doesn’t sound like my ideal way to surf the web for a long period of time, but I could see how it could be useful for small tasks like checking a name or looking up a place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztCSdZ"&gt;I don’t have a Galaxy Watch 4, so I can’t give you hands-on experience of how the Samsung Internet browser works. But based on &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/07/samsung-browser-galaxy-watch-4/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google’s&lt;/em&gt; testing&lt;/a&gt;, it seems like Samsung has thought of some neat tricks to make it possible to navigate the web on your wrist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XBhlGR"&gt;An obvious question about a web browser on your wrist is how exactly that tiny, circular display can manage to show full webpages. Samsung’s answer is with gestures. A guide will come up when you navigate to your first webpage that explains a diagonal swipe from either side of the screen will allow users to get to the corners of a webpage. Meanwhile, a swipe up reveals options for bookmarks, “Zoom mode,” and a shortcut to send the webpage directly to your connected phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="meVthU"&gt;This new browser only adds to what you can already get with the Galaxy Watch 4 series of smartwatches, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;which we thought were pretty good&lt;/a&gt; — as long as you’re already using a Samsung phone, that is. It should be noted that a browser on a smartwatch isn’t new, though; Samsung also has a browser for its &lt;a href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/geardetail/com.samsung.wbrowser?langCd=en"&gt;Tizen-based smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;, and even the Apple Watch has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17841742/apple-watch-update-new-features-os-5-release-date"&gt;built-in browsing capabilities&lt;/a&gt; (though there’s no dedicated Apple Watch version of Safari).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cutCkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Galaxy Watch 4 review: welcome to Samsung’s garden","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Foundation is getting a second season on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="foundation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VtdNWXYfaDAmzgSvjlnHAlIBfhQ=/552x0:3432x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69966466/Foundation_Photo_010201.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pUeTI8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt; has been renewed for a second season on Apple TV Plus, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftv-pr%2Fnews%2F2021%2F10%2Fapple-tv-renews-global-hit-drama-series-foundation-for-a-second-season%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F7%2F22715363%2Ffoundation-renewed-second-season-apple-tv-plus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple announced today&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the release of the fourth episode of the first season on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="okqv8M"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s Foundation starts out big, lavish, and a little boring","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690292/foundation-apple-tv-plus-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="caQlc3"&gt;The renewal is a vote of confidence from Apple, as one of the flagship shows on Apple TV Plus, meant to help bring in viewers as a prestige genre show in the same way that &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; does for HBO, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; does for Disney Plus, or &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix. That said, outside of today’s press release (where Apple calls the show “a global hit” that “quickly proved to resonate with audiences”), the company hasn’t even provided vague estimates of how popular the show has been so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xecQq"&gt;“With season two, our audience will get to visit more of Asimov’s indelible characters and worlds, including Hober Mallow, General Bel Riose, and all the Outer Suns,” showrunner and executive producer David S. Goyer said in Apple’s press release, indicating that the second season will at least in part cover the latter half of Asimov’s &lt;em&gt;Foundation,&lt;/em&gt; as well as its sequel, &lt;em&gt;Foundation and Empire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPOE56"&gt;Goyer has big ambitions for the series, too; in an interview &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/david-s-goyer-interview-1234983774/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he mentioned that his original pitch to Apple was eight seasons long. And while Apple hasn’t publicly commented on how much the lavish series costs, Goyer mentioned that “if you were to take two episodes and put them together, the budget is bigger than some of the movies I’ve done.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2k4Mq"&gt;Apple’s announcement doesn’t say which (if any) of its season one cast members will be returning for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. But given the anthology nature of Asimov’s novels — which are a collection of short stories that span centuries of time — it’s likely that a second season would bring new faces to the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ONCmVY"&gt;Whether Apple is willing to pony up for the full 80 episodes that Goyer envisions to properly tell his story is still an unanswered question, but with a second season on the way, it seems that &lt;em&gt;Foundation &lt;/em&gt;fans will at least get to see the entirety of Asimov’s first book adapted in live-action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7vBlJ"&gt;The remainder of&lt;em&gt; Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s first season airs weekly on Fridays on Apple TV Plus; no release date for &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;’s second season has been announced. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Product Red edition of the Series 6 has often recieved the biggest discounts.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ozqXgk"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It might be tempting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;preorder one of the recently announced Series 7 models&lt;/a&gt;, but new Apple hardware always comes at a premium. The latest version of the Apple wearable offers a slightly larger display and some improvements to durability but is largely the same Apple Watch we’re familiar with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxsAXI"&gt;Each Apple Watch model offers ample functionality and has seen more than its fair share of discounts over the last year. So which ones should you consider if you’re in the market for Apple’s popular smartwatch while trying to shop smarter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently four Apple Watch models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463618/apple-watchos-8-features-watch-wwdc-2021"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model — and the highest end — is the Apple Watch Series 7, which starts at $399. Last year's model, the Series 6, has received a modest discount at some retailers since its release but is still usually found starting at $399. If either of those models is a little too rich for your blood, however, you can save about $120 by opting for an Apple Watch SE, which will set you back $279.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tA5jd3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to preorder the Apple Watch Series 7","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22664661/apple-watch-series-7-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date"},{"title":"Should you wait for the Apple Watch Series 7? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674258/apple-watch-series-7-upgrade-worth-waiting-for"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, there’s the four-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt;, the most affordable Apple Watch to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. However, if you want something more future-proof, you may want to consider Apple’s newer watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will issue software updates to the Series 3 beyond watchOS 8 and the current update process for the Series 3 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419569/apple-watch-series-3-software-update-reset-bad-experience"&gt;become a bit of a pain point&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of which model you prefer, we’ve rounded up the best Apple Watch deals below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hdRa4b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199. It’s a good entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and excellent build quality, especially if the SE, Series 6, and Series 7 seem out of your price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Right now, there aren’t deals available on the 38mm Series 3, which is only available for its standard price of $199 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYnqufKYm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1161528/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-series-3-gps-38mm-space-gray-aluminum-case-with-sport-band-black%2F-%2FA-54101052%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df%26fndsrc%3Dtmnv%26DFA%3D71700000087521670%26CPNG%3DPLA_DVM%252B0064R00001AFOp3QAH-Apple_GoogleSearch_AO_Q4_FY21_AO%26adgroup%3DPLA_Apple%2BAirTag%26LID%3D700000001393753pgs%26network%3Dg%26device%3Dc%26location%3D9004339%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwtfqKBhBoEiwAZuesiJUi6dcVJIyvV2yp8_t07QEQXzMl8yEsT1GQ2bYjHatSoPfkIJXtHxoC6DAQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. For that price, you might as well spring for the larger, 42mm configuration; both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K3HG6T9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F742230355%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; have knocked the price down from $229 to $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zc5j8W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741240"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable that shares some features found on the like-minded Series 6 and Series 7, including a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. However, it doesn’t have the always-on display found on Apple’s latest flagships, nor does it feature blood oxygen monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCEnn"&gt;Right now, you can pick up the 40mm, GPS-equipped version in white at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1141873/1143052/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F555062032%3Fselected%3Dtrue%26%3D%26irgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_zLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DzLjVYQ2UGxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkBXlQ2B1yfEVg0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $275 — a minor $4 discount — or for full price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B09G93BDQP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfJYfu2GpGW" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking for the larger 44mm model with GPS, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38733&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fapple-watch-se-gps-44mm%2Fprod25100056" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt; are offering it at a slight discount of $299, though, the latter is only exclusive to Sam’s Club members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="23GjQy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10741223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="rUGNYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, which start at $399 and $429, respectively. The Apple Watch Series 6 features built-in sleep tracking, a great ecosystem of third-party complications, and more sensors than previous models, including one that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PfLoQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="60XJAV"&gt;Deals often come and go quickly on the Series 6. If you don’t mind a bit of vibrancy on your wrist, however, the 40mm, GPS-enabled red configuration usually sees the biggest discounts with the most frequency. That said, the red and blue models are both seeing a steep discount at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, with both retailing for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8KuZ3"&gt;If the larger, 44mm Series 6 is your fancy, it’s available in red at &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F847051571%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5P53JK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $379, slightly more than its best-ever price and evidence of the major discounts the red versions can sometimes see. Other colorways, including the pink (&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1149510/9383?sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F683927568&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;facet=shelf_id%3A9987250&amp;amp;search_sort=100&amp;amp;_be_shelf_id=9987250" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5SQ3MG/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;) and white models (&lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F351352991%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-44mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5V1YWL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;), are available for $415 at the same retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rn8JJi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10598305"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J2hTVr"&gt;A note on the more premium models&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="7aHrsm"&gt;While all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum, Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings have similar designs to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel, brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $749 and above, and they are functionally the same, save for some exclusive digital watch faces Apple reserves for these premium models. Overall, the upmarket stainless, titanium, and Hermès edition Apple Watches don’t usually get the discounts and sales as the aluminum models, where the deals are often to be had.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google and YouTube will cut off ad money for climate change deniers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5TFjnh6ir5kwdKu91SpykoqB3Ac=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69965820/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoHg1u"&gt;Google will no longer allow advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators to monetize content that denies the existence of climate change. The company detailed the changes &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;in a support document&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOxbM6"&gt;“Today, we’re announcing a new monetization policy for Google advertisers, publishers and YouTube creators that will prohibit ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change,” the Google Ads team said in the document. “This includes content referring to climate change as a hoax or a scam, claims denying that long-term trends show the global climate is warming, and claims denying that greenhouse gas emissions or human activity contribute to climate change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ3ybf"&gt;Google says it will use a mix of automated tools and human reviews to enforce the policy. “When evaluating content against this new policy, we’ll look carefully at the context in which claims are made, differentiating between content that states a false claim as fact, versus content that reports on or discusses that claim,” Google said. Ads will still be allowed on climate topics like public debates on climate policy, research, and more, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWCsgW"&gt;The increased action against climate change deniers marks Google’s second big misinformation policy change in recent days, arriving about a week after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700171/youtube-vaccine-misinformation-antivax-ban"&gt;YouTube banned vaccine misinformation&lt;/a&gt;. It follows new features announced by the search giant intended to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711623/google-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions-carbon-footprint-maps-search-travel"&gt;shrink their carbon footprints&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
