    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9BQujQ"&gt;Summer is here, and for many families, that means it’s finally time to take the vacation they’ve been postponing for the past 18 months. With vacations comes travel, and with travel comes bored kids, so it’s crucial to have something to entertain them when they’re in the car or on a plane for hours on end. Amazon’s got you covered today with discounts across its lineup of kids-specific Fire tablets, including the recently released Fire HD 10 Kids and HD 10 Kids Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDRLwm"&gt;The kids versions of the Fire tablets are essentially the same hardware as the standard models and come in 7-, 8-, or 10-inch sizes. They include a kid-friendly case with a built-in kickstand, two years of protection against damage, and a year’s subscription to Amazon’s Kids Plus service, which provides a kid-friendly interface and access to age-appropriate games, apps, video, and books on the tablets. Each size is available in specific versions for ages 3 to 7 or ages 6 to 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aNCh7N"&gt;The base 7-inch model normally costs $100, but Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07H8WS1FT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted it to $60 today&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with 16GB of internal storage, has up to seven hours of battery life, and charges via Micro USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4XrKsd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zcnkrR"&gt;If you step up to the 8-inch version, you not only get a larger screen, but you also get double the storage (now 32GB), twice as much RAM, a faster processor, up to 12 hours of battery life, and USB-C charging. Amazon normally sells this version for $140 but has it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale for $90 today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZWvXG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648106"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wt16bS"&gt;The top-tier 10-inch version, which was just updated earlier this year, includes a bigger, better-quality screen, an even faster processor and more RAM, and up to 12 hours of battery life with USB-C charging. This model’s regular price is $200, but today’s sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Kids-tablet/dp/B08F62DV1Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brings it down to $130&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9krmZG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648113"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MqdWia"&gt;No matter which model you go with, it’s smart to also grab a microSD card to expand the amount of offline storage you have for it. The Fire HD tablets let you save games, videos, books, and apps for offline use, which is great for in the car or on a plane. A reliable, 64GB Sandisk microSD card should cover even the longest trips and can be &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-ULTRA-microSDXC-Class-SDSDQUA-064G-A11A/dp/9875981818?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;picked up for $11&lt;/a&gt;. If you’ve got two kids, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-microSDXC-UHS-I-Adapter/dp/B0735NNFLQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-pack of that same card is $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RM1lsz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10648119"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="E2WPnz"&gt;
&lt;p id="PTmSsQ"&gt;If you’re looking to treat yourself to some silence on that road trip, Woot has the &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals071221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-anc-wireless-earbuds-international-model%3Fref%3Dw_gw_dd_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro for $120 today&lt;/a&gt;, a discount of $80 off their regular price and considerably less than the typical sales we’ve seen so far. The Buds Pro provide active noise cancellation to help block outside sound and last for five hours between charges with it enabled. The version Woot is selling is the international model, which has the same specs as the US version, but comes with a 90-day warranty provided by Woot instead of the full-year warranty through Samsung. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AGyeWR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZOtCWL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="atWkb2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s too late for Black Widow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jy6hRzcjkc9rsPI4wnyaO2AcSYE=/0x0:4089x2726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69570210/7845a8b610b38e85a4395b809d7764c6_4096x2726_322c95ed.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Marvel’s latest film thoroughly skewers the franchise’s portrayal of Black Widow... far too late&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WjXd57"&gt;It’s hard to be a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe’s Black Widow. She sticks out like a sore thumb. On a team of super-powered guys (and Hawkeye), she fills the less cinematic “master manipulator” and “weird sexy martial art flippity flips” roles. Her story until &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; has been about as nuanced and impactful as that of Smurfette’s. When she has been given more to do than pose in front of explosions or take people down with her thighs, the storylines have been so heavily critiqued they’ve turned punchline in their own right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3mUxs"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; she was crammed into a hamfisted romance with the Hulk that was immediately mocked in &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt;. Her big swan dive into oblivion in &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt; for the sake of her “boys,” the Avengers, is repeatedly mocked in her titular film, &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. For the first heroine of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Natasha Romanoff often feels like a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slytherinus/status/1413556375104507913"&gt;big joke&lt;/a&gt;. And this attempt to rehabilitate her posthumously feels like far too little far too late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ve7b31"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Black Widow,&lt;/em&gt; director Cate Shortland and screenwriters Jac Schaeffer and Ned Benson are clearly trying to recontextualize Natasha Romanoff and find a genuinely interesting character buried under a decade of oversexualized junk. The problem is that’s really hard to do. This character carries a lot of baggage — way more than Wanda Maximoff — who Schaeffer handily rehabilitated in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0c41lG"&gt;Wanda could have a bad rap in the films, but she is also still alive by the end of each chapter in her story. She can be transformed into a dynamic character with wants and desires beyond what a handful of male directors shunted onto her in a few films. Natasha Romanoff doesn’t have the same luxury. She can’t be dynamic because her story is already told. We’ve already witnessed her endgame. She tells Hawkeye she’s a not-great person and the least she can do is kill herself so some men, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/movies/avengers-endgame-questions-and-answers.html"&gt;her “boys,” can live&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; creaks under the weight of this future. The filmmakers build up a rich and nuanced life for her that doesn’t revolve around the Avengers. It’s meant to be a curtain pulled back; an exploration of what made her tick and what led to her decision to swan dive into oblivion. Instead it feels like desperate and sweaty justification for &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/avengers-endgames-women-deserved-more-1834388344"&gt;a widely maligned move&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXcRqA26xdQdMtzFXUQuIqtNpAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708798/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Costuming subtly hints that maybe the skintight catsuit is a Natasha Romanoff choice and not a Black Widow one.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh9f8M"&gt;It’s not the filmmakers’ fault that Natasha Romanoff has been the “sexy Avenger” all this time. It’s not their fault that Spider-Man got a movie before Natasha or that &lt;a href="https://www.themarysue.com/black-widow-flash-mob/"&gt;the character was missing from so much merchandise&lt;/a&gt; it inspired multiple hashtags. Black Widow has been short shrifted for years. One film with a handful of very good jokes was always going to struggle to make up for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOZGIH"&gt;But the filmmakers do try to fix what was broken before they came along. In one of the standout moments of the film, Natasha is eluding a worldwide manhunt while doing absolutely nothing to change her appearance. As she drops some cash for snacks at a gas station her adoptive sister Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh, pointedly begins mocking Natasha’s tendency to pose and flip her hair after doing something athletically impressive. It’s extremely funny, and a great character moment — a sister ragging on one of the most humorless heroes in the MCU. It’s the filmmakers speaking through Yelena, chastising a decade of fetishization by Jon Favreau, Joss Whedon, and the Russo brothers while neatly establishing that Yelena will be different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw2LSp"&gt;“See,” Marvel seems to say. “We get that we told women to wait their turn for a decade. We acknowledge our sins and would like you to overlook them because Pugh and Johansson have great chemistry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8aYPv"&gt;I spent a lot of the movie torn between being annoyed at the cookie Marvel was meting out and actually loving the taste of the thing. Then the movie embraces the gallows humor one would expect a bunch of lifetime assassins and spies to engage in, when Natasha and Yelena go into graphic details of their forced sterilization as a joke. The movie later descends into the rote beats of the MCU’s more militaristic fare, but this moment, which savagely addresses a key and controversial plot point from &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt;, makes it all almost feel like it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBgJ2Ak77xOdOrZFtNjPXjt9dTw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708810/4410b599399a2b532e05d490c46f60da_4096x2725_ca977a97.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Natasha and Yelena are the kind of sisters who would make fun of their own extreme trauma.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BEuJSK"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; Natasha tearfully breaks up with Bruce Banner, who she has apparently hooked up with between movies. When he begs to know why they can’t be together and assumes it’s because he turns into an uncontrollable green monster on occasion, Natasha says no. It’s because &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; is the monster. She was forcibly sterilized in the Red Room and can never have children. The &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/black-widow-this-is-why-we-can-t-have-nice-things-1702333037"&gt;criticism of Black Widow’s arc&lt;/a&gt; was severe, particularly her infantilizing relationship with the Hulk. &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://ew.com/article/2015/05/04/joss-whedon-quits-twitter/"&gt;Joss Whedon reportedly even left Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to avoid it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MgXWu"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;Yelena, and then Natasha, go on a black comedy riff over their barren wombs to the discomfort of the Red Guardian, who acted as their father in a spy-op 20 years earlier before turning them over to the Red Room to become Black Widows. Where once Natasha said it made her a monster, here it’s something to joke about with her younger, similarly affected, sister. It feels more genuine, and certainly less maudlin, than crowing about being a monster before finding a facsimile of motherhood in crooning lullabies to a giant green man. This was the Black Widow of the comics, and the promise of the character as seen in &lt;em&gt;Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; (and to a lesser extent &lt;em&gt;Civil War&lt;/em&gt;): an assassin with a pitch-black sense of humor, using it to make her pretend spy dad uncomfortable for his complicity in her child soldier past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeM7NR"&gt;It’s a pity Natasha is still dead, and Scarlet Johansson is done with the franchise, because for a few minutes we got what we’d been promised 12 years ago when &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2009/film/markets-festivals/emily-blunt-rumored-for-iron-man-2-1117998515/"&gt;Emily Blunt was first rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be joining the nascent MCU as Black Widow. Like Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth, she spent over a decade of her career on this franchise. They each got a trilogy of films interrogating their character’s purpose in the MCU. She got a prequel trying to soften the blow of her abrupt departure. The movie was fun, and there are moments in it that are even excellent, but it all feels like far too little, far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="CBeBXj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567297/black-widows-post-credit-scene-explained-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;Thanks to a post-credits sequence&lt;/a&gt;, we know Pugh is next headed to the Disney Plus show &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;. Let’s hope her Black Widow is treated a little kinder by the MCU. But as she’s already being pitted against Jeremy Renner and Hailee Steinfeld’s Hawkeyes, I wouldn’t get too optimistic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Redesigned iPad mini reportedly on track to launch this fall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJ0aAJjD9jNtttzB5l9X8brVSD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69569608/akrales_190318_3298_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5rP4CJ"&gt;Apple plans to release a new iPad mini featuring “the biggest redesign in [its] nine-year history” this fall, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-11/apple-card-would-rival-amex-platinum-and-chase-sapphire-reserve-kqzi5vme?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/11/ipad-mini-redesign-larger-imac-apple-silicon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The new device is expected to feature slimmer bezels, a larger display, faster performance, and a design similar to Apple’s new iPad Air from last year, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/12/sixth-generation-ipad-mini-this-fall/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;. It could be a big shakeup for Apple’s smallest tablet, whose design has remained remarkably consistent since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/10/30/3576178/apple-ipad-mini-review"&gt;its debut in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zE0Oy5"&gt;The news tallies with &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s previous reporting about the upcoming device, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518167/2022-ipad-pro-wireless-charging-new-ipad-mini-2021-date"&gt;it said last month&lt;/a&gt; could ditch the home button to allow for narrower screen bezels. Reports of an iPad Air-style design suggests it could use a Touch ID sensor built into a side-mounted power button. Last year, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/05/14/ipad-mini-apple-glasses-kuo/"&gt;analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicted&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s next iPad mini could have a screen that’s 8.5 to 9-inches in size, up from the 7.9-inch display the mini has always sported. Kuo has also previously suggested a future iPad mini &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/03/apple-14-1-inch-macbook-pro-mini-led/"&gt;could use a similar Mini LED display&lt;/a&gt; to what we recently saw in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;Apple’s largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QTfFwn"&gt;The new iPad mini would be the 6th generation of the tablet, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;a 2019 redesign&lt;/a&gt; that added support for the Apple Pencil stylus alongside a faster A12 processor. As well as the new iPad mini, Gurman also reports that Apple also has another Apple Silicon powered iMac on the way with a larger screen than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;recent 24-inch model&lt;/a&gt;. The new device is reportedly intended to replace the existing Intel-powered 27-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Foxconn and TSMC strike deal to buy 10 million COVID vaccines for Taiwan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TAIWAN-ECONOMY-SEMICONDUCTORS-TECHNOLOGY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P10GTPH7I8QtQ0VPdCaOM3ZmnbI=/5x0:4775x3180/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69569542/1231936348.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N5Z5i0"&gt;Foxconn and TSMC, two Taiwanese giants of the international tech supply chain, have agreed to buy 10 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for the island in a move that dodges a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22539799/taiwan-vaccine-negotiations-tsmc-foxconn-china-interference"&gt;standoff between Taipei and Beijing&lt;/a&gt;. The two companies will be paying up to $35 a dose of the BioNTech vaccine and donating them to the government; each company has pledged to spend $175 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaLXVT"&gt;BioNTech is partnered with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Co. to distribute its mRNA-based vaccine, which was co-developed with Pfizer, within China. Taiwan claims that the Chinese government blocked an attempt to secure a supply of vaccines from BioNTech, and later refused an offer of vaccine donations from the mainland. With the new arrangement, however, BioNTech and Fosun are being allowed to deal with private companies rather than the Taiwanese government, which Beijing views as illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVmBhB"&gt;“Since we proposed the vaccine donation and started negotiating for the purchase, there had been no guidance or interference from Beijing over the acquisition,” Foxconn founder Terry Gou wrote &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/TerryGou1018/posts/1201726933633910"&gt;on Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, in remarks translated &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/COVID-vaccines/Foxconn-and-TSMC-sign-350m-deal-to-buy-COVID-vaccines-for-Taiwan"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We appreciate that the negotiation was allowed to go through as a business matter.”&lt;/p&gt;

TSMC is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry, manufacturing chips to spec for the likes of AMD, Apple and Nvidia; it’s responsible for the majority of smartphone SoCs worldwide. Most of Foxconn’s manufacturing happens in China and other countries, but TSMC’s main operating base is in the Hsinchu region of Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UKxLqR"&gt;Taiwan has been widely praised for its response to the pandemic, but is currently experiencing an outbreak that has killed more than 700 people and hastened the demand for vaccines. Last week the government said that a little over 14 percent of the population, or about 3.3 million people, had received one vaccine shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVnBS3"&gt;TSMC and Foxconn say the newly secured BioNTech doses will be shipped from its factories in Germany and should start to arrive in Taiwan from late September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked device lineup may have been entirely spoiled in huge new leak</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c_XAJ-m4N_IHv_0MM-zJOyt6i5o=/0x35:608x440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568466/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_3.56.50_PM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3, from GIFs shared by leaker Evan Blass.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fmaqzO"&gt;We might now know a lot of what’s coming at Samsung’s next Galaxy Unpacked event thanks to a series of tweets from noted leaker Evan Blass. It seems like the event could be a big one, as Blass tweeted a long thread with GIFs of two new Galaxy foldables, a new Galaxy FE phone, two new Galaxy Watches, and even a set of new Galaxy Buds. He also says the event is set to take place &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734346138300423"&gt;one month from now on August 11th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqej9"&gt;First up, the foldables. Blass has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;already leaked&lt;/a&gt; what appear to be official renders of the rumored Galaxy Z Fold 3 (which could support the S Pen stylus) and Galaxy Z Flip 3, but the new GIFs he shared give looks at both devices at all angles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLbvNC"&gt;Here’s the Z Fold 3, which Blass shared GIFs of in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734357328699396"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734378996371456"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6izswb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zbFJvcSfv9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zbFJvcSfv9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734368472932353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oBafbK"&gt;And here’s the Z Flip 3, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734389691953152"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734410827046913"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734420817891330"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfD1KQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/cLlE0ot4fO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLlE0ot4fO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734400420896768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp100o"&gt;Blass’ thread also includes GIFs of what look to be the rumored Samsung Galaxy S21 FE in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734430577938432"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570"&gt;a yellow-ish gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734449896992771"&gt;purple&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734459933958145"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;. The phone, if released, will likely be a mid-range version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;the S21&lt;/a&gt; and looks to take a lot of design inspiration from the Samsung flagship (like how the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; looked similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21172039/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-review-camera-5g-screen-android"&gt;the S20&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzXdQR"&gt;Whether or not this phone is actually in production has been something of an open question; in June, in response to a report claiming Samsung had stopped production of the phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;Samsung said that&lt;/a&gt; “nothing has been determined regarding the alleged production suspension.” These GIFs from Blass might be a sign that the phone is a go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPJmT8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/ovz5bzR8me"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ovz5bzR8me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734440250093570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mzQagF"&gt;But Blass didn’t just share GIFs of phones — he also tweeted GIFs of two new Samsung watches. One model seems to match closely with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558761/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-smartwatch-news-rumors-features"&gt;rumors of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic&lt;/a&gt;, with what appears to be a rotating bezel and two buttons on the right side. The watch, which Blass tweeted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734469920509952"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734490271322114"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, is also expected to run &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22550828/samsung-mwc-2021-one-ui-watch-smartwatch"&gt;Google and Samsung’s new smartwatch platform&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TdDWiU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/A090015v7k"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A090015v7k&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734479907151873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uSPP4H"&gt;The other watch shared by Blass appears to match &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546997/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch"&gt;rumors of the Galaxy Watch Active 4&lt;/a&gt;. This watch doesn’t look to have a rotating bezel, and according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnLeaks/status/1407653639011905539"&gt;&lt;em&gt;OnLeaks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.giznext.com/news/giznext-exclusive-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-5k-renders-details/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GizNext&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it might come in two different sizes: 44mm and 40mm. Blass shared GIFs of the watch in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734503168741380"&gt;gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257"&gt;dark green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734530045915137"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734543111163906"&gt;peach&lt;/a&gt;, and two tweets of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734555039805443"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734567089950721"&gt;watch&lt;/a&gt; (though I can’t tell the difference between them besides what’s shown on the screen). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z2PZ7z"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/Ej15bzU6nE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ej15bzU6nE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734516322144257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kBPt5"&gt;Blass’ GIF thread also reveals three colors of unannounced Galaxy Buds that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/27/22552705/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-leaked-renders-four-colors"&gt;match rumors about the Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt;, which, according to leaker Ice Universe, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1412399234419023875"&gt;will have active noice cancelation&lt;/a&gt;. Blass’ GIFs show the buds and the inside of the white case in gray, purple, and white, matching the style of a leaked render &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-official-renders-design-colours-exclusive/"&gt;shared by &lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that showed green, black, and white bud / inner case combos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JpGAqU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/zt54JopQzc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zt54JopQzc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan Blass (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1413734590846492674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RmpeuP"&gt;Finally, let’s talk quickly about that rumored date, August 11th, which to me seems like the one you might want to circle on your calendar. When Samsung showed off its smartwatch platform developed with Google at the end of June, it said there would be an Unpacked event “&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/mwc-2021-samsung-presents-new-watch-experience-with-a-sneak-peek-of-one-ui-watch"&gt;later this summer&lt;/a&gt;,” so August 11th would fall in that timeline. And the company has hosted summer Unpacked events in early August for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17665284/samsung-galaxy-note-9-watch-bixby-home-speaker-news-unpacked-event-2018"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20754898/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus-5g-book-s-pen-unpacked-event-2019-biggest-announcements-news-recap"&gt;years&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21350066/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-note-20-event-biggest-announcements-products-recap"&gt;now&lt;/a&gt;, meaning August 11th wouldn’t be out of the usual pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuHLqO"&gt;Since Samsung hasn’t officially announced any of these products or the date of the event, there’s always the chance that what Blass leaked doesn’t actually come out. But given Blass’ past track record and the detail of the GIFs he shared, it seems possible he may well have revealed some of the biggest news from Samsung’s next Unpacked event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Black Widow has been a big hit on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MKlpuWW2xfFert6I-lkxqOy5dCA=/0x8:1231x829/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69568084/fbg7020_comp_v003.1049_r.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQzNME"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is the first Marvel movie to debut on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1096468/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fblack-widow%2F3VfTap90rwZC" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus &lt;/a&gt;the same day it hit theaters, and based on financial figures Disney released on Sunday, the movie has been very successful on the streaming service in its first weekend, where it is available as a Premier Access title. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/black-widow-opening-weekend-box-office-1234789473/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the movie has earned $60 million in sales on Disney Plus, which isn’t far behind the $80 million it earned in domestic box office sales and the $78 million it earned internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znuZCK"&gt;Disney first introduced the Premier Access program, which lets Disney Plus subscribers stream select new movies for $30 the day they debut in theaters, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;with 2020’s &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346947/black-widow-cruella-luca-disney-plus-streaming-premiere-access-marvel-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were also available on Premier Access when they were released this year. But these &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; figures are the first Disney has shared about how a film has performed on Premier Access, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reports, and they indicate that streaming at home is still a popular way to see the film even though taking a trip to the movies is an option for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YoJL3q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s only one more Premier Access movie on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh12Rv"&gt;However, it’s not clear if Disney will be offering many movies through Premier Access going forward. The only remaining Premier Access film in the pipeline (that we know of) is &lt;em&gt;Jungle Cruise&lt;/em&gt;, which will be released &lt;a href="https://www.thewrap.com/jungle-cruise-to-debut-in-theaters-and-on-disney-premier-access/"&gt;in theaters and on Disney Plus on July 30th&lt;/a&gt;. And Disney has already announced that &lt;em&gt;Free Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings &lt;/em&gt;(which is the next Marvel flick)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are debuting exclusively in theaters on August 13th and September 3rd, respectively (though they’ll have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434964/disney-theatrical-window-45-days-shorter-streaming-shang-chi-free-guy"&gt;a shortened 45-day theatrical exclusivity window&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FikuqR"&gt;Disney also isn’t the only one turning its focus back to theater-first debuts: Warner Bros. will return to releasing films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346613/warner-bros-theatrical-releases-2022-hbo-max"&gt;exclusively on the big screen in 2022&lt;/a&gt; after premiering all of its 2021 movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. But perhaps the strong performance of &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on Premier Access will make Disney consider releasing future titles on Disney Plus when they hit theaters. (If anyone from Disney is reading this, I’d love to watch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the comfort of my living room when it comes out.)&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zaBt6YgXSp1VGAqTK4nXk4eZH4I=/0x40:1792x1235/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567895/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_11.13.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Req545"&gt;On Friday, when I wrote about how a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; for the NES &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;sold for an eye-popping $870,000 at auction&lt;/a&gt; and set a new record for the most expensive video game ever sold, I wondered which game would be the first to sell for more than a million. Just two days later, I have my answer: a sealed copy of the Nintendo 64 classic &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-64-wata-98-a-sealed-n64-nintendo-1996-usa/a/7261-28137.s"&gt;sold for an astonishing $1,560,000&lt;/a&gt; at Heritage Auctions on Sunday, smashing the record that had just been claimed by &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCdACD"&gt;Over the past 12 months, the record for the most expensive video game ever has risen dramatically. Here’s the timeline of the record, as far as I am aware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Wtexn0"&gt;July 10th, 2020: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. &lt;/em&gt;sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;$114,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GYSbMX"&gt;November 23rd, 2020: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 3 &lt;/em&gt;sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591120/super-mario-bros-3-record-breaking-auction-price-condition-sealed"&gt;$156,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9yZY8i"&gt;April 2nd, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364245/super-mario-bros-most-expensive-game-ever-record-sealed-auction"&gt;$660,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yZ5Bc9"&gt;July 9th, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;$870,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZCnXId"&gt;July 11th, 2021: copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; sells for &lt;a href="https://comics.ha.com/itm/video-games/super-mario-64-wata-98-a-sealed-n64-nintendo-1996-usa/a/7261-28137.s"&gt;$1,560,000&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zyzMSO"&gt;It’s not just video games that have skyrocketed. The value of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/pokemon-cards-worth-a-fortune-to-collectors-and-startups-alike"&gt;Pokémon cards has been on a tear, too&lt;/a&gt;, and eBay even announced a feature for its app to make it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370253/ebay-app-scan-pokemon-cards-sell-more-easily-listing"&gt;easier to scan trading cards&lt;/a&gt; to sell on the auction site. The prices of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt;, a form of digital collectibles, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/15/nft-price-crash-what-next-for-digital-collectibles.html"&gt;seems to be dropping, though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic successfully sends Richard Branson to the edge of space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-US-SPACE-TOURISM-BEZOS-BRANSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7RRCxceUN-0bVX4WUjoaAIFAVqs=/14x0:4486x2981/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567345/1233923045.16.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUbA24"&gt;Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson and a crew of Virgin Galactic employees nailed a clean touchdown in New Mexico on Sunday after launching to space aboard the company’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane. The mission, dubbed Unity 22, marked the fourth test flight to space for the vehicle and the first for Branson, the 70-year-old daredevil entrepreneur who’s been waiting over a decade for his debut trek to the edge of space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0wmrV"&gt;The SpaceShipTwo plane, dubbed VSS Unity, took off at 10:40AM ET attached to the belly of Virgin Galactic’s twin-fuselage WhiteKnight plane. Unity dropped from the center of the carrier craft at an altitude of around 45,000 feet roughly 50 minutes after takeoff. Moments later VSS Unity ignited its single rocket engine to blast to the edge of space, reaching 53.5 miles above the ground. The crew basked in a few moments of weightlessness before gliding back to land in New Mexico at Spaceport America, the central hub for Virgin Galactic’s nascent space tourism business.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G1EsfLv6TqhUCsFzdc0bx_LQQ3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711015/Screen_Shot_2021_07_11_at_11.25.45_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Virgin Galactic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The SpaceShipTwo rocket ignites&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="goTi7O"&gt;Branson shared congratulatory hand shakes with his fellow crew members as VSS Unity entered microgravity, later calling the flight “an experience of a lifetime,” as heard on plane’s choppy communications line to ground control. Once landed, Branson hopped out of VSS Unity and skipped toward a crowd of photographers, children, and relatives just outside Spaceport America. He could barely contain his excitement in a post-flight ceremony: “I was upside down a few minutes ago” he started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xlzrPO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the ship looked perfect”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOdpq5"&gt;“I think like most kids I have dreamt of this moment as a kid, but honestly nothing could prepare you for the view of Earth from space,” Branson said. Then, in full salesman mode, he called Virgin Galactic “the spaceline for Earth” and delivered on a promise to announce something “very exciting” after his flight: He &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572643/virgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space"&gt;revealed a partnership&lt;/a&gt; with fundraising company Omaze to give out two seats on VSS Unity, and — “with my Willy Wonka hat on,” he quipped — a personal tour of Spaceport America. “And I promise lots of chocolate in the factory,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cq52sh"&gt;Virgin Galactic president Mike Moses told reporters “the ship looked perfect” at touchdown, besides a possible antenna issue that caused a live video feed from inside the cabin to glitch during key moments of the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvIY52"&gt;Branson was “feeling good, feeling excited, feeling ready” ahead of his flight to space, riding a bike to the spaceport before sunrise, flanked by two white Range Rovers. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485?s=20"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he started the morning off with a visit from Elon Musk, who was in New Mexico to watch the mission in person. Onboard SpaceShipTwo with Branson were two pilots, Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, and three other crew members in the cabin: Chief Astronaut Instructor Beth Moses, Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett, and Vice President of Government Affairs and Research Operations Sirisha Bandla. The crew tested out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21340015/virgin-galactic-cabin-interior-unveil-passenger-seats-space-tourism"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s cabin experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XpB3xk"&gt;Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield awarded Branson and the crew gold-colored pins to inaugurate their new status to Virgin Galactic as commercial astronauts, having flown above the 50-mile-line deemed to be space by the Federal Aviation Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnQIFO"&gt;Branson’s flight was a golden opportunity to attract potential customers for Virgin Galactic’s space tourism business, so the atmosphere at Spaceport America on Sunday was full of marketing and theatrics. For attendees, the spaceport looked like a music festival, sitting next to the runway VMS Eve took off from. Dozens of guests watched the mission on a giant screen at the center of a stage set up just outside the main building of Spaceport America. Stephen Colbert hosted the mission’s livestream and singer-songwriter Khalid performed a new single on the stage. A fleet of Range Rovers towed VSS Unity back to Spaceport America after landing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="koEqC9"&gt;Space tourism ready for takeoff&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="683KFh"&gt;Virgin Galactic previously planned to fly Branson as a passenger on a later test flight, but earlier this month the company announced he’d be bumped up to fly on Unity 22 as a crew member instead. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;set Branson up to make it to space ahead of his rival Jeff Bezos&lt;/a&gt;, another billionaire who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522313/jeff-bezos-space-launch-brother-blue-origin-july-20"&gt;plans to fly&lt;/a&gt; his space company’s New Shepard rocket to the edge of space on July 20th. It’s a PR-heavy display of competition, but for Branson, who turns 71 on July 18th, it’s executing a decades-long dream to go to space. And for Virgin Galactic, flying its billionaire founder is seen as a show of confidence that SpaceShipTwo is safe for anyone to fly. In 2014, the company suffered a mid-flight disaster during a test flight that killed one pilot and severely injured another. After that flight, Branson &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-crisis-management-2014-11"&gt;vowed to travel&lt;/a&gt; on a future flight before the company started flying customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdyltS"&gt;The Unity 22 mission marks a key step forward for the company’s development of SpaceShipTwo as it tries to lead a burgeoning space tourism market catered to wealthy adventure-seekers. Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004 and has already sold roughly 600 tickets priced around $250,000 a pop, but it hasn’t flown any of those passengers yet. The company has two more test missions planned this year before kicking off its commercial space tourism business in 2022. But like any launch, that plan hinges on the outcome of Sunday’s test flight. Vehicle inspections and weeks of post-mission data reviews will inform how it plans to move forward, the company has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1gAJjd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Branson’s Virgin Galactic is competing with Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aP1OCY"&gt;Also vying for a slice of the space tourism market is Bezos’ Blue Origin — which hasn’t announced its ticket price point yet — and Musk’s SpaceX. Like Virgin’s SpaceShipTwo, Blue Origin’s crew vehicle is suborbital, though it’s a gumdrop-shaped capsule that launches vertically atop a 5-story-tall rocket and ascends to an altitude of 62 miles. Blue Origin’s July 20th flight with Bezos, the company’s first to fly humans, will include Bezos’ brother Mark, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558908/wally-funk-flight-jeff-bezos-blue-origin-space-new-shepard"&gt;aviation legend Wally Funk&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22530907/blue-origin-auction-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-space-28-million"&gt;undisclosed winner of a $28 million auction&lt;/a&gt; for a fourth seat. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;SpaceX’s space tourism plans&lt;/a&gt; are even more involved; its Crew Dragon capsule will launch to orbit for a few days for a price of roughly $55 million per seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47qnrw"&gt;The competitive space industry vibes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570287/space-tourism-virgin-galactic-branson-blue-origin-bezos"&gt;flared&lt;/a&gt; in the weeks leading up to Unity 22. Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521627116032001?s=20"&gt;threw shade&lt;/a&gt; at Virgin Galactic in a snarky tweet two days before Branson's flight, alleging Branson isn’t really reaching space because SpaceShipTwo flies a few miles below the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18130973/space-karman-line-definition-boundary-atmosphere-astronauts"&gt;boundary of space&lt;/a&gt; recognized by an international sports organization. Jeff Bezos had more positive vibes on Saturday, wishing Branson good luck in an Instagram post. Musk has been cordial throughout, keeping a distance from the PR war and meeting up with Branson in New Mexico. “Thanks for being so typically supportive and such a good friend, Elon,” Branson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1413886033330982915?s=20"&gt;tweeted to Musk&lt;/a&gt; on the eve of his flight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Virgin Galactic has opened a sweepstakes offering a trip to space</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Galactic’s spaceplane, the VSS Unity.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Omaze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8pSMpm"&gt;Virgin Galactic just successfully sent founder &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;Richard Branson to the edge of space and back&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company is offering a chance for you to take the trip in the company’s spaceplane as well. After Sunday’s flight, Branson announced that Virgin Galactic had partnered with fundraising platform Omaze to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaze.com%2Fproducts%2Fvirgin-galactic-2021%3Fref%3Dspace&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F11%2F22572643%2Fvirgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;open a sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt; that will send the winner and a friend on a spaceflight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ1UyN"&gt;The winner will take a trip on the VSS Unity spaceplane, the same plane Branson traveled on. You’ll also get a tour of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21035125/virgin-galactic-spaceport-america-truth-or-consequences-new-mexico"&gt;Spaceport America&lt;/a&gt; in New Mexico from Branson himself, “with my Willa Wonka hat on,” Branson said. (“And I promise lots of chocolate in the factory,” he joked.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HjkC5J"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-F4Q9cvpf8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOEru6"&gt;The sweepstakes is also a fundraiser for the nonprofit &lt;a href="https://spaceforhumanity.org/?locale=en"&gt;Space for Humanity&lt;/a&gt;, and the more you donate, the more entries you get (though the fine print says that the maximum amount of entries for one person is 6,000). You can also submit an entry without donating if you choose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjm0o9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.omaze.com%2Fproducts%2Fvirgin-galactic-2021%3Fref%3Dspace&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F11%2F22572643%2Fvirgin-galactic-omaze-sweepstakes-richard-branson-trip-to-space" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The sweepstakes&lt;/a&gt; closes on September 1st at 2:59AM ET, and the winner will be announced “around” September 29th, according to the website. Among other restrictions, you must be 18 years or older to enter, and the winner and their guest will have to prove that they’re vaccinated against COVID-19 to be eligible to win the sweepstakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QU8bZ"&gt;The “experience” is estimated to take place in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive TED chats are coming to Clubhouse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B--7o2xVQQdmzWWyTxShx1wEqDg=/0x4:2987x1995/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69567555/ted_logos.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: TED&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nxqVqF"&gt;Clubhouse has another partnership, and this time, it’s with one of the most popular podcast networks. The company announced today that it’s partnering with TED to bring exclusive chats to the social audio platform throughout the summer and beyond. The first room, called &lt;em&gt;Thank Your Ass Off&lt;/em&gt;, will start July 12th and run weekly at 11AM ET on Mondays. The company says additional rooms will launch soon, all going through TED’s Clubhouse club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nMwdVZ"&gt;Under the deal, TED is free to sell brand partnerships or ads, if it’s interested, and Clubhouse won’t take a cut, a spokesperson confirms. The partnership makes sense given that people often compare Clubhouse rooms to TED talks, essentially meaning people wax on about big ideas and often do so in the style of a conference presentation. The company is also already a major success in audio through its podcasting efforts, so it’s possible a form of these chats might be distributed outside the app as an RSS feed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qS5q7T"&gt;TED &lt;a href="https://blog.ted.com/ted-launches-ted-audio-collective-for-podcasts/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; its Audio Collective in February this year, and at the time, said its shows were downloaded 1.65 million times per day in “virtually every country on Earth.” Spotify &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2020-12-01/the-trends-that-shaped-streaming-in-2020/"&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;TED Talks Daily&lt;/em&gt; was the second most popular show globally on its platform in 2020. All of which is to say, TED knows how to do audio, people like listening to its programming, and Clubhouse can benefit from that buzz. On TED’s end, it can host regular Q&amp;amp;As and integrate audience interaction, which it can’t do through the usual podcast recording means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JJ48jc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The partnership doesn’t have an end date, Clubhouse says&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qjYYRF"&gt;Increasingly, it seems like the winners in social audio might come down to whoever can lock down talent. Presumably, Spotify will encourage its podcasters to use Greenroom, its Clubhouse competitor, while Facebook has planned to work with Bobby Berk, Tina Knowles-Lawson, and Joe Budden, among others, for its Live Audio Rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJtAS3"&gt;Twitter and the NFL &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568434/nfl-twitter-spaces-partnership-2021-season"&gt;announced this past week&lt;/a&gt; that the league would create “exclusive content” for Twitter Spaces, its live audio platform. Clubhouse previously &lt;a href="https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/clubhouse-announces-exclusive-content-deal-with-nfl-its-first-official-spo/599005/"&gt;hosted&lt;/a&gt; exclusive NFL chats during Draft Week, and a spokesperson confirms that despite this Twitter deal, Clubhouse is still working with the NFL on future programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9H24jk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 11th, 12:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect confirmation from Clubhouse’s spokesperson about its NFL deal and future plans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
