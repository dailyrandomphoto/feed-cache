    <title>Samsung’s latest Galaxy Chromebook is $100 off for the first time</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F0ZPFo"&gt;Samsung’s latest Chrome OS laptop, the Galaxy Chromebook 2, came out a couple of months ago. If you are looking to buy this laptop at a more affordable price, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737191485644991413#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737196912936872712#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; have multiple configurations on sale for $100 off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7VdNv"&gt;My colleague, Monica Chin, thinks this laptop is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the best midrange Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now and notes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in her review&lt;/a&gt; that this Chromebook has much better battery life than its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MyIhdu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10435503"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KrDsUI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima &lt;/em&gt;was released last year, and it quickly became one of the more popular games in 2020, so much so that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the game is getting a film adaption&lt;/a&gt;. If you have yet to experience this open-world action title, it is back down to its lowest price yet of $40 at several retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghost-Tsushima-PlayStation-4/dp/B08BSKT43L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724325625436134758#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedeals&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fghost-of-tsushima%2F11100913.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3Kw9G4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JOTrEj"&gt;At a sale price of $297, LG’s UltraGear, a 27-inch gaming monitor, is a great deal. It’s been discounted since earlier this week, but the deal is still available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LLD2QXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1621994-REG%2Flg_27gn800_b_27_qhd_ips_hdr10.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F8%2F22373433%2Fsamsung-galaxy-chromebook-ghost-of-tsushima-lg-monitor-sale-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. If you managed to get your hands on the latest AMD or Nvidia GPU, or are an early adopter of the Xbox Series X, this 1440p monitor is a good option to consider.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD revamps its midrange Nokia lineup with six phones under €350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TfUuWYki-4j9QODKpaIA2ZsTins=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095144/Group_shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, HMD’s Nokia G10, X20, C10, X10, G20, and C20.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; HMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="03e2Sm"&gt;HMD is announcing six new midrange Nokia phones today, ranging in price from €75 (around $90) up to €349 (around $415). At the top, there’s the X-series, consisting of the X10 and X20, followed by the G-series G10 and G20, and then finally, there’s the entry-level C10 and C20 from the C-series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I7T55e"&gt;HMD’s pitch for these phones is the length of time it’s offering support, with even the cheapest C-series phones due to receive two years of quarterly security updates. Meanwhile G-series phones will receive two years of Android OS updates, and three years of monthly security updates. Finally, the X-series gets three years of OS updates, three years of monthly security updates, and an extended warranty that HMD says should mean it’s covered for three years in many of its release markets.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i4QG5b2wdm-BpCt6Bk-ICtsEKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429117/Nokia_X20___Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="921Yx8"&gt;At the top of the six-phone lineup is the X20, which HMD says will be priced at the equivalent of €349 (£299.99, around $415) around the world. It’s got a 6.67-inch 1080p display, with a hole-punch cutout in the top-center for its 32-megapixel selfie camera, while on the back you’ll find a circular camera bump containing four cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth camera, and a 2-megapixel macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI8iFq"&gt;Internally, the X20 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 and 4,470 mAh battery, with either 6 or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage. It runs Android 11 out of the box, and includes three years of OS updates that HMD says will take it through to Android 14. Security is handled by a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and there’s also a dedicated Google Assistant button on the left. I’ve been using the Nokia X20 for the past week, and you can read my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22136485"&gt;firsthand impressions here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZN_FrgzIUmyI-ULFs3gjo_Vwnn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429118/Nokia_X10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia X10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25RTi5"&gt;A step down from the X20 is the Nokia X10 at €309 (£249.99, around $367). It shares a lot of the DNA of its older sibling. It’s also running on a Snapdragon 480, with a 4,470 mAh battery, and has a 6.67-inch 1080p display. But it’s available with slightly lower specs: a minimum of 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and its main camera and selfie camera at  lower resolutions of 48-megapixels and 8-megapixels, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mg0pVe"&gt;Next is the G-series, which is led by the Nokia G20 at €159 (£129.99, around $189). Its screen is a little smaller at 6.5 inches and has a lower resolution of 720p. Internally, it’s using a Mediatek G35 processor with a 5,050 mAH battery, upwards of 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of expandable storage. You still get four rear cameras though: a 48-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Around front there’s a notch containing an 8-megapixel camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UlZShG1gTCbSJiedbuM23DHBuk8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429123/Nokia_G10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57_ftm-V7sKRfvQKo668yjNFGhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429124/Nokia_G20_Emotional.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HMD&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia G20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gUeNod"&gt;The G20 is joined by the Nokia G10 at €139 (£109.99, around $165). Its display and battery have the same specs as the G20, but it’s got a less powerful Mediatek G25 processor, with 3 or 4GB of RAM and 32 or 64GB of expandable storage. Around back you only get three cameras: a 13-megapixel main camera, a 2-megapixel macro, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The Nokia G10 has an 8-megapixel selfie camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKf1qp"&gt;Right at the bottom of the newly revamped lineup is the C-series, which HMD says is designed for people who would previously have bought non-smart feature phones. Both the Nokia C20 at €89 (£79, around $105) and the Nokia C10 at €75 (around $90) have 6.5-inch 720p displays, a single rear 5-megapixel camera, a 5-megapixel selfie camera, and are running Google’s lightweight Go edition of Android 11. The C20 has a Unisoc SC9863a processor while the C10 has a Unisoc SC7331e processor. Both are available with 1 or 2GB of RAM, 16 or 32GB of expandable storage, and removable 3,000 mAh batteries that charge over microUSB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsZROFnknRgHXwkY76IZ9qseG0s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429129/Nokia_C10_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia C10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HYGuE3Vwc6KTOyeIzDcwjBUU8O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429130/Nokia_C20_Emotional.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HMD Nokia C20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OT0jah"&gt;The naming schemes may be different than previous Nokia lines, but with its six new devices HMD is focusing on its traditional strengths: affordable phones with lengthy support periods. We’re still waiting for HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability for the handsets, but the G10 and C20 will be available in “select markets” starting later this month, the X20 and G20 will launch in May, and the X10 and C10 will launch in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HMD’s Nokia X20 is designed to actually last you three years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8TIyLZPb0k1gEDAcsdC0s1pg-c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095135/jporter_20210407_4514_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tnVjBV"&gt;HMD is announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22135978"&gt;six new midrange devices&lt;/a&gt; today led by the Nokia X20, a midrange handset priced starting at €349 / £299.99 (around $415). It will release in “select markets globally” such as the UK starting next month, but we’re still waiting on HMD to confirm exact US pricing and availability. I’ve been using the phone running near-final software over the past week, which has been enough to get some rough first impressions about the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OpF5tO"&gt;To be frank, the Nokia X20 isn’t the most exciting device. But HMD’s promises about ongoing software and hardware support for the phone make it compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5dVoD"&gt;The Nokia X20 is specced like a device at this price point is expected to be. It’s powered by a modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor paired with either 6 or 8GB of RAM (my device has 6GB), 128GB of expandable storage, and a 4,470mAh battery. It’s got a 6.67-inch, 1080p 60Hz display with a small hole-punch notch and four rear cameras including an ultrawide, macro, and depth sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WO-rk1GA-8LMPrS7IfPH5DchXFs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427482/jporter_20210407_4514_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor on the right of the device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUXX35"&gt;The company says it’ll provide three years of monthly security updates for the X20 after launch, three years of OS updates, and to ensure the hardware doesn’t give up the ghost before software support ends, it’s also extending its normal manufacturer’s warranty by an extra year. “In the majority of places,” a company spokesperson says, “that extends it to three years.” If all goes to plan, the Nokia X20 should still be under warranty when it receives its Android 14 update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdIGRz"&gt;In the past, HMD has generally been good at updating its phones over time, though &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3606708/android-11-upgrade-report-card.html?page=2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ComputerWorld&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Android 11 upgrade tracker&lt;/a&gt; reports that it’s been more sluggish lately. Recently, HMD updated its &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/hmd-global-rolls-out-android-11-nokia-8-1-nokia-2-3/"&gt;Nokia 8.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/24/android-11-is-now-rolling-out-to-the-nokia-3-2/"&gt;Nokia 3.2&lt;/a&gt;, which released in 2018 and 2019, to Android 11 as part of an upgrade roadmap that includes &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/nokia-android-11-update-roadmap-hmd-global-1162501/"&gt;over a dozen of its devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFzgb4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It should eventually be updated to Android 14&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="amXhOz"&gt;Three years of security updates is a little less than the four years Samsung recently said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;would offer for its Galaxy devices&lt;/a&gt;, but Samsung’s warranty varies between one and two years depending on whether you’re in the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/uk/support/warranty/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;. Apple recently updated its 2015 iPhone 6S to iOS 14 (five years after its release), but its standard limited warranty also typically only covers new phones for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Flegal%2Fwarranty%2Fstatutoryrights.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F8%2F22372444%2Fhmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;between one and two years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHU6nh"&gt;Along with aiming for three years of use, HMD has also made a couple of other decisions with the Nokia X20 in the name of being eco-friendly. First, in the EU it’s joining Apple and others by not including a power brick in the box, just a USB-C cable. What you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; get in the box is a 100 percent compostable phone case. It’s a neat idea producing a case that won’t end up in a landfill, but the accessory itself is frustrating to use. The portion of the case that covers the phone’s volume rocker just isn’t flexible enough, making it hard to press the side of the button that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aPWMwnSFG9cUNm5sXY4mkVFu444=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427481/jporter_20210407_4514_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Four cameras can be found on the rear of the phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2jiC5QQ2yPQebKxAj8Ouwryx7sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429447/jporter_20210407_4514_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X20’s compostable case can get in the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ocu1RH"&gt;The speed and performance of the phone was generally fine, but I saw the occasional hitch while switching quickly between apps, which made me question how this phone will perform after three years of OS updates. Otherwise, I didn’t have any problems with performance in everyday usage. The X20 supports Sub-6GHz 5G, which won’t matter much to you now but could in three years’ time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEqPvf"&gt;You can find a selection of photo samples below, but in my time with the phone I was underwhelmed by the Nokia X20’s camera performance. The phone has a total of four rear cameras: a 64-megapixel main camera, a 5-megapixel ultrawide, a 2-megapixel depth sensor, and a 2-megapixel macro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iNN54U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10434509"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KPiu28"&gt;Performance in daylight is broadly fine, but when things are more dimly lit you quickly start to lose detail and definition. Neither the ultrawide camera nor the macro camera have the resolution to take decent photographs, and the 2-megapixel macro camera in particular is a pointless and puzzling inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1BPaJ"&gt;HMD’s Nokia X20 can’t make any big claims about being a flagship hit, but its modest price tag and HMD’s promises about continued support could make it a safe, dependable smartphone if that’s what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Could a ‘Crypto Climate Accord’ erase cryptocurrencies’ carbon footprint?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bitcoin Mining at Russian CryptoUniverse Farm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0Q8Qh4pgSVW7VZwDrC2WYzUTVg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69095094/1231874962.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bitcoin Mining at Russian CryptoUniverse Farm | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/search/photographer?family=editorial&amp;amp;photographer=Bloomberg" target="_blank"&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;Contributor via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1dyyy"&gt;A newly announced “&lt;a href="https://cryptoclimate.org/"&gt;Crypto Climate Accord&lt;/a&gt;” aims to erase cryptocurrencies’ legacy of climate pollution. That’s a tall order considering the enormous amounts of energy that the most popular cryptocurrencies — bitcoin and Ethereum — consume. The loose goals laid out in the plan so far face potentially insurmountable challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UYwtQR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A 2040 target for the crypto industry to reach “net zero” emissions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bYqRNd"&gt;The “accord” is led by the private sector — not governments — and outlines a few preliminary objectives. It seeks to transition all blockchains to renewable energy by 2030 or sooner. It sets a 2040 target for the crypto industry to reach “net zero” emissions, which would involve reducing pollution and turning to strategies that might be able to suck the industry’s historical carbon dioxide emissions out of the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pA3rq4"&gt;Lastly and perhaps most realistically, it aims to develop an open-source accounting standard that can be used to consistently measure emissions generated by the crypto industry. They also want to develop software that can verify how much renewable energy a blockchain uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mHSVD6"&gt;If achieved, those goals would solve a very real problem. Bitcoin alone has roughly the same &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;carbon footprint&lt;/a&gt; annually as Hong Kong, while &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption"&gt;Ethereum’s annual carbon emissions&lt;/a&gt; rival Lithuania’s. Their climate pollution is growing even as scientists’ research warns that global emissions need to be cut almost in half this decade to avoid the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NINzFu"&gt;The accord has support from some influential names in climate action and the crypto industry — including cryptocurrency company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196064/ripple-sec-cryptocurrency-security-currency-xrp"&gt;Ripple&lt;/a&gt;, blockchain technology conglomerate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/20/18150036/consensys-layoffs-employees-pending-startup-ethereum"&gt;Consensys&lt;/a&gt;, billionaire climate crusader &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21030422/tom-steyer-fossil-fuels-2020-democratic-debate-candidate-billionaire"&gt;Tom Steyer&lt;/a&gt;, and the United Nations-appointed “&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/climate-action/marrakech-partnership/actors/meet-the-champions"&gt;climate champions&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwkCED"&gt;While tackling the environmental damage done by the crypto industry might be a worthy challenge, critics say the broad goals are unlikely to result in meaningful change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxHSGD"&gt;“Some things just can’t be fixed,” says economist Alex de Vries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="u8GCVz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Some things just can’t be fixed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ghkaIx"&gt;Unfortunately for the Crypto Climate Accord, bitcoin is the biggest player in the game, and it’s likely to cause the accord the most trouble because of how much energy it uses. Bitcoin is purposely inefficient — which is a problem renewables can’t fix. It uses a model called “proof of work” to keep its ledgers secure. “Miners” who verify transactions to get new coins do so by using energy-guzzling machines to solve increasingly difficult puzzles. (Ethereum also uses proof of work but has said for years that it will eventually transition to another model.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="syPL3R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The climate controversy swirling around NFTs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0NOgGG"&gt;Those machines will continue to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S254243511930087X"&gt;compete for renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; with arguably more essential needs, like keeping the power on in people’s homes. And if cryptocurrencies increase electricity demand beyond available renewable resources, utilities might turn to fossil fuels. That’s why cleaning up energy sources &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; increasing energy efficiency are two sides of the same coin when it comes to tackling climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwX6e2"&gt;Regardless, the accord’s founders are optimistic about a greener future for bitcoin. “I’ve been in conversation with folks from the bitcoin ecosystem, it’s a pretty simple pitch,” says Jesse Morris, chief commercial officer of the nonprofit Energy Web Foundation, which is spearheading the initiative. “If we can make bitcoin green, it will be much easier and lower risk for other organizations to come in and buy more Bitcoin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1s6Pu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If we can make bitcoin green, it will be much easier and lower risk for other organizations to come in and buy more bitcoin.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yj0BVI"&gt;Bitcoin still accounts for &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/06/cryptocurrency-market-cap-tops-2-trillion-for-the-first-time.html"&gt;more than half&lt;/a&gt; of the entire cryptocurrency market capitalization. But it is facing competition from newer cryptocurrencies that have found ways to be greener. Other cryptocurrencies use different blockchain technology than bitcoin and consume very little energy in comparison as a result. For those cryptocurrencies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203761/coinbase-halts-trading-xrp-ripple-sec-suit"&gt;Ripple’s XRP&lt;/a&gt;, running on renewables could be more feasible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3mRUF"&gt;And while renewable energy costs have fallen dramatically, luring bitcoin miners to places with abundant renewable energy would likely require heavy subsidies to keep them from turning to cheaper, dirtier fuel sources, de Vries says. “Just the sound of that — It sounds really wrong,” he says. “Why would you want to subsidize an industry that uses energy just because it is set up to waste resources?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zCtLU"&gt;The new crypto accord, however, is “not about coming together and asking for subsidy by any means,” says Morris. “We just want to get everybody together and start nailing the action here.” Many blockchains, like bitcoin, were designed to be a decentralized system with no top-down oversight. So getting everyone on board, even within a single blockchain, will be a huge task. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Km7G"&gt;The accord’s objectives are supposed to be fleshed out and finalized by the time a big United Nations climate conference rolls around in November. But Morris admits that the initial plans chase big aspirations rather than fine details. “So many of these other decarbonization efforts are very much thinking their way into acting,” Morris says. “Whereas in Crypto, because it’s kind of the Wild West, it’s about acting our way into new thinking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eE1JfA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y2tmgv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Stack is a clever, if incomplete, way to digitize and organize documents</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ywVR9crm5VpQlegQK898DzCFL5o=/107x0:1292x790/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69094834/Screen_Shot_2021_03_30_at_9.01.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFlbaC"&gt;Having to deal with paperwork is a real pain, whether it’s hardcopy or digital. Tax documents, explanations of benefits from insurance companies, purchase receipts, prescriptions, bills, vaccination cards — the list of daily paperwork goes on and on. And of course, when you suddenly need to find that receipt for your two-year-old laptop, it’s nowhere to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkbTTF"&gt;Google’s latest experimental app, &lt;a href="https://stack.area120.com/"&gt;Stack&lt;/a&gt;, is meant to help make that part of your life easier. A product of Google’s Area 120 incubator, Stack is designed to be &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; place where you can keep PDF copies of all those documents. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358088/google-stack-ai-document-scanner-app-android-release-announce"&gt;mentioned in our initial article&lt;/a&gt;, Stack borrows the technology underlying Google’s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/document-ai"&gt;powerful DocAI enterprise tool&lt;/a&gt; for document analysis so it can organize them into categories — or, in Google-speak, stacks — and allow you to search for words within the text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNiCZD"&gt;I have a lot of papers to keep organized. To keep their digital copies stored and accessible, I use a combination of Google Drive, Evernote, and a &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appxy.tinyscanner&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;PDF-creating app called Tiny Scanner&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not an ideal solution, so when Google came out with a document scanning / organizing app, I thought I’d see what this Stack was all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MVoP4M"&gt;Bring in the Stacks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IidSYa"&gt;First, a note: currently, Stack is only available on Android devices and can only be installed using a personal Gmail account, not a Google Workplace (formerly called G Suite) account. However, once you install the app, you can access documents saved on any of your Google Drive accounts, including Workspace accounts. This kind of confusion won’t be new to anyone who has to deal with juggling multiple Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfcoZc"&gt;When you first open Stack, you are presented with a series of icons representing a variety of stacks, including Bills, Banking, House, IDs, Medical, Receipts, and Starred. If none of those suit your needs, you can click on an Edit link at the top right, and you are shown other stacks having to do with taxes, immigration, vehicles, and other categories, which you can add to your top-level stacks. You can also create your own stack by tapping on a plus button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You organize your documents into stacks." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TQKeg93Wy7Osym9oOemY8OVxp2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427840/stacka.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You organize your documents into stacks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can select different stacks, or create your own." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pioco_nNhUPgEfiVOZbBkWoTtXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427839/stacke.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select different stacks or create your own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7BYiRp"&gt;At the bottom of the main screen are two tabs: “Home” (the initial screen where you can see your stacks) and “All documents” (where you can see and search on all your saved documents without the “stack” organization).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xV9k8"&gt;To start adding documents, you press the plus symbol on the home screen. You are presented with three ways to populate Stack:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="2zrtXH"&gt;PDF: pull in an existing PDF from any Google Drive account or from your device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8LcuWV"&gt;Gallery: find a recently photographed image on your device &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hAidLo"&gt;Camera: use your device’s camera to scan a document&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="PXFoYu"&gt;I’ve got a lot of documents sitting in Google Drive, so I thought I’d start by using the PDF method to import documents. I was disappointed to find that I could only import one document at a time — which means it would take me a very long time to bring in my entire history of PDFs.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTvPy3"&gt;The Gallery method was also not especially useful since it only gave me access to about a month and a half of the photos on my device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can add an existing PDF or scan one using your phone’s camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vsz5_saiwmNuHU_YImHkjfA22IA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427843/stackf__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add an existing PDF or scan one using your phone’s camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There are basic edit features for the PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1tZ5hfm4GQi5gcZfhGN77FgYpk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427857/stack_preview_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are basic edit features for the PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KE6V6E"&gt;On the other hand, using my phone’s camera to scan a document from within Stack worked nicely. The document is previewed before saving and you can adjust the color, crop it, and rotate it, if necessary. You can also add additional pages, so that you can have a document of more than one page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6lZaM"&gt;Whichever way I imported a document, I was impressed with how well Stack incorporated it. The app creates the name of the document from its content, isolates important details such as date and amount of purchase, and uses the content to decide which stack it should go in. For example, it correctly identified a document that had information about the &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;CDC’s v-safe app&lt;/a&gt; as being from the CDC and placed it in the Medical stack. And when I photographed a very crumpled store receipt, it picked out the retailer’s name and the amount of the purchase without any perceivable difficulty and put the document in my Receipts stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84v6Sm"&gt;You don’t have to depend on the app to decide which stack the document goes in. You can assign a document to a stack by going to the “All documents” tab and then selecting the document in question; its stacks are listed below the image, and you can add or remove them there. And yes, you can assign a single document to more than one stack, if you want — for example, I put the CDC document in both my Medical and Starred stacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltb8cn"&gt;What you can’t do is create sub-stacks (or sub-folders) within a stack. You can’t tag a document, either. So, for example, if you’re collecting a lot of medical documents from different doctors, you have to put them all in the Medical stack and do a search for the document you need or create a separate stack for each doctor. Hopefully, as this experimental app is worked on, some additional organizational tools will be added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rt38Fi"&gt;On the other hand, doing a search (by going to “All documents”) will usually find what you need. As could be expected from a Google app, the search works very well; most of my searches were successful in finding text within the PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Stack’s AI pulled out data even from a crumpled receipt." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kllF5xUnYw0biW6nFvpScyGvFbs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427968/stack_harde.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stack’s AI pulled out data even from a crumpled receipt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can search for content from within the PDF." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7aI4kUun2cHwdbvnOokFAPtFYyM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427859/stack_search.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can search for content from within the PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K14UHE"&gt;If you go to the Settings page (which is accessible from your personal icon), you can have the app automatically import any photos of documents that you take with your device. You can also automatically save all your PDFs to your Google Drive (which is an excellent idea since Stack is experimental and could very easily end up in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;Google Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;). And if you decide Stack isn’t for you, then you can export all existing documents to your Drive and delete all your data from Stack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IbdMnK"&gt;Privacy and security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="N4SZul"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/area-120/stack/"&gt;Google’s description of the app&lt;/a&gt;, “Stack uses Google’s advanced security and sign-in technology to protect your documents.” You can also require a face or fingerprint lock to access the app — a good idea if you’re planning to include any sensitive documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugSOr1"&gt;How much that protects your documents from Google itself is, as always, up for question. In order to use Stack, you are agreeing to Google’s Terms of Service (which you’ve probably agreed to before anyway, if you have a Gmail account) and Privacy Policy (same). You are also asked to allow the app to access photos and media on your device and to take pictures and record video (while using the app, only this time, or deny). Both of these permissions are optional, but if Stack can’t access media or take photos, it probably won’t be very useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKTdc1"&gt;So is Stack a viable option for those of us who are trying to track life’s paperwork? As far as I’m concerned, it’s not quite there yet — because it’s so early in its development and because I’ve become a little cynical about Google’s tendency to abandon its experiments, I’m not ready to trust all my important papers to Stack. But it has a lot of potential, and I’m going to keep an eye on it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag Plus with UWB to track items with AR is out April 16th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w8-yziuN4Nal6fC11JRW78IfTck=/0x150:4059x2856/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69094508/smarttag.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AS5ijE"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag Plus, the souped-up version of the company’s Tile-like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;SmartTag Bluetooth tracker&lt;/a&gt; (which was released earlier this year), now has a release date: it’ll be out on April 16th for $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="293q1e"&gt;That’s a $10 price increase over the standard SmartTag, which runs for $29.99 — but the SmartTag Plus has one notable improvement. It features an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio, allowing users to track it more accurately when it’s nearby than the standard Bluetooth setup. The UWB radio actually enables a new AR mode, which can help show users exactly where their missing tag is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpnwMp"&gt;To use the new UWB mode, you’ll need both a Galaxy SmartTag Plus and a compatible UWB-equipped Galaxy phone, a list that currently includes the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, Galaxy S21 Ultra, and the Galaxy Z Fold 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yj1xgDJDI0MEeK9TSUWka4BpYE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429230/tag3.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YGIQo6"&gt;Aside from the fancy new UWB features, though, the SmartTag Plus still works just like the regular SmartTag, leveraging Samsung’s vast Bluetooth network of Galaxy devices to help track missing objects. It’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s Find My network&lt;/a&gt;, which uses iPhones and iPads to create a Bluetooth network (and, thanks to a recent expansion to third-party devices, will soon offer a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372099/chipolo-one-spot-bluetooth-tracker-find-my-apple-airtags"&gt;Find My-compatible tracker&lt;/a&gt; from Chipolo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnjMz1"&gt;The upcoming release of the Galaxy SmartTag Plus means that Samsung — and not Apple’s long-rumored AirTags — will be the first major AR-compatible UWB tracking accessory to hit the market. Apple has been reportedly working on a similar UWB-based AR feature for its upcoming tracker, but despite plenty of leaks and rumors, there’s still no word on a release date. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s Legion Phone Duel 2 has not one but two cooling fans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eCgiDQdx5Py5IpGiidokgQvcGn4=/0x0:1080x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69094270/lenovo_legion_phone_duel_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ji6bWJ"&gt;Lenovo’s next gaming phone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/6/22370308/lenovo-phone-2-pro-release-date-price-design-leaked"&gt;leaked earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, but now the company is officially sharing details about the new device, called the Legion Phone Duel 2. It’s a beast in every way — with a 6.92-inch screen, this is a gigantic phone that houses &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; batteries, &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; USB-C ports, and &lt;em&gt;two &lt;/em&gt;actual spinning fans, as well as a camera bump that makes us slightly regret we already used the “that’s no moon; it’s a space station” joke on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356660/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-camera-bump"&gt;Xiaomi Mi 11 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv3TPm"&gt;Some of its features are carryovers from Lenovo’s original Android gaming phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333138/lenovo-legion-duel-pro-gaming-phone-pop-up-selfie-cam-side-landscape"&gt;the Legion Phone Duel&lt;/a&gt;, including the twin USB-C ports and a pop-up selfie camera designed for streamers. Like the original Duel, Lenovo also maintains the unusual choice of centering the phone’s other two cameras around back, but now that raised camera bump houses a prominent intake fan and a hidden exhaust fan, each with their own vents. Lenovo says the split design keeps the heat away from your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6WgpII"&gt;Those fans, alongside a vapor chamber, help the Duel 2 funnel cool air to and from the new Snapdragon 888 processor, up to 18GB of LPDDR5 RAM, and up to 512GB of UFS3.1 storage. It runs on Lenovo’s ZUI 12.5, which the company says is based on Android 11.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJvi2bKdV6QRnRR1CLYAVt1Txs4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428366/Lenovo_Legion_Phone_Duel_2_Ultimate_Black_04.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Legion Phone Duel 2’s new fan-centered design in black.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UI9mkV2q_wqcROlQ7911jjpS7p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428540/Lenovo_Legion_Phone_Duel_2_Titanium_White_11.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera / fan bump is definitely noticeable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J7Qp13"&gt;The Duel 2 comes in either “Titanium White” or “Ultimate Black”, but really it’s the camera bump, Legion logo, and fan hole that make the Duel 2 look like nothing else on the market — except, perhaps, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; with its unusual rear screen and optional fan attachment snapped on. Lenovo doesn’t mention in its announcement whether the Dual 2’s colorful back design is lit with a customizable light, but even without the glow, it seems ready to take up space on someone’s desk alongside a RGB-lit gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1VKcNn"&gt;On the front, the Duel 2 features a 2,460 x 1,080 144Hz high-refresh rate OLED display with 800 nits of brightness (1300 nits at maximum), which should be more than bright enough for outdoor play. It’s also physically larger than its predecessor at 6.92 inches, up from a 6.65-inch display. Viewing the screen in landscape, the Duel 2’s pop-up 44-megapixel selfie camera (up from 20 megapixels) can be used for live streaming or video chats, just like the original Duel, with background removal. There’s still a 64-megapixel main camera around back, as well as a 16-megapixel ultrawide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxSmWv"&gt;The Dual’s two USB-C ports — one on the long side of the phone and one on the bottom — can be used for 90W fast charging if you buy an optional adapter, and Lenovo claims using them simultaneously can fill the phone’s two separate 2,750 mAh batteries in 30 minutes. Using two cables to charge a phone at once is sort of a funny image, but those kinds of considerations go out the window when you buy a Legion Phone Duel 2. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p8mVHurFsOwb9oxEHviPPR9-wIA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428330/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_4.17.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing unusual about this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWG9I"&gt;Lenovo says a full charge should give you “up to 8 hours” of “intermittent gameplay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tLKXd"&gt;The Duel 2 comes with 5G connectivity, in this case with support for both sub-6GHz and mmWave spectrum, theoretically in service of faster video and game streaming, and supports dual-SIM for two connections at once. To recreate some of the experience of using a controller while you play, the Duel 2 also features four “shoulder” buttons enabled through haptic feedback and ultrasonic sensors on the sides of the phone, two capacitive touch points on the back, and two force touch points in the display. (Haptics are provided by a pair of linear motors, another place where Lenovo decided one was insufficient.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzmjfS"&gt;There are even more specs to pour over, so if you’d like the full picture we’d recommend digging into Lenovo’s spec sheet:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_4abnxdixEJrrhbZwU-PSaSPJhg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22428495/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oefLLR"&gt;As a whole package, the Duel 2 shares more than a few similarities with its competitors. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;The Asus ROG 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; also has multiple USB-C ports, a unique method for simulating extra button inputs, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor, and an optional clip-on cooling fan. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; has even fancier magnetically lifting physical buttons and an optional fan accessory as well. And some gaming phones have had built-in fans in the past: look no further than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522625/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-release-date-cooling-price-specs-features"&gt;the Nubia Red Magic 3&lt;/a&gt; for a device with extra cooling from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34wGao"&gt;As with many gaming phones, the important question may be availability. Currently, Lenovo plans to release the Lenovo Legion Phone Duel 2 in China this month, and it should come to Europe later in May. The European model will retail for €999 (around $1,186) with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage and a bundled charging dock, or €799 (around $948) as a standalone phone with 12GB and 256GB respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oh4ifp"&gt;Lenovo hasn’t yet announced if the Duel 2 will come to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpThIE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Km6ebQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned about Intel’s AI sliders that filter online gaming abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Srsk3mJEKw11WHCsEEE8eqtpxpc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093965/msedge_ophDP9qyMx.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FUFOLe"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644"&gt;during its virtual GDC presentation&lt;/a&gt; Intel announced &lt;a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/bleep#about-section"&gt;Bleep&lt;/a&gt;, a new AI-powered tool that it hopes will cut down on the amount of toxicity gamers have to experience in voice chat. According to Intel, the app “uses AI to detect and redact audio based on user preferences.” The filter works on incoming audio, acting as an additional user-controlled layer of moderation on top of what a platform or service already offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEHhCk"&gt;It’s a noble effort, but there’s something bleakly funny about Bleep’s interface, which lists in minute detail all of the different categories of abuse that people might encounter online, paired with sliders to control the quantity of mistreatment users want to hear. Categories range anywhere from “Aggression” to “LGBTQ+ Hate,” “Misogyny,” “Racism and Xenophobia,” and “White nationalism.” There’s even a toggle for the N-word. &lt;a href="https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/bleep#about-section"&gt;Bleep’s page&lt;/a&gt; notes that it’s yet to enter public beta, so all of this is subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YhER0lJ2LKfbpFL5SSF9BeDj5Fw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429051/msedge_ophDP9qyMx.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Credit: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filters include “Aggression,” “Misogyny” ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wHopaekTjH1DkWP6EekTltegSRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22429058/msedge_oBvZK8eSRw.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://youtu.be/97Qhj299zRM?t=1644" target="_blank"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... and a toggle for the “N-word.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8E9euJ"&gt;With the majority of these categories, Bleep appears to give users a choice: would you like none, some, most, or all of this offensive language to be filtered out? Like choosing from a buffet of toxic internet slurry, Intel’s interface gives players the option of sprinkling in a light serving of aggression or name-calling into their online gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnFT2p"&gt;Bleep has been in the works for a couple of years now — &lt;a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/old-news/120177/intel-levels-up-ai-to-battle-toxicity-in-online-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Intel talked about this initiative way back at GDC 2019 — and it’s working with AI moderation specialists &lt;a href="https://www.spiritai.com/"&gt;Spirit AI&lt;/a&gt; on the software. But moderating online spaces using artificial intelligence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/27/18242724/facebook-moderation-ai-artificial-intelligence-platforms"&gt;is no easy feat&lt;/a&gt; as platforms like Facebook and YouTube have shown. Although automated systems can identify straightforwardly offensive words, they often fail to consider the context and nuance of certain insults and threats. Online toxicity comes in many, constantly evolving forms that can be difficult for even the most advanced AI moderation systems to spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bB9Y78"&gt;“While we recognize that solutions like Bleep don’t erase the problem, we believe it’s a step in the right direction, giving gamers a tool to control their experience,” Intel’s Roger Chandler said during its GDC demonstration. Intel says it hopes to release Bleep later this year, and adds that the technology relies on its hardware accelerated AI speech detection, suggesting that the software may rely on Intel hardware to run. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook hopes tiny labels on posts will stop users confusing satire with reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsvt337l-lvq2ewNU4Okrs8dI2w=/0x107:3800x2640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093953/facebook_satire_pages.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satire pages will now be labelled as such, along with public officials, fan pages, and government news outlets. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LQzkML"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1379887135998763014?s=20"&gt;adding&lt;/a&gt; additional labels to posts from Pages that appear in users’ News Feeds in a bid to reduce confusion about their origin. These labels will include “public official,” “fan page,” and “satire page.” The company says it’s already started testing the deployment of these labels in the US, and will gradually add them to more posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etyjIU"&gt;Facebook hasn’t offered any explanation as to why it’s adding these labels, but identifying satire seems particularly important. Take a look at the social shares for any news articles written by well-known satirical sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Babylon Bee&lt;/em&gt; and you’ll find plenty of people taking these stories at face value. In such a context these posts are essentially a type of misinformation, even if their creators did not intend this. Even high profile figures like former president Donald Trump have &lt;a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/10/16/donald-trump-tweets-babylon-bees-satirical-news-story-joe-biden/3676071001/"&gt;mistaken these stories&lt;/a&gt; for real reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RGADcf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today in the US, we’re testing a way to give people more context about the Pages they see. We’ll gradually start applying labels including 'public official,' 'fan page' or 'satire page' to posts in News Feed, so people can better understand who they’re coming from. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Bloc3b2ycb"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Bloc3b2ycb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1379887135998763014?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YLFAzJ"&gt;This isn’t the first time the social network giant has tried to make the context of posts in the News Feed clearer. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280542/facebook-state-controlled-media-account-post-label-election-interference-ads-rt"&gt;June last year&lt;/a&gt; it began labeling media outlets which are “wholly or partially under the editorial control of their government.” Such outlets need labels, argued Facebook, because “they combine the influence of a media organization with the strategic backing of a state, and we believe people should know if the news they read is coming from a publication that may be under the influence of a government.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Global chip shortage hits iPad and MacBook production, says report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-mmOHzE302gzu7oYjA3qcwZvYk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69093923/DSC01948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LWGPCr"&gt;Apple has not been spared the effects of the ongoing global component shortage, according to a &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/MacBook-and-iPad-production-delayed-as-supply-crunch-hits-Apple"&gt;new report in &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The publication says that some production of MacBooks and iPads has been delayed, with “a portion of component orders” pushed back to the second half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORd6Hb"&gt;The issue with MacBooks is said to be related to the ability to mount certain components on circuit boards ahead of the device’s assembly. Delayed iPad production, meanwhile, is apparently because of a shortage of displays and display components. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-05/why-shortages-of-a-1-chip-sparked-crisis-in-the-global-economy"&gt;Bloomberg reported earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; on how the squeezed supply of display drivers is causing a bottleneck across the entire tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lgUF4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"When will the global chip shortage end so you can finally buy a PS5?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Msa7vE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; didn’t state which MacBook or iPad models would be affected, nor whether the postponed production was for existing devices or yet-to-be-announced updates. Apple is widely expected to launch new versions of the iPad Pro this year, as well as continuing the transition to deploying its own processors across the entire Mac line. Analyst Ming-chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/kuo-12-9-inch-mini-led-ipad-pro-production/"&gt;recently said&lt;/a&gt; that a new 12.9-inch iPad Pro with a Mini LED display would go into mass production this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O13ILA"&gt;iPhone production is said to be unaffected so far, though two sources described component supply as “quite tight.” Nikkei says the shortage “remains a supply chain issue for Apple and has not yet had an impact on product availability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zzTFp3"&gt;Related: &lt;/p&gt;
