    <title>Christopher Nolan isn’t happy with Warner Bros. over HBO Max releases</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="54aCmL"&gt;Director Christopher Nolan has fiercely criticized Warner Bros.’ surprise decision to release its 2021 lineup of films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;simultaneously on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, which he called “the worst streaming service.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO4CZZ"&gt;“Some of our industry’s biggest filmmakers and most important movie stars went to bed the night before thinking they were working for the greatest movie studio and woke up to find out they were working for the worst streaming service,” the director &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He added that the studio “had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker’s work out everywhere” but claims it’s dismantling it in a move which “makes no economic sense.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="stbgbY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because they didn’t tell anyone”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0t1sQb"&gt;Although Nolan has long been a fierce defender of watching movies on the big screen, his criticism of Warner Bros.’ decision appears to have a lot to do with how it was handled. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/business/media/warner-bros-hbo-max-movies-pay.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that major agencies and talent management companies associated with the 17 films were kept in the dark about the news until around 90 minutes before it was made public in an attempt to stop details from leaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz1HwD"&gt;“There’s such controversy around it, because [Warner Bros.] didn’t tell anyone,” Nolan &lt;a href="https://www.etonline.com/christopher-nolan-reflects-on-tenet-release-reacts-to-warner-broshbo-max-deal-exclusive-157414"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;ETOnline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “In 2021, they’ve got some of the top filmmakers in the world, they’ve got some of the biggest stars in the world who worked for years in some cases on these projects very close to their hearts that are meant to be big-screen experiences. They’re meant to be out there for the widest possible audiences... And now they’re being used as a loss-leader for the streaming service — for the fledgling streaming service — without any consultation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Q8lR"&gt;Films affected by Warner Bros. announcement include &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Matrix 4.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZI3dP"&gt;“There’s a lot of controversy,” Nolan added, “It’s sort of not how you treat filmmakers and stars and people who, these guys have given a lot for these projects. They deserved to be consulted and spoken to about what was going to happen to their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EY94Gl"&gt;As well as ruffling feathers with a surprise announcement, Warner Bros.’ decision has also raised concerns about the amount of compensation filmmakers could get for their work. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes that many contracts assumed that studios were trying to maximize box office profits, leading to potentially huge payouts for stars who get a portion of ticket sales. Under the new model, streaming subscribers may become a more important target for studios, with potentially big implications for pay packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foC1Y8"&gt;Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was one of the highest profile films to go ahead with a cinematic release this year. Although the director said he was “&lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/11/christopher-nolan-tenet-box-office-thrilled.html"&gt;thrilled&lt;/a&gt;” with its box office performance, the film reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/09/tenet-mulan-global-box-office-numbers-struggle-domestically.html"&gt;struggled to make much of an impact in the US&lt;/a&gt; during its opening weekend. Many theaters across the country were closed during its release, while others were operating at limited capacities. In contrast, other high-profile 2020 films &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354593/mulan-release-date-disney-earnings-warner-bros-tenet-theaters"&gt;released on streaming services&lt;/a&gt;, or were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;delayed &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54396415"&gt;entirely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe5MSm"&gt;Despite the upset, Nolan is confident that people will return to cinemas when it’s safe to do so, telling &lt;em&gt;ETOnline &lt;/em&gt;that “the movie theater experience will bounce back and be a very important part of the ecosystem long-term.” But big questions remain about how willing customers will be to pay for cinema tickets after getting used to watching these big releases from the comfort of their own homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlEvWz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW-backed QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries will enable EVs to travel farther and charge faster</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UUYwMMuNlG-9e2ewLmgF_qGnZkg=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476799/QuantumScape_Lab.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jxuh5L"&gt;After nearly a decade in operation, QuantumScape, a San Jose-based startup backed by Volkswagen and Bill Gates, is finally breaking its silence. In a virtual “battery day” event for investors, the recently public company announced that its “solid state” batteries for electric vehicles will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XCpdZ"&gt;Solid-state batteries have eluded researchers for decades. Most EV companies use “wet” lithium-ion batteries, which use liquid electrolytes to move energy around. But these batteries can be slow to charge, can freeze up in subzero temperatures, and contain flammable material that can be hazardous in the event of a crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnlYr5"&gt;QuantumScape claims to have developed a production-ready solid-state battery with cells that are made of solid and “dry” conductive material. And while most startups pursuing solid-state batteries remain mired in the lab, QuantumScape says it will be ready to go into production in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zQvm87"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to be close to what we’re doing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Di6jwy"&gt;“We don’t see anything on the horizon that’s going to be close to what we’re doing,” said Jagdeep Singh, founder and CEO of QuantumScape, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzzXrM"&gt;QuantumScape says its solid-state batteries will represent a significant improvement over conventional lithium-ion batteries, enabling electric vehicles that can travel 80 percent further than an electric vehicle with a traditional battery. There are other advantages too. They retain more than 80 percent of their capacity after 800 charging cycles. They’re noncombustible. And they’ll have volumetric energy density of more than 1,000 watt-hours per liter at the cell level, which is nearly double the density of top-rate commercial lithium-ion packs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BC_F53T2ZK3R1pI7LVONxRULnFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22152274/QS_Singe_Layer_Pouch_Cell.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;QuantumScape&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;QuantumScape’s key breakthrough: a ceramic separator to replace liquid electrolytes. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SCpj5J"&gt;The key breakthrough is the use of a ceramic “separator” to replace the liquid electrolyte used in conventional battery cells to act as the medium through which positive and negative ions move around. It’s not like any ceramics that you may have at home, in so far as they are designed to be flexible, not rigid. Energy can continue to move throughout the cell in extremely cold temperatures of -30 degrees Celsius — a temperature that renders other solid-state designs inoperable or seriously degrades wet lithium-ion batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHLgQu"&gt;The separator is around the size of a playing card and as thin as a human hair. “At the heart of it all is this new separator,” Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4JDwo"&gt;QuantumScape says its batteries last a real long time, perhaps “hundreds of thousands of miles of driving,” by eliminating the “side reaction” between the liquid electrolyte and the carbon in the anode of the conventional lithium-ion cells. And the batteries will charge at a much faster rate too, up to 80 percent capacity in just 15 minutes, an amount that typically takes 40 minutes or longer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vcT79K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Electric cars could use another big battery breakthrough — this CEO says he’s got it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H15dzx"&gt;Solid-state lithium metal batteries are considered “the holy grail” in the battery industry, said Venkat Viswanathan, an associate professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and a technical advisor to QuantumScape. He pointed out that Stan Whittingham, key figure in the development of lithium-ion batteries and a winner of the &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2019/whittingham/facts/"&gt;2019 Nobel Prize in chemistry&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/192/4244/1126"&gt;published a paper in 1976&lt;/a&gt; about lithium metal anodes, calling it the “basis for a new battery system.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfOCIX"&gt;“This problem is over 40 years old,” Viswanathan told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If lithium metal batteries are successful, this would mean that for mass-market EVs, for the same weight of the battery pack, you can get about 50 percent additional range for EV or additional battery time in the context of consumer electronics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGSvwt"&gt;Whittingham himself is endorsing QuantumScape’s solid-state batteries. In a statement, Whittingham described the hardest part about making a working solid-state battery is “the need to simultaneously meet the requirements of high energy density (1,000 Wh/L), fast charge (i.e., high current density), long cycle life (greater than 800 cycles), and wide temperature-range operation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVkWB1"&gt;“This data shows QuantumScape’s cells meet all of these requirements,” he continued, “something that has never before been reported.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qvwNC4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This problem is over 40 years old”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dSBG1A"&gt;Singh said that consumer electronics like smartphones and laptops would be an obvious application for solid-state batteries, but the demand for the technology is far greater in the auto industry, which is in the midst of a seismic shift away from combustion engines and toward batter-powered propulsion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRD7h2"&gt;“Ordinarily, I would say that we would be pursuing this space as well for consumer devices because, you know, it’s easier,” Singh said. “But we’re finding so much demand. The automotive case is so massive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="25fO47"&gt;QuantumScape, which was spun out from Stanford University in 2010, has formed &lt;a href="https://themobilist.medium.com/vw-one-ups-tesla-with-a-revolutionary-battery-breakthrough-be51849ea092"&gt;a joint venture with VW&lt;/a&gt; to produce solid-state battery cells for the German automaker’s electric vehicles, and eventually for other carmakers. The deal isn’t exclusive: VW’s recently released ID 4 electric SUV will initially use batteries made by South Korea’s LG Chem, before eventually shifting to ones produced by SK Innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwPg11"&gt;QuantumScape recently became &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-quantumscape-m-a-kensington/vw-backed-u-s-battery-maker-quantumscape-to-go-public-at-3-3-billion-valuation-idUSKBN25U1JH"&gt;publicly traded after completing its reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special acquisition company&lt;/a&gt; called Kensington Capital Acquisition. The deal was received well by investors. At a recent price of $42.50 a share, QuantumScape stock is valued at roughly $19 billion, making it one of the top five most valuable automotive suppliers in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHuVyJ"&gt;The race to achieve huge improvements in battery technology is one of the most expensive and hotly contested on the planet right now. Practically every automaker is betting that electric vehicles will be the future, with some of the largest countries (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;largest auto markets&lt;/a&gt;) in the world moving to phase out gas-powered cars and trucks. To ensure that shift, batteries need to more powerful, last longer, and be cheaper to make in order to attract entice enough customers to make the switch to battery-powered vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtMmon"&gt;QuantumScape will be going head-to-head with some of the biggest and best capitalized companies in the world, including China’s CATL (valued at $85 billion), LG Chem ($62 billion), Samsung ($37 billion), Panasonic ($33 billion), and most recently, Tesla ($608 billion). Elon Musk’s electric car company recently announced that it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk"&gt;manufacturing its own battery cells&lt;/a&gt;, and even mine its own lithium, in a massive effort to drive down the cost of its electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYLwH"&gt;Singh said he’s aware that his competition will be fierce. But there’s no reason why QuantumScape’s current rivals won’t become future customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LohWcC"&gt;“Tesla, probably even more than any other company, is completely opportunistic,” Singh said. “If this battery works, they’re gonna want to use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azOj7u"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s SmartThings can finally control your Google Nest devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/anxbVe1gVD-MHpDhle6PYRBNVE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476647/dseifert_201115_4301_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yJB0r7"&gt;Google and Samsung are bringing their smart home platforms together for the first time. Samsung’s SmartThings will support Google Nest devices starting in January 2021, building a bridge between one of the industry’s leading ecosystems for managing smart devices like cameras and thermostats with one of the leading companies developing those products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkeSPv"&gt;Prior to this, owners of devices that qualified for the “Works With SmartThings” (WWST) certification had to use separate software to manage any Google Nest products they owned. Following the launch of the integration next month, all Nest products will be controllable from the SmartThings platform and will qualify as WWST devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NVyU7F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google Nest devices can be managed from the SmartThings app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsaduM"&gt;The partnership further bolsters Samsung’s smart home platform, which is one of the leading hub makers for managing smart home devices on the same network. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/14/6004013/samsung-buys-smartthings-to-gain-a-foothold-in-home-automation"&gt;purchased SmartThings in 2014 for $200 million&lt;/a&gt; due to the company’s proficiency at helping smart home products communicate across various protocol standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgAaGs"&gt;Since then, SmartThings has grown to &lt;a href="https://www.smartthings.com/products"&gt;support thousands of products&lt;/a&gt; as Samsung has pushed to integrate the platform with virtually every smart home brand on the market, with Google remaining a notable exception until today. Samsung says its platform now has more than 120 certified brands and more than 63 million active users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mE1vz"&gt;Samsung says its new Google partnership means Nest devices can be incorporated into SmartThings Scenes for setting up automated controls for multiple devices at the same time, and the integration will also mean Samsung TVs and its Family Hub fridge will support streaming from Nest cameras and other devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YtUUeo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Christchurch shooter was radicalized on YouTube, New Zealand report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VDZz_pY2acvsuGzBVaTuNZay8Pg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476358/VRG_ILLO_3808_001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Corey Brickley for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pLAjaz"&gt;The Australian white supremacist who killed 51 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was radicalized by YouTube, according to &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/"&gt;a 792-page report&lt;/a&gt; on the March 2019 shooting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmwIax"&gt;“What particularly stood out was the statement that the terrorist made that he was ‘not a frequent commentator on extreme right-wing sites and YouTube was a significant source of information and inspiration’,” said Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s Prime Minister, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/dec/08/christchurch-shooting-royal-commission-report-to-be-released-live?page=with:block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296#block-5fcee6ea8f084f47a8a41296"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; “This is a point I plan to make directly to the leadership of YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gEWAm"&gt;This is not the first time YouTube has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/8/28/20836019/youtube-ceo-quarterly-letter-radicalization-pipeline"&gt;linked to radicalization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/mbzzzx/youtube-decides-to-leave-neo-nazi-propaganda-online"&gt;white supremacist content&lt;/a&gt;. There has been an ongoing argument about whether YouTube’s algorithm pushes people &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html"&gt;toward more extreme views&lt;/a&gt; over time. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/30/critics-slam-youtube-study-showing-no-ties-to-radicalization.html"&gt;Although this is not a universal conclusion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/feb/02/how-youtubes-algorithm-distorts-truth"&gt;some researchers say&lt;/a&gt; that the combination of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17876892/youtube-extremism-report-rebecca-lewis-data-society"&gt;a business model that rewards edgy content&lt;/a&gt; and a personalized algorithm meant to keep viewers hooked is a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/10/opinion/sunday/youtube-politics-radical.html"&gt;recipe for radicalization&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKHQLs"&gt;The YouTube citations are part of a larger inquiry into the hate crime to see if it could have been prevented. The shooter &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/part-6-what-public-sector-agencies-knew-about-the-terrorist/evaluation-of-what-public-sector-agencies-did-with-the-information-they-had-about-the-individual/"&gt;sent an email&lt;/a&gt; to Parliament, the Prime Minister’s office, and news outlets eight minutes before he began his attack, according to the report. His manifesto was attached to the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT1RwS"&gt;The authorities weren’t the only ones the shooter alerted. His manifesto was also posted to 8chan, &lt;a href="https://splinternews.com/meet-the-man-keeping-8chan-the-worlds-most-vile-websit-1793856249"&gt;a message board that often hosts far-right content&lt;/a&gt;; included in the post was a link to a Facebook page, where the poster said a livestream of the attack would be broadcast. (Facebook later removed the page and video.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w17pnw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The shooter also modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uipKCb"&gt;A 17-minute video that appeared to show the shooting was uploaded to Facebook YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266859/new-zealand-shooting-video-social-media-manipulation"&gt;The video and the manifesto were mirrored worldwide&lt;/a&gt; and re-uploaded to platforms repeatedly over the following days, often faster than platforms could take them down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keau0x"&gt;The report &lt;a href="https://christchurchattack.royalcommission.nz/the-report/firearms-licensing/general-life-in-new-zealand/"&gt;goes on to say&lt;/a&gt; that though the shooter frequented far-right message boards on 4chan and 8chan, the evidence shows a more substantial use of YouTube. The shooter also  modified his firearms before the attacks using YouTube tutorials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h83SCS"&gt;The shooter also used his Facebook account to discuss Adolph Hitler’s &lt;em&gt;Mein Kampf, &lt;/em&gt;particularly the parts about propaganda that could draw in new extremists, in a group called The Lads Society Season Two. He often posted Islamophobic rhetoric in the group, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now use Waze on CarPlay’s home screen instead of flipping between apps while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A photo showing CarPlay Dashboard with Waze showing directions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1EO1ZuMtd6WBDDy3fg3DBYbs80=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68476259/20201208_Mitchell_Clark_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hlh2tm"&gt;If you use Waze and ever needed to take your eyes off the road to control your music alongside your maps, a new update is starting to roll out that should let you spend more time driving and less time fiddling with that touchscreen. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; is reporting that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/06/waze-carplay-dashboard-goes-live/"&gt;Waze has started rolling out&lt;/a&gt; Apple CarPlay Dashboard support, which will allow you to see directions on CarPlay’s home screen, alongside media controls, calendar events, and more. When I heard about it, I ran out to my car and sure enough, Waze’s directions showed up on the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Apple CarPlay with Waze directions on the left half and top right of the screen, and media controls in the bottom left" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ovvaa1ZZonqS_DZccSkQ065K3gc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153560/IMG_0241.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Waze directions and music controls, all on one screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cUVvUV"&gt;The company started beta testing the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591151/waze-carplay-split-view-dashboard-apple"&gt;late last month&lt;/a&gt;, but CarPlay Dashboard has been around for Apple Maps users since the launch of iOS 13 (though it’s only been open to third-party developers since iOS 13.4). The integration is a win for driving safety, as the golden rule for car UI is basically “look at and touch the screen as little as you possibly can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwyfBf"&gt;Before this update, if you wanted to change the song that was playing, you’d have to go to the Music app, press the next button, then make your way back to Waze. That could be anywhere from 3 to 6 taps on the screen, depending on if Waze was in the app launcher on the side. That’s a lot, especially if you’re going 70 miles an hour. Now, you can have both Waze, the next turn you need to take, and the music controls on the same screen, and changing the song will only take one tap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cYiwL"&gt;In keeping with the safety theme, the update also includes lane guidance, a feature that lets you know in advance what lane you should be in for your next turn or freeway exit. This should help reduce those “I have to be four lanes over in a quarter mile” moments that trip me up on occasion. Happy (and safe) driving!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia will let all users livestream games directly to YouTube tomorrow</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d0zhwxV8Jt91kcL208LFAOYm6Qg=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68475868/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jvALho"&gt;From the very beginning, Google Stadia and YouTube were supposed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18274184/google-stadia-youtube-streaming-future-gaming-cloud"&gt;to work together&lt;/a&gt; — thanks to the magic of cloud computing, you’d be able to click a YouTube ad to instantly begin playing a game, YouTubers would be able to invite their viewers to instantly join their game, and — perhaps most importantly — creators would be able to instantly, effortlessly be able to livestream their Stadia games to YouTube just by pressing a button on the controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKvmnJ"&gt;None of those things happened at Stadia’s launch last November, but the biggest one is apparently arriving tomorrow: every Stadia user will be able to livestream directly to YouTube starting tomorrow, a representative confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX6kPM"&gt;This afternoon, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/07/stadia-youtube-streaming-rollout/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the feature appeared to be rolling out, and we spotted the ability to link a YouTube account in our Stadia accounts as well — though not the ability to actually stream yet. I guess we’ll try that tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wyI6QqpcHzBw5rNHI0j_QeHPpEs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22153571/stream_to_youtube_stadia.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Zu9VPy"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll still have to give your stream a title and tweak a few settings, like whether your stream is appropriate for kids (to comply with children’s protection rules). It’s also not clear whether you’ll be able to stream in 4K quite yet, as Stadia originally promised. You’d also likely need a $9.99 a month Stadia Pro subscription for that, like you do for 4K gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uJJSt"&gt;The feature couldn’t come at a more important time for Stadia: the service’s most important game yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is arriving this week, at a time when next-gen consoles and the latest graphics cards to build your own powerful PC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;are incredibly difficult and expensive to buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;biggest test for Stadia yet&lt;/a&gt;, and one the company is banking on: buying &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;on the service comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;a full set of free Stadia hardware for a limited time&lt;/a&gt; — not unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558820/youtube-premium-subscribers-free-stadia-premiere-edition-bundle-deals"&gt;the set it gave free to YouTube Premium subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XpFaHl"&gt;People streaming &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; from Stadia to YouTube could be the single biggest opportunity yet for Google to prove what its service can do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Second judge says Trump can’t ban TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1b0iBxG466TlEnGi73g_W59q89w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68474797/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gx9fDf"&gt;A federal judge has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297117%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-59-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;granted a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; that should keep the US Commerce Department from banning transactions with TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BycUMg"&gt;The Trump administration issued an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;on August 6th&lt;/a&gt; that would have blocked transactions between US companies and TikTok and WeChat’s Chinese parent companies, ByteDance and Tencent. Trump declared TikTok and WeChat a “national emergency,” citing privacy and security concerns. That order invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law that allows Trump to ban transactions between the US and foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LQVgoy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n8lozD"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F487297119%2FCase-1-20-cv-02658-CJN-Document-60-Filed-12-07-20&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22160239%2Ftiktok-ban-judge-trump-administration-us-commerce-department#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in his opinion&lt;/a&gt; accompanying today’s decision, US district judge Carl Nichols said that “the government likely exceeded IEEPA’s express limitations.” He granted TikTok’s motion for a preliminary injunction against each item the Commerce Department was attempting to prohibit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3HpvQ"&gt;Nichols also previously granted a preliminary injunction on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458375/tiktok-judge-trump-china-ban-app-bytedance"&gt;September 27th&lt;/a&gt; that allowed people to continue downloading the app in the US. At that time, he didn’t rule on the Commerce Department’s other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj0xF3"&gt;A Pennsylvania federal judge had already effectively stopped TikTok from shutting down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542641/tiktok-ban-commerce-department-blocked-november-12-influencers"&gt;on October 30th&lt;/a&gt;, in a ruling on a lawsuit brought by three TikTok creators. The Commerce Department had already conceded the matter last month, saying it wouldn’t enforce the shutdown order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562947/tiktok-us-government-no-shutdown-china-trump-security"&gt;on November 12th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DluYYd"&gt;“We’re pleased that the court agreed with us and granted a preliminary injunction against all the prohibitions of the Executive Order,” a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement. “We’re focused on continuing to build TikTok as the home that 100 million Americans, including families and small businesses, rely upon for expression, connection, economic livelihood, and true joy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1bABR"&gt;“The court’s ruling is consistent with the nationwide preliminary injunction granted by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on October 30, 2020,” a Commerce Department spokesperson said in a statement. “The Department maintains that the E.O. is fully consistent with law and promotes legitimate national security interests. The Government will continue to comply with the injunctions and has taken immediate steps to do so, but intends to vigorously defend the E.O. and the Secretary’s implementation efforts from legal challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHLgaK"&gt;The Trump administration had set a December 4th deadline for ByteDance to sell or spin out TikTok’s business in the US, but the government said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22154801/us-government-tiktok-ban-deadline-bytedance-trump-administration-cfius"&gt;that day&lt;/a&gt; that it would not extend or enforce the deadline. President Trump has said he approves of a bid by Oracle and Walmart “in concept” that would create a US-based entity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21437850/president-trump-approves-oracle-tiktok-partnership-bytedance-china-ban"&gt;TikTok Global&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not clear how that would address some security risks, and the deal has not received final approval from China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With guns drawn, police raid home and seize computers of COVID-19 data whistleblower</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7ZjnLP"&gt;Eight months ago, Deborah Birx of the White House Coronavirus Task Force &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-dr-deborah-birx-discusses-coronavirus-on-face-the-nation-april-19-2020/"&gt;praised Florida’s COVID-19 dashboard&lt;/a&gt; as an example of “the kind of knowledge and power we need to put into the hands of the American people.” That dashboard was built by Rebekah Jones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwXwwE"&gt;But in May, Jones was fired by the Florida Department of Health for reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/29/884551391/florida-scientist-says-she-was-fired-for-not-manipulating-covid-19-data"&gt;refusing to manipulate that data to justify reopening the state&lt;/a&gt; — and now, Florida state police have raided her home and taken the equipment she was using to maintain a new, independent COVID-19 tracker of her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUXgIo"&gt;Jones posted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665"&gt;a series of tweets&lt;/a&gt; about the incident, including a video of police entering — with guns drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YjXZgx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;1/&lt;br&gt;There will be no update today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At 8:30 am this morning, state police came into my house and took all my hardware and tech.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They were serving a warrant on my computer after DOH filed a complaint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They pointed a gun in my face.  They pointed guns at my kids.. &lt;a href="https://t.co/DE2QfOmtPU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DE2QfOmtPU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336065787900145665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HnS2GZ"&gt;Florida’s Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) confirmed &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/coronavirus/article247680010.html"&gt;to the &lt;em&gt;Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2020/12/07/agents-raid-home-fired-florida-data-scientist-who-built-covid-19-dashboard-rebekah-jones/6482817002/"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Tallahassee Democrat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that police had a search warrant and had seized her equipment. Here’s the department’s full statement as provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Txnc2f"&gt;“This morning FDLE served a search warrant at a residence on Centerville Court in Tallahassee, the home of Rebekah Jones. FDLE began an investigation November 10, 2020 after receiving a complaint from the Department of Health regarding unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system which is part of an emergency alert system, to be used for emergencies only. Agents believe someone at the residence on Centerville Court illegally accessed the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBuLx"&gt;When agents arrived, they knocked on the door and called Ms. Jones in an attempt to minimize disruption to the family. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter.  Ms. Jones family was upstairs when agents made entry into the home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="isKyMx"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Tampa Bay Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2020/11/27/floridas-emergency-communications-channel-hacked-according-to-state-officials/"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;, someone mysteriously sent an unauthorized message to the state’s emergency public health and medical coordination team, reading “speak up before another 17,000 people are dead. You know this is wrong. You don’t have to be a part of this. Be a hero. Speak out before it’s too late.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL9ZCf"&gt;According to an affidavit provided to us by the FDLE, law enforcement believes that Jones or someone at her address was the one who sent it. We’re not publishing the affidavit because it contains lots of personally identifying information, but the FDLE claims the message was sent from a Comcast IP associated with her home address and email address, and the affidavit asks permission to seize and search all computer equipment police might find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivIi6Z"&gt;While there was a suggestion last month that the system might have been hacked, it apparently didn’t have particularly strong security anyhow: the affidavit says all of the registered users shared the same username and password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZMdGD"&gt;Jones didn’t comment when we asked, but on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255"&gt;she says&lt;/a&gt; she’s getting a new computer and will continue to update her new website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NT73MJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Desantis thought pointing a gun in my face was a good way to get me to shut up, he's about to learn just how wrong he was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I'll have a new computer tomorrow. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then I'm going to get back to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to help, my website is still at &lt;a href="https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv"&gt;https://t.co/JbQtrVbRuv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GeoRebekah/status/1336081235907637255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine monitoring program may be at risk of false reports</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SroJ7n"&gt;A text-messaging program to monitor any side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine may be open to manipulation, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/12/07/v-safe-tool-covid-vaccine-side-effects/"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Experts worry that the newly-developed system focuses more on ease of use than security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxcaDH"&gt;The program, called v-safe, is being developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to check in with people after they’ve received a COVID-19 vaccine. After getting a shot, they’ll be given a piece of paper with a QR code, which lets them sign up to receive texts. The texts will direct them to online surveys that ask questions about any symptoms someone experienced after receiving the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ebx9WX"&gt;Other vaccine safety monitoring systems that have been in place for decades, including the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), will also be used to follow COVID-19 vaccine recipients. Those are passive systems, and rely on patients or doctors reaching out to make a report. V-safe is intended as an early, active way to understand people’s experience with the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVgS7o"&gt;“It’s going to start collecting data immediately on day zero, and collects data out to 12 months after the second vaccination,” said Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the CDC’s COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, during the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/COVID-04-Shimabukuro.pdf"&gt;meeting last week&lt;/a&gt;. Any serious side effects reported through v-safe could trigger a follow-up call from experts in the call center at VAERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="clPpUV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uCNJh3"&gt;Asking people to access the system through a QR code, though, may leave it vulnerable. Fliers with the codes could be misplaced or left at a vaccination site, and QR codes could be posted online. Anyone picking up that sheet of paper or finding the code could register and submit false responses to the system, unnamed officials told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post. &lt;/em&gt;The anti-vaccine movement organizes online, and officials worry those groups could flood the system. Verification of concerning reports would be time consuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb5TWQ"&gt;In a statement to the &lt;em&gt;Post, &lt;/em&gt;the CDC said the system, “is in the final stage of development, which includes security testing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcnJ3l"&gt;The simplicity of the program has benefits, and unlike other vaccine safety reporting systems, could collect information from people who don’t directly seek medical care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gShTpG"&gt;“With any widely available technology, there’s an opportunity for people to use spoofing and other nefarious techniques,” said Ed Simcox, former chief technology officer at the Department of Health and Human Services, according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. “That would undermine what is so potentially valuable about this system — going directly to patients, or citizens, to get their feedback about multiple vaccines administered in diverse settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2K51hH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google’s COVID contact tracing tech is finally coming to their home state of California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KgYcPpAYyppTXI5dXs4jNWVGPyU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68473379/acastro_200428_1777_coronavirus_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qQmGdz"&gt;After a month of testing on university campuses, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1336006920923013122"&gt;California’s governor just announced&lt;/a&gt; that the state is launching its &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/"&gt;COVID contact tracing app&lt;/a&gt; to the public this Thursday, December 10th. The app is called CA Notify, and its launch makes California &lt;a href="https://www.komando.com/coronavirus/states-with-contact-tracing-apps/758717/"&gt;the 18th state&lt;/a&gt; (plus Washington, DC) to release a contact tracing app. It’s also the largest to have done so since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;technology was announced&lt;/a&gt; in April. The first app of its kind was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355500/virginia-apple-google-contact-tracing-app-covid-alabama"&gt;released in Virginia&lt;/a&gt; back in August, so it’s been quite a long time coming, especially considering California is home to Apple and Google, the two companies that developed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216484/google-apple-coronavirus-contract-tracing-bluetooth-location-tracking-data-app"&gt;contact tracing technology&lt;/a&gt; the app uses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSNLgb"&gt;Apple CEO Tim Cook and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai have tweeted in support of the app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dOJSYC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As we work together to fight the rise in cases in California, exposure notifications will help slow the spread of COVID-19 and put our neighbors’ health first. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Google&lt;/a&gt; for helping bring CA Notify to Californians while putting privacy at the very center. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD"&gt;https://t.co/LbsBQn6zCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1336026658201997318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Z33EIl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;California is facing one of its biggest challenges yet in its fight against COVID-19. CA Notify with the exposure notification technology we developed with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; will be a helpful tool as we work together to slow the spread. Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GavinNewsom&lt;/a&gt; for your leadership. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb"&gt;https://t.co/mnAJBdL1bb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1336010297883066368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1gfRhj"&gt;The app uses the contact tracing API that was added to iOS and Android back in May, and it requires an iPhone with iOS 14.2 or a phone running Android 6.0 or above with Bluetooth Low Energy. Basically, your phone will automatically exchange a private key with another phone if they’re within Bluetooth range. (The key doesn’t contain location or any personally identifying information.) When someone tests positive, they can press a button to send a notification to every other person using the app whose phone virtually bumped into theirs, letting them know that they should get tested and quarantine. If you’re concerned about privacy, it’s worth noting that the exposure notification won’t include any information about who exposed whom or when and where it happened. It will only say that you’ve been exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7K8rN"&gt;If you have an Android phone, the CA Notify app will be available on December 10th for download on the Google Play Store. California’s site &lt;a href="https://canotify.ca.gov/#section4"&gt;has a guide&lt;/a&gt; for iPhone users, but it’s pretty simple: go to the Settings app then to Exposure Notifications. Tapping “Turn on Exposure Notifications” will let you select California as your region and turn on the tracing. (iPhone owners won’t need a separate app.) It also seems like iPhone users will be able to turn it on before the official launch, as shown in the tweet bellow. I’ve tested it, and it does let you add it, but warns you that “you will not be able to share a COVID-19 Diagnosis with other users until CA Notify is fully enabled statewide”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Iypq5x"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  &lt;br&gt;If you live in California, and have an iPhone running iOS 14.2 or newer, you can turn on Exposure notifications ahead of the official launch this Thursday. &lt;br&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/zsMA1w2Af5"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zsMA1w2Af5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ericjboyd (@ericjboyd) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericjboyd/status/1336045941288095745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZeafs"&gt;Since California is home to the tech companies behind the tracing technology, I’m hoping we’ll see a high rate of adoption. It’s just unfortunate that it’s taken seemingly tech-forward states like California (which is currently seeing a spike in cases) this long to roll out the app. Washington state, the home of Microsoft and Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/more-than-1-million-sign-up-for-covid-19-exposure-app-in-washington-state/281-45e39f68-2663-49f4-a8e9-ef0ac8398a6d"&gt;just rolled out its app last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jzRO87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 5:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added tweet showing how you can turn on exposure notifications early on iOS if you live in California.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6GFtx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
