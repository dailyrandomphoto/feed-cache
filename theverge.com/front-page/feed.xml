    <title>These are Sony’s first 360-degree audio speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gc4a7zTG6NNmscqzyA93l2vNWJg=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640844/jxdfau1hhb1wznu95f1c.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6Xhju"&gt;Earlier today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220223/sony-360-degree-audio-video-speakers-software"&gt;Sony announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be releasing two new speakers compatible with 360 Reality Audio, its spatial audio technology that replicates the feel of live music by placing different sounds and vocals in a virtual sphere around you. It said its plan is to release them this spring, but it didn’t share what the speakers would look like. We didn’t have to wait to learn more about them, though, as Sony’s UK website now has full product pages for the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra5000"&gt;SRS-RA5000&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/srs-ra3000"&gt;SRS-RA3000&lt;/a&gt; speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50EA4J"&gt;The higher-end SRS-RA5000, pictured at the top of this post, will have three up-firing speakers, three side speakers, and a woofer. It’s also certified for High-Resolution Audio. The SRS-RA3000, pictured below, has two tweeters, two passive radiators, and a full-range driver. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCdfVqh8RVZ_DdvHVORKjDUu9Mw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223041/imydsjfdmwz4rleeuiah.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s SRS-RA3000 speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwHxvM"&gt;Both speakers can calibrate themselves to the room they’re in with an internal microphone and a “unique Sony algorithm,” too. With the SRS-RA5000, you have to press and hold a button on the speaker, while the SRS-RA3000 can calibrate itself automatically. The two speakers also have Sony’s Auto Volume feature, which adjusts the volume of each track automatically to play them at a consistent volume. And both speakers support Amazon’s Alexa and Google Assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B55Fyr"&gt;The SRS-RA5000 will cost approximately £500 / €599, while the SRS-RA3000 is priced at about £280 / €359, according to the &lt;a href="https://presscentre.sony.co.uk/pressreleases/change-the-way-you-listen-to-music-at-home-with-sonys-new-srs-ra5000-and-srs-ra3000-wireless-home-speakers-3063448"&gt;press release on Sony’s UK website&lt;/a&gt;. That also says both speakers will arrive in February 2021, which is a bit sooner than the previous “spring” date we had heard before, so perhaps there will be different release dates in different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egt1vM"&gt;Sony said it is expanding the 360 Reality Audio platform from audio to video &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202101/21-001E/"&gt;earlier on Friday&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is working with major music labels and service providers to begin streaming video content with the codec later this year. Approximately 4,000 songs currently support the format, according to Sony.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter bans QAnon supporters, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn Returns To Court" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06EH7_0DatYPJHgeWsjKyciiRno=/0x41:3000x2041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640749/1151710958.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alex Wroblewski / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlITS5"&gt;Twitter has suspended prominent backers of the QAnon conspiracy theory, citing a potential for “offline harm.” &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/twitter-bans-michael-flynn-sidney-powell-qanon-account-purge-n1253550"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; reporter Ben Collins reported&lt;/a&gt; the ban of former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, and former 8kun administrator Ron Watkins. Other major QAnon accounts have apparently been banned as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwx3Kg"&gt;Twitter told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that the accounts were suspended under Twitter’s “coordinated harmful activity” ban. “We’ve been clear that we will take strong enforcement action on behavior that has the potential to lead to offline harm, and given the renewed potential for violence surrounding this type of behavior in the coming days, we will permanently suspend accounts that are solely dedicated to sharing QAnon content,” a spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZISQH"&gt;Flynn and Powell have both promoted theories linked to QAnon, a sprawling conspiracy movement united against a nonexistent cabal of devil-worshipping pedophiles. Flynn was convicted of lying to the FBI, but he was &lt;a href="https://chorus.voxmedia.com/compose/6e715a62-b3e8-4126-8507-7067fa39fd1a"&gt;pardoned by President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and has become a QAnon evangelist. Powell has been instrumental in promoting false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged, leading Dominion Voting Systems to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220553/dominion-conspiracy-theory-lawsuit-former-trump-lawyer-voting-machine"&gt;file a defamation suit against her&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. Watkins formerly helped run 8kun (formerly 8chan), the anonymous message board where QAnon head Q posts cryptic messages to followers. Researchers speculate Q &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgqj7x/qanons-mysterious-leader-q-is-actually-multiple-people"&gt;may be multiple people&lt;/a&gt;, and both Ron and his father Jim Watkins have been named as potential Q authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FaxsU"&gt;Twitter is late in taking action against the group. Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504887/facebook-qanon-ban-all-apps-pages-groups-instagram-accounts"&gt;banned QAnon content&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, calling the group a “militarized social movement.” TikTok likewise &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21522896/tiktok-removing-accounts-qanon-conspiracy-social-media"&gt;banned QAnon content&lt;/a&gt; for violating its disinformation policy. Until recently, however, Twitter hosted some of QAnon’s most high-profile figures. That included the names above, as well as David Hayes (known as “Praying Medic”), a major QAnon theory interpreter and part of a group that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534900/youtube-qanon-channels-conspiracy-theory-lawsuit-deplatformed"&gt;sued YouTube for its own QAnon crackdown&lt;/a&gt; last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gdkYwb"&gt;QAnon supporters were among the Trump backers who mobbed the US Capitol earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attempting to overturn&lt;/a&gt; the results of the US presidential election. Trump himself has also expressed support for QAnon, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/535e145ee67dd757660157be39d05d3f"&gt;calling its supporters&lt;/a&gt; “people that love our country.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vape batteries can cause deadly explosions, consumer safety agency warns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="No-Tobacco Day In Poland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Cw136W31E3xfm01c6Piry7rnyg=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640697/1216547481.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Artur Widak / NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dbgqOa"&gt;Consumers should not buy or use individual 18650 lithium-ion battery cells due to possible fire risk, according to a warning just issued by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The commission says it is working with e-commerce sites like eBay to remove listings of loose 18650 cells, which are sometimes used in vapes, e-cigarettes, flashlights, and toys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7RtWZl"&gt;“[T]hese battery cells may have exposed metal positive and negative terminals that can short-circuit when they come into contact with metal objects, such as keys or loose change in a pocket,” the agency wrote Friday. “Once shorted, loose cells can overheat and experience thermal runaway, igniting the cell’s internal materials and forcibly expelling burning contents, resulting in fires, explosions, serious injuries and even death.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUJXnB"&gt;Injuries related to exploding 18650 cells have been documented for a few years now, but the frequency seems to have increased along with their availability on sites like Amazon or from wholesale retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x76jpY"&gt;One of the companies that makes 18650 cells, LG Chem, asked distributors of e-cigarette equipment in a late 2018 letter to stop selling them, warning that “[i]ndividual consumer use and handling” that could “lead to severe burns and disfigurement,” according &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2019/04/lithium-ion-batteries-amazon-are-exploding/587005/"&gt;to a report in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung and Sony also warn consumers against using the cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YSQn24"&gt;18650 cells are often used in more heavy-duty commercial settings, and even power Tesla’s Model X and Model S vehicles — though the CPSC acknowledges that’s fine, since it’s their intended use. That said, there is a small but growing DIY community springing up around building &lt;a href="https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Professional-18650-Battery-Pack/"&gt;custom battery packs&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://evnerds.com/tech/ev-battery/how-to-build-a-diy-electric-bicycle-lithium-battery-from-18650-cells/"&gt;e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RigE5x11kpY"&gt;electric cars&lt;/a&gt; using 18650 cells bought on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnxHnW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hundreds of Twitter employees call for Trump to be banned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vacEkOmDYY2swlGM9lV15AH1nOE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640689/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3664ZB"&gt;More than 300 Twitter employees have signed an internal petition calling for President Donald Trump to be permanently banned from the platform following a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpvJ0i"&gt;The letter says the employees are “disturbed” by the attack and that Twitter must “permanently suspend” Trump because of his involvement, according to a copy of the letter seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;first&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on the letter’s circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05uAJS"&gt;“We must examine Twitter’s complicity in what President-Elect Biden has rightly termed insurrection. Those acts jeopardize the wellbeing of the United States, our company, and our employees,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4K2L2c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We must learn from our mistakes in order to avoid causing future harm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTsYBx"&gt;The letter writers also call for Twitter to “provide a clear account” of the company’s decision to temporarily suspend Trump’s account and to investigate “Twitter’s role in today’s insurrection.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDVHbG"&gt;“We must learn from our mistakes in order to avoid causing future harm,” they wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHaJTf"&gt;The letter has been signed by more than 300 people over the last two days, according to a person familiar with its circulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBGJAB"&gt;The pushback inside Twitter follows stronger action from Facebook, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;suspended Trump indefinitely&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms began removing posts or restricting his account on Wednesday after the president posted a video praising the mob that attacked the Capitol. The Alphabet Workers Union has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220778/alphabet-workers-union-demands-youtube-ban-trump"&gt;called on YouTube to ban Trump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV4AXm"&gt;Twitter employees have been pushing back against leadership in company-wide Slack rooms as well. “I feel like we’ve bent over backwards to craft policies to allow Trump to stay up and to say what he has,” one employee wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5LiCHJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Dorsey said Twitter had drawn “a very clear line in the sand”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yNAmqh"&gt;“This conversation has focused on how rigorously we have enforced our existing policies ... Do we consider that there may be problems with our policies themselves?” wrote another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm0Ujd"&gt;On Thursday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sent a message to staff saying that the company’s actions around Trump were important for establishing trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrxoMk"&gt;“It’s important we follow a clear and public rule set that can endure beyond any one moment,” Dorsey wrote. “Why? In order to earn trust. I know it may not feel that way right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1d7nm"&gt;Dorsey also argued that it was up to elected leaders to repair the damage from Wednesday’s attack. “We aren’t the government,” he said. “Our elected officials must do the work to right this and bring the country together. Our role is around the integrity of the conversation of that work, and doing everything we can to promote healthy discourse, knowing it’s not always going to be accepted in the short term. But it will be over the long term. I’m certain of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ojqd5O"&gt;Dorsey said that Twitter had drawn “a very clear line in the sand” by saying it would permanently suspend Trump if he further violated the platform’s rules. “If that line is crossed, we will do what we said we are going to do,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4Xant"&gt;During a company all-hands meeting on Friday, employees were told there would be a “retrospective” on the company’s recent policy decisions, according to screenshots of a Slack conversation seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Employees were also urged not to leak more information to the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xcy15h"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Twitter spokesperson said: “Twitter encourages an open dialogue between our leadership and employees, and we welcome our employees to express their thoughts and concerns in whichever manner feels right to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1GirD1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 8th, 5:16PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with a statement from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Damages from US weather and climate disasters reached a new record in 2020 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="wildfire smoke" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GKv-xc5uwGa7vQYUYatNYDOmIM=/0x0:5380x3587/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640637/1277648563.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oCYddB"&gt;The US experienced a record number of billion-dollar disasters in 2020. Twenty-two disasters cost the US a cumulative $95 billion last year, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). That smashes previous records set in 2011 and 2017, when 16 disasters caused at least a billion dollars of damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6JeQwy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Climate change is hitting the US hard in the pocketbook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="klOuWG"&gt;NOAA’s &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/stories/record-number-of-billion-dollar-disasters-struck-us-in-2020"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; is the latest signal that climate change is hitting the US hard in the pocketbook. It follows the release of &lt;a href="https://www.munichre.com/en/company/media-relations/media-information-and-corporate-news/media-information/2021/2020-natural-disasters-balance.html"&gt;another report&lt;/a&gt; by insurance company Munich Re that also tallied 2020 disaster costs and found they had nearly doubled in the US since 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQYBRM"&gt;“Climate change plays a role in this upward trend of losses,” Ernst Rauch, Munich Re chief climate scientist, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/climate/2020-disaster-costs.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1g2ue"&gt;Heatwaves and droughts on their own caused $4.5 billion in damages, &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/2020"&gt;according to NOAA&lt;/a&gt;. The hot, dry conditions also fueled unprecedented wildfires that tore through the west. Flames ate up more than 10 million acres across the country, the most since 2000. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537195/colorado-wildfires-beetle-infestations-forests-east-troublesome"&gt;Colorado&lt;/a&gt; saw three of its largest wildfires ever last year, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429437/san-francisco-sky-fire-drone-photographs-west-coast-wildfires"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt; doubled its previous record for most acres burned. All in all, wildfire damages topped $16 billion in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rsFOIm"&gt;The extremely active Atlantic hurricane season was also costly. By the end of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;exhausting season&lt;/a&gt;, there were more tropical cyclones on NOAA’s billion-dollar disaster list this year than ever before. Those seven storms combined came with a price tag of $40.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="IivXbb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s just been crazy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Agzdz0"&gt;“It’s just been crazy,” Allison Wing an assistant professor of meteorology at Florida State University, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; near the end of hurricane season in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIBjzl"&gt;Ten more severe weather events made NOAA’s list, including hail storms in Texas and the derecho in the Midwest that damaged millions of acres of crops. In just 14 hours on August 10th, the wind storm caused more than $11 billion in damages. Tornado outbreaks also tore through the Southeast, taking out homes and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Metro Nashville Airport Authority announced Wednesday its John C. Tune Airport on the city’s west side sustained an estimated $93 million in infrastructure damage alone due to the recent tornado. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4nB7iPsdE7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4nB7iPsdE7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NashvillePost (@NashvillePost) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NashvillePost/status/1235319309657874435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="OsoSNR"&gt;2020 was a doozy for a lot of reasons, but weather and climate-related disasters are part of a larger pattern of havoc wreaked by global warming. This marked the &lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/"&gt;sixth year in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the US had experienced more than 10 billion-dollar disasters in a calendar year.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>John Legere is considering becoming the Un-Candidate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xg6u0TRkhDWfxnBQf1GFY7rWTSs=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68640329/JohnLegere_batman.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: John Legere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U6Gzx8"&gt;John Legere, former T-Mobile CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/7/10729714/john-legere-carrier-bullshit"&gt;aspiring Batman&lt;/a&gt;, has reacted to the mob that attacked the Capitol like many other political and business leaders by calling for President Donald Trump to step down. But he’s also going a step further by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?s=19"&gt;considering a run for political office himself&lt;/a&gt;. Legere left his post as CEO and member of T-Mobile’s board after successfully negotiating the merger between the company and Sprint, so he very well could be looking far and wide for his next gig.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wzfrsy"&gt;Legere’s time as T-Mobile’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/mobile/2013/3/26/4149204/tmobile-new-direction-no-contracts-lte-uncarrier"&gt;turned the company into the “Un-Carrier,”&lt;/a&gt; a plan that came with an end to contracts, revamped mobile plans, and a variety of freebies and perks for customers designed to set T-Mobile apart from its longtime rivals AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon. But what would political candidacy — or un-candidacy — look like for Legere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sPHao7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For the first time in my life I am actually considering the possibility of running for office. It’s clear somebody needs to help real Americans find change. I’m not sure I’m capable, but I can’t stand by simply watching this craziness.&lt;/p&gt;— John Legere (@JohnLegere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1347374021495681024?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8XygjM"&gt;Well, if it’s anything like his Un-Carrier moves, it could be a mixed bag. Legere &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2016/6/3/11852870/t-mobile-legere-montage"&gt;was brash and unafraid to roast the competition&lt;/a&gt;, and his attitude and leather jackets lean more un-presidential (or Cool) than anything else. But given the last four years we’ve had, we’re probably all used to the unconventional at this point. Tone matters less than not attempting to dissolve democracy, so the bar is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFWyyr"&gt;In terms of policy, popular proposals like &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/2/24/21151143/bernie-sanders-2020-polls-medicare-for-all"&gt;Medicare-for-all&lt;/a&gt; fit nicely within the logic of Legere’s Un-Carrier programs. A large part of Un-Carrier’s offering was zero-rating data from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/18/5822996/t-mobile-music-freedom-net-neutrality"&gt;certain music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/10/9704482/t-mobile-uncarrier-binge-on-netflix-hbo-streaming"&gt;video streaming services&lt;/a&gt; so it wouldn’t count against T-Mobile customers’ bills. Why not do the same thing with costly medical expenses? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Vj3ug"&gt;Of course, this opens up another can of worms. Legere was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/10/7190109/do-you-want-net-neutrality-or-not-john-legere"&gt;publicly in support of net neutrality&lt;/a&gt; while he was CEO but pushed programs that flaunted it. Those zero-rating schemes, like Binge On and T-Mobile’s other perks, actively favored the services that struck a deal with the company. A healthy internet and a strong Federal Communications Commission might not be at the top of Legere’s priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBl3s7"&gt;There’s no telling how serious Legere actually is or if a run would involve him appearing as the heightened version of himself that made him the unofficial mascot of T-Mobile, but there is a precedent. Executives from the wider world of the tech industry, &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-feb-10-me-whitman10-story.html"&gt;like former HP CEO Meg Whitman&lt;/a&gt;, have made attempts to hold a political office, and a businessperson thinking they could fix the country or a state in the same way they juice quarterly revenue is a common theme in modern US politics. I’m not holding my breath for a T-Mobile magenta paint job for the White House or press briefings styled as keynotes, but god it would make a good story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Looks like Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro and SmartTags are a lock for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SbbyOY1_iDrZfzRaeGwmNzlwzwg=/457x0:2043x1057/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639957/e31b969143b271229f5243aae0fc864fd5f050c10f701deba1a172fab2d354f7.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Galaxy Buds Pro collection.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/profile/evan" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="liR6Ii"&gt;Samsung is widely expected to announce its Galaxy S21 lineup of phones at its upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;January 14th event&lt;/a&gt;, and now it looks like we can safely assume that Samsung will launch its next true wireless headphones and its Tile competitor at the event as well. A leaked marketing render of a promotion offering either the unannounced Galaxy Buds Pro or a Galaxy SmartTag alongside a preorder of the Galaxy S21 Ultra was shared by leaker Evan Blass &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1347616671960338435"&gt;on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/61Ghy7SP8QWvqhfLP7I1ZZldNbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223025/ErOyNTuXcAAjdh8__1_.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The leaked marketing image of the promotion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JncsUe"&gt;A lot of information about both the Galaxy Buds Pro and the Galaxy SmartTags have hit the web recently, so it’s not a big surprise that we can expect to see them announced on January 14th. Details about the Galaxy Buds Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/24/22198622/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-price-specs-active-noise-cancelation"&gt;leaking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22193235/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-3d-spatial-audio-leak"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;weeks&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212894/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-leak-hands-on-video-specs-features-battery-life-sound-quality"&gt;YouTuber even posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/VAGUMP0xsio"&gt;a hands-on&lt;/a&gt; with the true wireless headphones on January 3rd. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;also seen photos&lt;/a&gt; of the SmartTag tracker, which is rumored to be a Tile-like tracker that uses Bluetooth to connect with nearby devices, thanks to filings spotted on Taiwan’s telecom regulator’s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JPw2uc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Pro may be a preorder gift that’s exclusive to the (presumably more expensive) Galaxy S21 Ultra, though. If you opt to preorder the Galaxy S21 or S21 Plus, you’ll be able to get a free pair of Samsung’s bean-shaped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; instead, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785"&gt;Twitter user @TheGalox_&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zdujsb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In most countries, Samsung will also have the same pre-order gifts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Live &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the S21 or S21+&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro &amp;amp; Smart Tags when you pre-order the Galaxy S21 Ultra &lt;a href="https://t.co/vnbucTbmPQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/vnbucTbmPQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Anthony (@TheGalox_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheGalox_/status/1347506216596086785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zPoa6V"&gt;We’re just under a week away from Samsung’s January 14th event, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering everything from the big day.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us was 2020’s most downloaded mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yho9_oGNaaGAwro1StqF1fVVVXg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639929/ss_eab32f16b59c005489c10f9063227ed7b54b31ec.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P4vZBG"&gt;In 2020, more mobile users downloaded &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; than any other game worldwide. Data released by &lt;a href="https://blog.apptopia.com/worldwide-us-download-leaders-2020"&gt;Apptopia&lt;/a&gt; ranks the year’s breakout hit at 41 million downloads in the US and 264 million downloads worldwide — beating out games such as &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, which both remain in the top 10 highest-grossing games of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89Etw2"&gt;Despite being released in 2018, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; didn’t find popular footing until the last year. The online multiplayer deduction game, in which spaceship crew members work together to complete tasks and root out imposters before they’re murdered, became a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21523878/aoc-twitch-stream-among-us-pokimane"&gt;hit on Twitch &lt;/a&gt;late into quarantine. In November, almost &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;half a billion people&lt;/a&gt; played the game, which is available on mobile, the Nintendo Switch, and PC. A release is &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/17/22187408/among-us-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-launch-release-dates-2021"&gt;also planned&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE15LO"&gt;As for the team that made &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, InnerSloth is an independent developer with only four employees. The game has become so popular that the developer actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;canned a sequel&lt;/a&gt; in order to keep working on the original. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s App Store made an estimated $64 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1KGftnuRi0M1JL9oBjZ7X5Pizck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639783/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KcvAtL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;According to CNBC’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s App Store made $64 billion in revenue in 2020, which is a 28 percent increase from the estimated $50 billion it made in 2019. This represents a good amount of growth for the App Store since the estimated increase between 2018 and 2019 was only 3.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gnEwX"&gt;It’s hard to tell the exact reason for the spike in growth, but it likely had something to do with the COVID-19 pandemic. I can say from personal experience that I bought quite a few more games in 2020 than I have in years past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup/22206745/2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place"&gt;as well as subscriptions to fitness&lt;/a&gt; and productivity apps to try to regain some control of my life during quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwJfxj"&gt;When Apple reports on its financials, it lumps the money it makes from the App Store in with its services revenue, &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/apple-to-release-financial-results-amid-global-crisis/"&gt;which is by far its fastest-growing category&lt;/a&gt;. The company takes a 30 percent cut of most of the money coming in to the App Store, which, while there are caveats and exceptions, represents billions of dollars of revenue. Apple typically guards its take carefully, despite recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;pushback from developers like Hey.com&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;legal challenges from Epic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVKrKD"&gt;Its grip has recently loosened just a little, though, as Apple now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;only takes a 15 percent cut from developers who make under $1 million a year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store. That isn’t likely to have a huge change on the revenue estimates, as analysts have approximated that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;the top 2 percent of App Store developers generate 95 percent of the revenue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu63PU"&gt;Every year, Apple reports how much money it has paid out to developers since 2008. CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;used that to calculate the App Store revenue number by subtracting last year’s number from this year’s, then it accounts for Apple’s 30 percent cut. While the numbers may be a little rough, Apple doesn’t self-report them, so all we can do is get close. Regardless, there are two things that are hard to argue: the App Store’s revenue grew by quite a bit this year, and it brought in a lot of money for both developers and for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ultra-cheap Samsung A02S is coming to the US, documentation suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A02S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWoXAvJrXTqyIE1xuiPs06Ji8Jk=/83x99:1358x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639733/pk_feature_power_that_keeps_you_going_358694490.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A02S offers a 6.5-inch display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cKNNc4"&gt;Unlocked and carrier versions of the budget Samsung Galaxy A02S appear to be coming to the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/unlocked-carrier-bound-galaxy-a02s-variants-headed-for-usa/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth certification documents appear to refer to unlocked as well as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T carrier versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzMy1"&gt;The A02S was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt; for European markets alongside the slightly higher-specced Galaxy A12. The A02S includes a 6.5-inch HD+ display and an impressive 5,000mAh battery, but it cuts costs by opting for 3GB of RAM and 32GB of (expandable) storage in the base model and a 13-megapixel main camera. It also lacks a fingerprint sensor. These sacrifices land it at an affordable €150 price point, and it will likely sell for less than $200 outright in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KeYPn"&gt;There’s no official word from Samsung yet on North American availability. In Europe, the A02S is set to go on sale in February.&lt;/p&gt;
