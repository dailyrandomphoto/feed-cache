    <title>Mastodon now has an official iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuqtDryL8A5gdJtWPwW5ae3Yd54=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658958/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucykbC"&gt;Decentralized social network Mastodon now has an official iPhone app. The nonprofit behind Mastodon &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974"&gt;launched the app&lt;/a&gt; on iOS today, supplementing an existing web version and several &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps"&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The app is free and offers a similar feature set to Mastodon’s core service, although it doesn’t include Mastodon’s broad local and federated timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtPWX7"&gt;Mastodon describes the app as particularly geared toward getting new users on board the nontraditional social platform. As we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;outlined before&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon looks similar to Twitter but is built around &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities"&gt;independently run communities&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol) rather than a single central network. You can create your account on a community of your choice while following and messaging people in other communities as well. It’s an unusual design among modern social platforms, and offering an official iOS entry point could help ease people into it more smoothly. CEO Eugen Rochko confirmed plans for a comparable Android app, but there’s no timeline for releasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDrL1W"&gt;Mastodon’s iOS app supports features like polls and sensitive content filters, and the app page subtly highlights its differences with bigger services like Twitter by mentioning Mastodon’s “ad-free, chronological timeline.” As mentioned above, however, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; find a section for local and federated timelines — Mastodon’s firehose of all public posts from your home community and the communities of people linked with it, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcDHdT"&gt;Rochko tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that those timelines were a “suboptimal” way to discover new content, and excluding them also reduced the potential for conflict with Apple, which has required some social networks to limit what users can find through their apps. (Reddit’s iOS app, for instance, makes you opt into NSFW content through the web.) For a different feature set, you can keep using one of the existing iOS apps — or just log in through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Megapack burst into flames at ‘Victorian Big Battery’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rendering of the “Victorian Big Battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9ran_NXmsSFkbvZS5RfpF3IXME=/1x0:1999x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658426/VBB_Our_Battery.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRoUZL"&gt;A Tesla Megapack &lt;a href="https://victorianbigbattery.com.au/incident-at-vbb/"&gt;caught fire&lt;/a&gt; today during initial testing of a highly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551342/australia-power-grid-victorian-big-battery"&gt;anticipated new utility-scale battery&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, Australia. Luckily, there were no injuries or disruptions to the local electricity supply, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/30/tesla-megapack-caught-fire-at-victorian-big-battery-site-in-australia.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reports. The blaze posed no risk of spreading to the nearby community, according to &lt;a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fire-erupts-at-tesla-big-battery-in-australia-during-testing?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it did trigger a toxic smoke warning for residents who were told to stay indoors, the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fire-breaks-out-during-testing-of-victorian-big-battery-near-geelong-20210730-p58eh4.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The cause of the fire is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZTrBh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JUST IN: Fire crews are currently on the scene of a battery fire at Moorabool, near Geelong. Firefighters are working to contain the fire and stop it spreading to the nearby batteries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3"&gt;https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7NEWS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#7NEWS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HAkFY27JgQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HAkFY27JgQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 7NEWS Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/7NewsMelbourne/status/1420932114296446987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jczpWD"&gt;The fire affected the aptly named “Victorian Big Battery.” Spanning an area nearly as big as a football stadium, it’s one of the largest in the world. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.neoen.com/var/fichiers/2021-02-25-media-release-vbb-fc.pdf"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to be operational by the end of this year, and the 300MW battery should be able to store enough energy to power more than a million homes in Victoria for half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Up7O"&gt;That’s supposed to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/victorian-blackouts-what-caused-them-and-is-this-the-new-normal/10751412"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt; that have affected hundreds of thousands of homes in the region in recent years, especially in the summer when demand for electricity spikes. Giant batteries are also crucial to meeting environmental and renewable energy goals. The state of Victoria aims to get half of its electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2030. Batteries can fill in the gaps in energy supply when the sun doesn’t shine and winds don’t blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcP7l"&gt;French renewable energy company Neoen is developing the Victorian Big Battery alongside Tesla and energy company AusNet Services. Neoen and Tesla brought another grid-scale battery online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16723186/elon-musk-battery-launched-south-australia"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world at the time.  Neoen did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uYy7vf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: this quarter’s earnings for Apple, Samsung, Google, and Microsoft</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLA4kbFVe5yIvwBFZjqDivBJqpw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658113/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNu3A0"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eR9GXx"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg to chat about the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAzEz0"&gt;It’s earnings week once again. Unsurprisingly, all of the big tech companies made a lot of money this past quarter. Our podcast crew dives into the numbers behind the profits of Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, and Apple and what it means for each business’s future goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq9qnE"&gt;The show also dedicates some time to discuss Intel’s business. Chaim leads the discussion after writing a story about Intel’s worst summer last year and how it’s been fighting its way back since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5i9dTN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DRLPg"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or in your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>June heatwave was the ‘most extreme’ on record for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fires in Lytton, British Columbia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGjpyoSwIcznEVGPYfXzTOnoos8=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657783/1233843473.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HksXk"&gt;The devastating heatwave that struck the Northwest US and southwest Canada in June was “the most extreme summer heatwave” ever recorded in North America, according to a new &lt;a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/june-2021-temperature-update/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from nonprofit research group Berkeley Earth. That’s based on the magnitude of the heatwave, or how much warmer it was than normal. Record temperatures in the region reached roughly 20 degrees Celsius (or 36 °F) hotter than average in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Km4B"&gt;Canada recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/30/canada-record-heat-experts-react/"&gt;hottest temperature ever&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th when the village of Lytton in British Columbia reached an astonishing 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit). Typical temperatures there in June are closer to 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcqjHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyuqh"&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering. Scorching temperatures fed wildfires, which burned down &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/americas/canada-lytton-wildfire-climate-change-indigenous-intl-cmd/index.html"&gt;90 percent of Lytton&lt;/a&gt;. There were at least &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-dome-sudden-deaths-570-1.6122316"&gt;570 heat-related deaths in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths#:~:text=Record%2Dbreaking%20US%20Pacific%20north%2Dwest%20heatwave%20killed%20almost%20200%20people,-Officials%20reported%20116&amp;amp;text=The%20death%20toll%20from%20the,and%2078%20in%20Washington%20state."&gt;194 in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands more people wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;in emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz8ei1"&gt;The late June heatwave was a “1,000-year event…hopefully,” according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/preliminary-analysis-concludes-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-was-1000-year"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The severity of the heat would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, both NOAA and a separate &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from an international team of researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__gejqvpocyna"&gt;For the entire Northern Hemisphere, it was the warmest June on record averaged across all land areas. Nearly 4 percent of the surface of the Earth hit record high average temperatures during the first half of 2021, according to the Berkeley Earth analysis. That’s despite the cooling effect of a La Niña event. Looking at the first six months of the year, “Nowhere has been record cold,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1421131167210819599"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley Earth lead scientist Robert Rohde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7c6MKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuja40"&gt;Globally, the odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves like the one that took such a huge toll in the US and Canada in June are likely on the rise. Prolonged, record-breaking extreme heat events are two to seven times more likely to take place from now until 2050 compared to the previous three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this week. That estimate is based on a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stay high, like they are today. There’s still some hope of avoiding that future — but first, humanity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;will have to stop burning&lt;/a&gt; quite so many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘May be an image’: what it’s like browsing Instagram while blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znhhRhwoXG3kuYzwCPkZfgBYjcU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657662/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ridiculous sounds of social sites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WWfjrj"&gt;Using a screen reader to navigate Instagram, as some people with low vision do, is a strange patchwork of sounds. It can be overwhelming, especially if you’re used to quickly scanning information with your eyes, to hear a synthetic voice clunkily rattle off usernames, timestamps, and like counts as though they’re all equally important as the actual content of the post. Among all that auditory stimulation, if someone added alt text to their photo, you might hear something like “John and I standing with our ankles in the water at the beach. John is making a distressed face while I menacingly hold out a dead crab and laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTXr2N"&gt;The image descriptions used by screen readers have to be added by users, and like many accessibility features in social media, those fields are regularly neglected. In those cases, the voice will sometimes recite alt text that Instagram or the user’s device generates automatically. The result, Danielle McCann, the social media coordinator for the National Federation of the Blind, tells me, can be pretty funny. The descriptions that have evolved from &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-people-who-are-blind-or-visually-impaired/"&gt;years of machine learning&lt;/a&gt; still often misidentify what’s happening in photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDNI3j"&gt;Recently, she was scrolling through Instagram when her screen reader said there was a photo of “two brown cats lying on a textured surface.” Her husband informed her that it was actually a bridal shop ad featuring a woman in a wedding dress. “Thank goodness I wasn’t [commenting] like, ‘Oh those cats are cute,’ you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUS7yR"&gt;These kinds of algorithmic misinterpretations are pretty common. Here’s a sampling of descriptions I heard while I browsed Instagram with VoiceOver on my phone: “red polo, apple, unicorn” (a photo of a T-shirt with a drawing of a couch on it), “may be an image of indoor” (a photo of a cat next to a house plant), “may be an image of food” (a photo of sea shells), “may be a cartoon” (almost every illustration or comic panel), and a whole lot of “may be an image of one person” (a variety of photos featuring one or more people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyubbx"&gt;As devices have gained accessibility settings like magnification, high contrast, and built-in screen readers, social media has also slowly become more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision: many sites and apps respond to users’ device settings, have options to toggle light and dark modes, and enable users to compose image descriptions. But the existence of those features doesn’t guarantee people with disabilities won’t be excluded online. Social media accessibility is a group effort. People have to know about the features, understand what they are, and actually remember to use them. A platform can have a hundred accessibility options, but without buy-in from every user, people are still left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXy3xP"&gt;Even when people use alt text, they often don’t fully think through what’s important to convey to someone who can’t see photos. Some people will write overly simplistic descriptions like “red flower” or “blonde girl looking at sky,” without actually describing what it is about the images that makes them worth sharing. At the other end, multiple paragraphs of text to describe one image can be annoying to navigate with a screen reader. McCann tells friends to think of alt text as a writing exercise: “How do you provide as much information in as few words as possible?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K67Hzr"&gt;“The general rule is to be informative, not poetic,” says the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). “But on social media, feel free to add some personality — you’re probably sharing that picture of your dog because he has a hilarious quizzical expression, for example, not because he is a black-and-white pitbull mix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcv144"&gt;While automated image descriptions might eventually improve beyond the level of mistaking a woman in a wedding dress for some cats, they can’t replace the human element. Facebook had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681231/facebook-outage-image-tags-captions-ai-machine-learning-revealed"&gt;image outage&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that showed all of its users the photo tags that are usually hidden, displaying machine-assigned descriptors like “Image may contain: people standing.” Are the people contained in that image embracing and making goofy faces? Are they standing in front of a breathtaking vista? Social media can feel a lot less social if your access to the content shared within it relies on computers’ conservative interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKvMyR"&gt;Advocates stress that accessibility should always be a consideration from the start, “not as an add-on to an already-existing platform well after the fact,” says AFB. But most popular platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, didn’t take that route during initial development, and are instead constantly playing catch-up to improve their accessibility. When those improvements roll out, it’s never guaranteed that people will consistently use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwIby5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nuEW73"&gt;One of the biggest barriers is the assumption that blind people just won’t be interested in visual media. “Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision,” says McCann. “I think that’s one big misconception: ‘Oh, well, they don’t care about pictures.’ But we do.” When culture is molded on social networks, it sucks to lose out on a shared social language because you can’t see the images everyone is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzvxYs"&gt;Christy Smith Berman, a low vision editor at Can I Play That, responded to a TT Games tweet that announced the delay of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Lego&lt;/em&gt; with text on an image. When she replied with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepuppiesNpink/status/1377987541870243843"&gt;request for alt text&lt;/a&gt;, Smith Berman was met with responses from people expressing disbelief that blind people would even be on Twitter to begin with, let alone care about video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPr53L"&gt;Those false assumptions often mean that people are left out of fun cultural moments on social media. Memes usually involve rapidly evolving iterations of undescribed images with tiny words in weird fonts. Viral videos are reposted and shared without any kind of description, through audio or text, of what’s happening on-screen. “Oh, that must be somebody dancing,” thinks McCann when she encounters a TikTok with no audio besides music. “Well, no, it’s actually somebody making a cheesesteak. But I didn’t know that because there’s no audio indication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1J2rQ"&gt;“A lot of the memes that people share, they don’t add alt text to it,” says Steven Aquino, a legally blind journalist. Aquino doesn’t use a screen reader, instead relying on magnification, but he’s still sometimes left wondering what’s going on in memes. “It’s really hard because I can’t see so well, and I just feel like, ‘Okay, it’s supposed to be funny, but I can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGwgYM"&gt;Beyond a simple neglect of accessibility features, conveying visual humor through text isn’t something everyone has a knack for. The funniest images rely on comedic timing through careful visual composition, prior knowledge of a specific meme, or familiarity with several different cultural references. Writing an image description for an esoteric meme can feel like explaining internet culture to your grandparents: you suddenly don’t know how to describe what exactly made you laugh. The complicated nature of meme literacy isn’t something we can blame on platforms — it’s just not something the average person is used to putting into words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqKMu"&gt;But there are other less complicated factors that can impact the online experiences of people who are blind or have low vision. Aquino points out that people will use special unicode characters in their Twitter display names that are harder to read and aren’t interpreted as letters by screen reading software. A screen reader isn’t technically incorrect if it reads a character as “mathematical bold capital,” but most sighted people will read it simply as a letter with different formatting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qslmkH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You       it's    ℯ to       your tweets and usernames         . But have you          to what it             with assistive technologies like          ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/CywCf1b3Lm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CywCf1b3Lm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083073242330361856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WinCPc"&gt;“For people that do use screen readers, this software is only so smart,” says Aquino. “So if you’ve got a clever name, your voiceover or whatever it is that you use is going to fail.” Tweets that include rows of emojis, or a lot of special characters to create an image or convey cursive script, can be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ieAkh6rMARc"&gt;hellish to listen to&lt;/a&gt; when they’re read by a screen reader. Posting a screenshot of the tweet with alt text is a workable alternative, but people rarely know to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRaKBL"&gt;McCann is glad that many sites have improved their accessibility options over the years, but she wishes they were more widely used and wonders why they aren’t better promoted. TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/accessibility/en-us/"&gt;text to speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;warns people&lt;/a&gt; when flashing effects in their videos might trigger seizures, so why can’t all social sites have better prompts for encouraging users to add captions, visual descriptions, and alt text? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8MLce"&gt;“The onus is on the disability community to educate,” she says. “Why isn’t there more education from these mainstream companies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU0uVJ"&gt;McCann wishes it were easier for her to join the party when things like TikTok videos go viral. “Unless I have someone sit with me and explain to me what’s going on, I definitely feel like I can’t have a conversation about it with someone,” she says. “It is exclusionary to a point, because I like jokes. I like pasta recipes. I want to know that stuff! I’m still a part of the social fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RIgILf"&gt;
&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js" type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script&gt;$(".c-entry-hero__image").html('&lt;style&gt;.vrg-video-lede {max-width: 800px;margin: 0 auto;} .vrg-label {height: 1px;width: 1px;overflow: hidden;position: absolute;} .vrg-inner-container {height: 100%; position: relative;padding-bottom: 100%;overflow: hidden;}@media screen and (max-width:768px){.vrg-inner-container {height: 100%;}} .vrg-media {position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;width: 100%;height: 100%;} .vrg-media img {height: 100%;width: 100%;max-width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;} .vrg-media video {height: 100%;width: 100%;position: absolute;top: 0;left: 0;object-fit: cover;display: inline-block;}&lt;/style&gt;&lt;figure class="vrg-video-lede" aria-label="media" role="group"&gt;&lt;span class="vrg-label"&gt;Video&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-inner-container"&gt;&lt;div class="vrg-media"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22749302/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.jpg" alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right."&gt;&lt;video src="https://volume-assets.voxmedia.com/production/a848f8f12adea7db7f62510d854c986b/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_001.mp4" muted="" loop="" autoplay="" playsinline=""&gt;&lt;/video&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;');&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk calls Apple’s App Store fees a ‘de facto global tax on the Internet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 46" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8qmgti1mlml3NmF5TTdl1BeUAU=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657521/1232778207.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WC23UO"&gt;Elon Musk has had a busy Friday on Twitter. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;flatly denying that he has ever spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; in response to a wild story alleging he demanded to take over as the company’s CEO as part of an acquisition offer, Musk has now tweeted his support of Epic Games’ fight against Apple over App Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypPcEN"&gt;“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tgM4kg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmbDWB"&gt;Epic is currently embroiled in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that its App Store rules, which allow Apple to take a 30 percent commission on many transactions on the App Store, are unfair and anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiXz6b"&gt;Perhaps aiming to take advantage of the massive spotlight Musk is bringing to the fight by tweeting about it to his 58.7 million followers, CEO Tim Sweeney, who has been a vocal opponent of Apple on Twitter, posted his latest salvo against the iPhone maker just 25 minutes after Musk’s tweet. “In the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567"&gt;Sweeney said&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple must be stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nhEBpM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Apple Tax is far more pernicious than many realize. “It only applies to digital goods accessible on iOS”, they say — but in the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce. Apple must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O2V"&gt;Apple has not replied to a request for comment. Epic pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTt2vb"&gt;Epic faced off with Apple in court for much of the month of May, and while we’re still awaiting a verdict on the lawsuit, the trial itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;revealed all sorts of interesting information&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;an antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; over Play Store policies, though that case is moving more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnkh7y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:28PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that Epic pointed us to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Apple deny wild story that he tried to replace Tim Cook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla CEO Elon Musk Testifies In SolarCity Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PB8X5BB1v1lSmOKT3NMpA6tkUZE=/0x0:5167x3445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657090/1233956452.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6GRyd"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly demanded to become Apple’s CEO in a 2016 phone call with current Apple CEO Tim Cook, according to an upcoming book about Tesla. The story, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century-ebook/dp/B08MQ4KWWR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Tim Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J05FIO"&gt;As the book tells it, Cook suggested to Musk that Apple acquire Tesla, and Musk said he wanted to be CEO. Cook reportedly agreed, but Musk clarified that he wanted to be the CEO of Apple. “According to a former aide who heard (Musk’s) retelling of the exchange,” Cook said “Fuck you” before hanging up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3B4B3"&gt;But Musk and Apple have both suggested that the conversation couldn’t have happened because Musk and Cook have never spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMiQC5"&gt;Musk, in a tweet on Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112"&gt;flat out said that&lt;/a&gt; “Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.” He also said that he attempted to meet with Cook about Apple acquiring Tesla, a meeting that Cook refused. (Musk previously discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;this attempted meeting in December&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpC1X4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saX9fM"&gt;When asked for comment about the reported conversation, Apple pointed to remarks Cook made during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; Kara Swisher where he denied having ever spoken to Elon. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;Cook said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXM0qp"&gt;Musk also claims that much of the book is false. “Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458"&gt;Musk said in a tweet on Friday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QTfPhv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring   &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gG8JnF"&gt;And Musk apparently tried to dash cold water on the book while it was being written, telling Higgins that much of the book was “nonsense,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="InHm3k"&gt;Musk apparently did not participate in the creation of “Power Play.” In an author’s note at the end, Higgins writes that Musk “was given numerous opportunities to comment on the stories, facts, and characterizations presented in these pages. Without pointing to any specific inaccuracies, he offered simply this: ‘Most, but not all, of what you read in this book is nonsense.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpddym"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512"&gt;Higgins says&lt;/a&gt; that Musk had “plenty of opportunities” to comment and that the story of the conversation with Cook “comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time.” In an earlier tweet, he also characterized the story of Musk and Cook’s conversation &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?s=21"&gt;as one that was&lt;/a&gt; “told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is facing a subpoena for millions of documents in Google’s antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2Mk6w1XOp2h85tl1TBikvV0bgc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656859/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7bYHJu"&gt;The sweeping federal antitrust case against Google has given rise to a significant fight over data held by Microsoft, and the company is now facing a subpoena for millions of documents that could shed light on its attempts to compete with Google’s search engine. Having initially cooperated with prosecutors in building an antitrust case against Google, Microsoft could be obligated to produce millions more documents at the request of Google’s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwFB3H"&gt;At a status hearing on Friday morning, Judge Amit Mehta heard arguments from both Google and Microsoft on the issue, but ultimately found more information was required before the court could give guidance as to how much internal data Microsoft would be required to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtQ38e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M62YXy"&gt;“These are hard issues for any judge to resolve in a way that’s objective and meaningful,” Mehta told attorneys, “and that’s particularly so given that, with respect to the additional custodians, I don’t have any sense of the volume that would produce … or what that volume would mean for the timing of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZTnd6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws"&gt;Filed in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google focuses on anti-competitive behavior in search and search advertising, alleging among other claims that the company’s exclusivity agreements on Android and iOS shut out competing search engines. Separate antitrust cases against Google have also been filed focusing on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;browser privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;alleged manipulation of search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J1V9J"&gt;In advance of the Department of Justice filing charges, Microsoft provided more than 400,000 documents to civil investigative demands from prosecutors. In a filing before today’s hearing, Google &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21020163-google-microsoft-subpoena-compliance"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that participation entitles the company to a similar range of documents that might be helpful to its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zdCpz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case,” says Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3Ii7K"&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft. The DOJ and Colorado Complaints refer to it or its products dozens of times,” Google’s filing reads. “Having so obviously pressed for and cooperated in the preparation of the present Complaints to be filed against Google, Microsoft cannot credibly avoid significant discovery in these cases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2vR7"&gt;Google first issued a subpoena to Microsoft in April, seeking “older documents that will shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully on the merits.” But Microsoft agreed to only eight of the 27 executives to be searched, and drastically limited the search strings to which they would be subject. Google is now asking for a more powerful court order to compel the production of documents from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP43v"&gt;In an appendix to its filing, Google listed 19 current and former Microsoft executives who may hold communications relevant to the case, including former Windows Phone chief Andrew Lees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/12/4515830/terry-myerson-microsoft-windows-reorganization"&gt;former Windows head Terry Myerson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcIXV"&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case: the development and distribution of Microsoft’s various search engines, Microsoft’s search advertising business, and Microsoft’s effort to market devices that would give it yet more search access points beyond the ever-present Windows desktop,” the filing reads. “Google simply seeks discovery commensurate with Plaintiffs’ allegations, which reach back two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drctt9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/169/united-states-of-america-v-google-llc/"&gt;In its own filing&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pushed back against this logic, arguing Google is filing unnecessarily broad requests in an effort to additionally delay the case. “In the past nine days, in fact, Google has proposed seventeen&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;additional custodians,” Microsoft’s filing claims, “including nine on July 19, five on July 26, and three today, July 27. Google has not explained why it believes searching these additional twenty-eight custodians ... is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVYq9s"&gt;Weighing the two arguments, the court seemed to slightly favor Google’s side of the case, but ultimately asked for more data on the burden required to produce the documents. “The description of the people [Google has] identified as additional custodians certainly struck me as not reaching,” Judge Mehta said, “and I haven’t heard Microsoft say today that there’s minimal chance that they’re likely to have records at all that are responsive and relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7QOM"&gt;However, the court ultimately found there was insufficient information about the burden posed by production, and the dispute is likely to continue at least until August 20th, the deadline set for further filings on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kh5UE"&gt;“The best I can do for you today is to give you a deadline by which to get back to me with concrete information,” Judge Mehta told the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUtgj"&gt;The finding is one more turn in what is likely to be a long and contentious discovery period for the antitrust case. Microsoft says it believes the first phase of its own document production will last until at least October of this year. Trial proceedings for &lt;em&gt;US v. Google&lt;/em&gt; are scheduled to begin on September 12th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCBFsH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Government denies Blue Origin’s challenge to NASA’s lunar lander program</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bbrulx"&gt;The Government Accountability Office squashed Blue Origin’s protest over NASA’s decision to pick a single lunar lander contractor, the agency said Friday, also denying a similar protest from Dynetics. The GAO’s decision keeps Blue Origin’s rival, Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the sole winner of NASA’s lucrative Moon lander program and hands a loss to Jeff Bezos, whose space company waged a months-long fight to win the same funding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BIsuxy"&gt;In formal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; filed in April, Bezos’ Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics accused NASA of running afoul of contracting law when the agency shelved their proposals and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;gave Musk’s SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; a lone $2.9 billion contract to build the country’s first human lunar lander in decades and land a crew on the Moon by 2024. NASA had said it could award up to two companies for the contract, but never committed to that number, and went with SpaceX’s Starship proposal. The GAO found that NASA “reserved the right to make multiple awards, a single award, or no award at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ni91Fo"&gt;Musk responded to the news by tweeting “GAO” with a flexing bicep emoji.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vif1gO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;GAO  &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421155803223011333?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9mCex1"&gt;In picking only SpaceX, NASA said it did what it could with the funding it had from Congress. Lawmakers gave NASA a quarter of the roughly $3 billion it requested for its astronaut Moon lander program. In its protest, Blue Origin said NASA should’ve called off the program or retooled it when the agency realized it wouldn’t have had enough money to fund two contractors. But the GAO rejected that argument, saying “there was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement as a result of the amount of funding available for the program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJATLC"&gt;Blue Origin and Dynetics’ loss at the GAO lifts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;the three-month procedural hold&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s contract, which was put in place as the GAO adjudicated Blue Origin’s protest. That’s good news for NASA’s fast-paced Artemis program, which still calls for landing a crew of astronauts on the Moon by 2024, with several crewed missions after that. NASA has said it plans to open up future lunar transportation contract programs that other companies, including those who lost to SpaceX, can compete for. But Blue Origin has said that SpaceX, as the sole winner of the first contract, would have an unfair advantage over other potential bidders for those future awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QfpJp3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0IzTIv"&gt;“We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction,” a Blue Origin spokesperson said in a statement. If it decides to, the company could bring its grievances to the US Court of Federal Claims, the only other legal arena for bid disputes. “We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution... The Human Landing System program needs to have competition now instead of later – that’s the best solution for NASA and the best solution for our country,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hb3DDo"&gt;Blue Origin’s proposal for the NASA program was for its $6 billion Blue Moon lunar lander, which the company is building with a “National Team” of subcontractors that includes Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594038/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-nasa-lunar-lander-2-billion"&gt;Bezos personally offered&lt;/a&gt; to discount the cost of the Blue Moon lander by up to $2 billion. He said in an open letter to NASA administrator Bill Nelson that such an offer would “bridge the HLS budgetary funding shortfall” and “get the program back on track right now.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6QVg6"&gt;That offer still stands, a Blue Origin spokesperson said, adding: “We’re talking with NASA about next steps and appropriate actions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u4fm0R"&gt;NASA said the GAO ruling in its favor allows the agency and SpaceX to come up with a timeline for landing humans on the Moon. It wasn’t immediately clear whether NASA still expects SpaceX to meet the 2024 deadline after the 95-day delay caused by the protest, but it said it’s “moving forward with urgency” while keeping safety during Starship’s development a priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLCe8S"&gt;The first two Artemis missions are still on track, NASA said. The first will be uncrewed. For the second Artemis mission, astronauts will take a trip around the Moon and back aboard the agency’s Orion capsule, without landing. The third mission will involve a landing with SpaceX’s Starship, which will ferry astronauts from Orion down to the lunar surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoyjyK"&gt;“As soon as possible, NASA will provide an update on the way ahead for Artemis, the human landing system, and humanity’s return to the Moon,” NASA said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFEnvS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th 5:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds a statement from NASA and background on the agency’s first two Artemis missions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The special effects behind Loki’s doomed planet of Lamentis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MrvmiO2Djk8NzyAFyADQTu1eaA=/714x0:3126x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656723/LMT2640_103_comp_v031_20210609_r709.1068_R_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How the team at Digital Domain destroyed a world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="p3n7Ok"&gt;When special effects studio Digital Domain was approached by Marvel to work on an episode of &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Floki%2F6pARMvILBGzF&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeLokiSpecialEffects073021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;/a&gt; there was one sequence in particular that was exciting: the chance to destroy an entire planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6onOR"&gt;The third episode of the series is set on the moon of a planet called Lamentis, which is about to collapse on itself, taking the moon with it. As Loki and Sylvie wander the desolate, purple landscape, meteors pound the ground around them. This all leads up to a crescendo when they reach a small town, which is battered by debris as the planet rips apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAmVl1"&gt;Even before he had any idea about the rest of the show, or how the story would play out, VFX supervisor Jean-Luc Dinsdale knew that this would be an important moment for &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;. “It was pretty clear from the start that this was a huge sequence and a big milestone for the series,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Technically, it’s a really challenging sequence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHD7Lg"&gt;Prior to that point, most of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; was set inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22574400/loki-retro-hardware-tempad-kasra-farahani-interview-marvel-disney-plus"&gt;the retrofuturistic hallways of the Time Variance Authority&lt;/a&gt;, which made the shift to Lamentis all the more jarring. When Loki and Sylvie first step outside on the moon, viewers are greeted to a grim, dirty landscape that looks like nothing else on the show — though that wasn’t always the plan. According to Dinsdale, the teams at Marvel Studios and Digital Domain played around with a few ideas for the planet and its moon, including a lush world covered in greenery, and another dominated by massive oceans. At one point they considered having a planet with a molten core that would create quite the spectacle when it finally imploded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5khVfu"&gt;“We explored that for a bit, but after a while the decision was made to make it more of a dead planet, a planet that had been mined to a crazy extent and basically had died through all of the exploitation,” Dinsdale explains. “So we ended up literally with this dead husk of a planet, that, as you can see in the final footage, has mining holes all over it and has really been ravaged to the point that there’s nothing left to it. Which I think explains why it imploded; the core of the planet got mined, and there’s no structural integrity so it falls apart.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lieCZ-1Ps-uz3TTAI6m0WTcVDy0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750937/LCL1000_103_TRL_comp_v042_r709_UHD.1012_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gINiwQ94OhJmuzyMrCQ06eOGvyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750966/ARC_103_10587_R_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBavPAql711-YAAOcP_O77xJdqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22750961/ARC_103_09262_R2_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPn8R0"&gt;That decision ties into the way Dinsdale likes to approach VFX, which is to base them in reality. Sure, none of us have ever seen a planet explode and take a populated moon with it, but the idea is that, with a grounding in real physics, this outlandish visual can be more believable. In addition to looking at lots of reference material, the team used software called Houdini to simulate how the explosion would happen, right down to the amount of dust and debris that would appear. “In my experience, the best way to approach visual effects is to base it on reality,” says Dinsdale. “What is the reason for this planet to be exploding? We always walk this fine line of what makes sense and what looks really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="yIVkyj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10677788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NucFsJ"&gt;This also ties into some of the world-building going on in the episode. The purple-hued moon of Lamentis is not a very welcoming place, and viewers learn this largely through the visuals. The miners left on the planet wear shabby clothes, and the few buildings look weathered and beaten. The team at Digital Domain was able to expand on this not just through the landscape, which is largely barren, but also the equipment seen in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IvcdI"&gt;“The production [team] really wanted to give the sense that they had been mining for a while,” says Dinsdale. “The mining equipment on this planet is dilapidated, it’s been used for a very long time, and it’s not like it’s super high-tech. To me it was similar to James Cameron’s &lt;em&gt;Aliens&lt;/em&gt;, the design aesthetic where there’s nothing fancy about this planet, therefore it’s dirty and used and dusty.” Much of this involved the labor-intensive process of adding lots of extra detail to everything, whether it’s dents in a spaceship or layers of dirt on some mining equipment. “You don’t necessarily see all of those individual details, but just this buildup of detail creates the sense that this thing looks real.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dq7jM6"&gt;The effects studio worked on the show for about a year and a half, and eventually contributed more than 300 VFX shots. One of the challenges was that, despite lasting just 43 minutes, the episode cycles through many different and varied tones. At the beginning it’s like a chase sequence, as Loki and Sylvie run to escape the meteors raining down on the surface. Later, things are much more subdued as the pair have quiet, heartfelt conversations while the world is crumbling around them. This all culminates in that big final sequence when the town is destroyed. And all of these moments required something different in terms of special effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="IT52Or"&gt;“We need the meteors to be scary, we need them to have a lot of velocity and huge impacts, debris flying everywhere, to create that sense of jeopardy,” Dinsdale says of that early chase sequence. “But later on in the show, as they’re walking towards the mining town, the filmmakers wanted the threat of the meteors to still be there, that’s why you’re always seeing them in the background. But a different look was created to give the sense that, yes the meteors are always there, there’s always a bit of jeopardy, but it’s not the big Michael Bay moment where they’re about to be crushed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZlJV8"&gt;These sections also proved to be challenging from the VFX side because of how they were filmed. During the action sequences, real debris was thrown around on set in order to give the actors something to respond to. It made for more true-to-life acting, but as Dinsdale explains, “that makes work for us a lot harder, because we have to go in and remove the stuff that was dropped on set, replace the backgrounds, and then layer back in debris to bring that sense of danger back. Even though it’s more work for us on the backend, the results are much more satisfactory. You end up with a pretty amazing look.” He adds that “the amount of cleaning up that had to be done to the footage was extensive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="wMad0B"&gt;The amount of work involved was similar to that of a feature-length film, and the result is arguably the most visually striking of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;’s six episodes. From its harsh color scheme to its desolate vibe, Lamentis really doesn’t look like anything else in the series — which is what makes it so memorable. “We basically got to create our own little world separate from the rest of the show,” says Dinsdale.&lt;/p&gt;
