    <title>Apple Music’s spatial audio and lossless streaming are now available on Android</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEEq4hgQe0J1hx7btXgB9fEu1TQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622020/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Az5rUL"&gt;Apple Music listeners on Android can now take advantage of the Dolby Atmos spatial audio and lossless-quality streaming features that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;debuted on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS&lt;/a&gt; over a month ago. The latest update of the app for Android adds support for both features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UUoqv"&gt;Lossless should be available pretty universally on Android devices. Apple includes all the same warnings as on iOS about it consuming “significantly more data.” Like on Apple’s own platforms, Apple Music advises that external hardware like a DAC is required if you want to step up to hi-res lossless. (I’m curious whether this still applies on LG’s audiophile-friendly phones, which have an excellent built-in DAC, but haven’t had the chance to test yet.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xMQl1h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Music’s spatial audio is sometimes amazing but mostly inconsistent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="H6fzOe"&gt;Spatial audio support on the Android side seems a more limited, however. Although the feature works with any headphones — just like on iPhone — Apple notes that your phone itself needs to support Dolby Atmos to enable spatial audio. On my Pixel 4A 5G, there’s no option for “Dolby Atmos” in the audio section of Apple Music’s settings. Other colleagues with more flagship-tier devices have a toggle for Atmos there. So I guess that’s the easiest way to tell whether your phone is capable of spatial audio playback. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4YuHP"&gt;The beta version of Apple Music for Android actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436575/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3"&gt;tipped off&lt;/a&gt; that lossless and hi-res audio were coming to the service even before Apple made an official announcement. But now both are available on the regular Apple Music app for Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM3 cost less than ever at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sony WH-1000XM3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qm1L5QV7GPedzu71laHN9Xgtk50=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69622012/jbareham_180823_2895_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2c0FQB"&gt;It’s sometimes easy to dismiss the previous generation of a product in favor of the latest version. In most cases, that’s smart to do, unless a deal is just too good to pass up. Case in point, Sony’s WH-1000XM3 noise-canceling headphones that released in 2018 are down to their lowest price yet at Best Buy today and through Sunday. Originally $350 (but usually selling between $220-$270 most days), &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get them new in the black colorway for $170&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon was offering this price earlier today, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G4MNFS1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it appears to have sold out&lt;/a&gt; for the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo5C9c"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1000XM4 that released in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the XM3s aren’t far behind. They are comparable in terms of sound quality, battery life, comfort, and with their noise cancellation effect. Though, the XM4 are unique in that they have an auto on / off playback sensor when you put on or take off the headphones, and they can connect with two Bluetooth sources simultaneously. We’ve seen that newer model go for as low as $250 during Prime Day recently, but you’d currently be able to buy two sets of XM3s at Best Buy to match the XM4’s price as it stands today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZCCH3D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiSbs"&gt;Also part of &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024753714194232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy’s three-day “Black Friday in July” sale&lt;/a&gt;, MSI’s Sword 15 gaming laptop is a couple hundred dollars off its normal price. Normally $1,200, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024670748190489#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $1,000 now&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not a bad deal for what specs are inside, including the Intel Core i7-11800H processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423474/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-60fps-gaming-laptops-features-specs-performance-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip&lt;/a&gt;, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and 8GB of RAM. It has a 1080p display with a 144Hz refresh rate. The sum of its components equal a solid midrange gaming laptop that should be capable of delivering playable frame rates in many games after some tweaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mX1ul7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10665627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt8QaL"&gt;We featured a similar deal recently for the newly released &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch, but the cartridge version of the game &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747024806913770606#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $9 off at Best Buy right now&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t extend to the digital version, but the discount is nice if you were thinking about grabbing this game at your local Best Buy ahead of the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jQ5zIi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso doesn’t need surprise to be good in season 2</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MM0cHWUBShm0GP1FiHJZshn2YLo=/186x0:5747x3707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621972/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020112.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BaoNPq"&gt;TV’s nicest guy is back, as &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; and its eponymous, eternally optimistic American football coach-turned-English Premier League gaffer (played by a golden-hearted Jason Sudeikis) returns for a second season on Apple TV Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLyasR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; season 1 and the first episode of season 2 ahead.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Uc-Txgz3oKkkE2A9JcIgvI2BrVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735340/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020106.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JzxbJN"&gt;The good news: the second season is off to an excellent start, picking up a few months after the crushing loss and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotion_and_relegation"&gt;relegation&lt;/a&gt; of the fictional Richmond team down to the second-tier Championship. But unlike season 1, the new episodes don’t have the benefit of being a pleasant surprise — season 2 has been hyped up for months, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;including a spotlight slot&lt;/a&gt; at one of Apple’s tech events alongside a new iPhone announcement. Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vy7Yxl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Season 2 has &lt;em&gt;expectations&lt;/em&gt; now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qVqHon"&gt;Unlike the first season, which largely focused on the soccer-ignorant Ted working to win over his skeptical team, the new season has the Richmond crew already on his side, even as they still struggle to actually succeed on the pitch. And it’s that climb back to sporting success that appears to be a major point of the new season, something that even Ted’s endless enthusiasm might not be able to solve on its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Hjuk"&gt;New in the second season is Sarah Niles (&lt;em&gt;I May Destroy You&lt;/em&gt;) as Sharon, a sports psychologist brought in to help the Richmond players, who represents a cooler, more professional take on self-improvement than Ted’s warm and fuzzy persona. It’s an interesting dynamic that should be fun to see progress throughout the season. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ExOJDi6P8NlB7OnmgLgLubq6CmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735343/Ted_Lasso_Photo_020101.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xKaW1n"&gt;But the most encouraging thing from &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is just how well the show continues to work, at least so far. The first season of the show, rather improbably based on some old NBC Sport commercials, came seemingly out of nowhere last summer, before slowly snowballing into Apple TV Plus’ most unexpected hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NuoGM"&gt;The show debuted on the service with more of a whimper than a bang, before word-of-mouth and its undeniably charming cast of underdogs managed to turn the similarly   underdog series into Apple’s flagship series, complete with a bevy of Emmy nominations and awards to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wEDcU"&gt;There were some concerns that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success could have been a flash in the pan, a combination of a highly bingeable show, Apple’s extended free trials for TV Plus, and a jaded populace just looking for something optimistic and upbeat after the relentless terribleness of 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ut9zYh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ted Lasso’s success is more than just a fad&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C1PLyS"&gt;Season 2, however, shows that &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s success is more than just a fad. The show’s brand of goodness (which continues to avoid tilting over into cloying early in the second season) is, if not always relatable, at least aspirational. The show’s cast of characters ultimately feel human, and it’s hard not to root for them to succeed, whether at soccer or at just being better people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsuUIC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s biggest challenge still lies ahead, though. The show returns for its second season today, with just a single episode, and will break the usual mold for streaming shows by debuting new episodes weekly for the next 12 weeks on Apple’s streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoHuW8"&gt;Coupled with the fact that Apple’s service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394404/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-july-2021-ted-lasso-second-season-timing"&gt;just ended its free trial&lt;/a&gt; for all of its earliest subscribers, Ted won’t have to just win over a bunch of gruff footballers — he’ll have to get viewers to shell out Apple’s $5 per month subscription until October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ffdvO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches Intrinsic: a new company to build software for industrial robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5dKSvYCeFazZDQFsWCNB9ew51Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621955/intrinsic_green_purple_center.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fM3Tak"&gt;Google’s parent-company Alphabet has a birth to announce: a new company called Intrinsic which will focus on building software for industrial robots. The subsidiary will be one of Alphabet’s “other bets” — relatively speculative firms focusing on new technology like Waymo (self-driving cars), Wing (delivery drones), and Verily (healthcare and biotech). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IOky"&gt;Details on what exactly Intrinsic is building or who its customers will be are unclear. A &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the company’s new CEO, Wendy Tan White, discusses Intrinsic’s ambitions in broad terms, saying it will “unlock the creative and economic potential of industrial robotics for millions more businesses, entrepreneurs, and developers” by creating software that will make deploying industrial robots “easier to use, less costly and more flexible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Gi1jk"&gt;Robotics have been an obsession at Google for years, but the company’s efforts have been unfocused and have yet to produce any commercial hits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WToLvo"&gt;In 2013, Google went on a shopping spree for robots, buying seven companies in roughly six months, including Schaft (a Japanese firm known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/26/5846550/google-pulls-its-all-star-robot-out-of-military-competition-to-focus"&gt;bipedal bots&lt;/a&gt;), Bot &amp;amp; Dolly (makers of &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lX6JcybgDFo"&gt;very cool viral videos&lt;/a&gt;), and Boston Dynamics (which needs no introduction). The effort was named “Replicant” and headed by Andy Rubin, an executive who co-founded the Android mobile operating system. Over the years, though, no news emerged from Replicant, and Google either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15766434/alphabet-google-boston-dynamics-softbank-sale-acquisition-robotics"&gt;sold off&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18096469/google-robotics-schaft-japanese-bipedal-shut-down"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; most of its acquisitions. Why? Partly because robots are hard to make and not very profitable. But also because of Rubin’s departure from the company in 2014 after being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;accused of sexual misconduct&lt;/a&gt; (which Google kept secret). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-lL5-y1RIs060Lg66xcmIYuo-xA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735338/ezgif.com_gif_maker.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google wants to use AI to teach robots how to move and work. In the video above, two Kuka industrial robotic arms assemble a box. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iASNk2"&gt;Since Replicant’s failure, the company has focused more on the software side of things, using machine learning to teach robots to manipulate objects without direct supervision. This plays to Google’s strengths and will apparently be Intrinsic’s focus going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmVQdG"&gt;“Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications,” writes Tan White in the blog post. “[W]e’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="967EJF"&gt;More than that, we don’t really know. Though it’s worth noting it’s not the only robotics effort at Google right now. In 2019, the company made a splash in announcing its Everyday Robot project: an effort housed in the company’s tech incubator X to develop a “general-purpose learning robot.” What’s happened to this project is unclear, and clicking the link on its &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/everyday-robots/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; to “read more” only directs you to a launch blog post, unchanged since 2019. Perhaps Intrinsic will have better luck in keeping Google’s attention.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evernote works to keep current users and tries for new ones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vacYEO4yYT8ziM8XFvivDi8ePw=/70x0:571x334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621828/Evernote_Logo_1200_640x334.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Evernote&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m4DOMv"&gt;It can take a lot of work for an app like &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/"&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first major note-taking apps to hit the market, to survive in an ever-changing and fickle marketplace. In an effort to keep its place at (or at least near) the top of its niche, Evernote has recently announced new price plans and features. Will these new features — and new fees — help it keep loyal users and encourage new ones? It’s hard to say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3eWyF"&gt;First, some personal history: I’ve been an Evernote user — well, seemingly forever. Forever when it comes to the life span of apps, anyway; I’ve had an Evernote account since May 2008, when it was about to go into open beta; I used it to make notes &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2478803/hands-on--evernote-offers-hope-for-packrats.html"&gt;for the review I was writing&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve had Evernote on my devices ever since — and although I haven’t used it nearly as much recently as I used to, I have a lot of history recorded in the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5f90Zq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’ve been an Evernote user — well, seemingly forever&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sINz1X"&gt;Evernote has gone through some changes, some good, some not so much. In 2008, it offered what at the time was an innovative service: a place where you could type in or upload notes, organize them into folders, and try to get your online life into some kind of order. Over the years, it had added a number of good features, such as a web clipper, an improved ability to pick up text from photos, and many others. By 2011 it was &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/2508496/try-to-remember%E2%80%94evernote-vs%E2%80%94springpad.html"&gt;available in two versions&lt;/a&gt;: an ad-supported free version with some limitations and a $45 / year subscription with no ads and additional features. In June 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3089500/evernote-changes-its-pricing-plans-and-users-worry.html"&gt;prices went up&lt;/a&gt;, and the free version could only be synced to two devices, a limitation that alarmed quite a few of its previously faithful users and no doubt caused a number to move to other apps. At the time, I thought seriously about moving on; but in the end, I bit the bullet and subscribed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAvFOV"&gt;By 2019, Evernote had also weathered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/16/13979778/evernote-privacy-policy-opt-out"&gt;a brief privacy upheaval&lt;/a&gt;, among other issues. I wrote, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18264368/evernote-notes-how-to-move-migrate-onenote-zoho-notebook-simplenote"&gt;an article on Evernote alternatives&lt;/a&gt;, “Evernote’s reputation has suffered due to an aging interface, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12052056/evernote-price-changes-basic-plus-premium"&gt;increased fees&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/18/evernote-just-slashed-54-jobs-or-15-percent-of-its-workforce/"&gt;a series of layoffs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/blog/ian-small-new-ceo/"&gt;a new CEO&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Os82eS"&gt;But despite everything, Evernote is still here, and now it has added several new features (including a long-overdue task listing) and has once again revamped its price structure. The company has apparently learned from at least some of its mistakes; a few days before the new prices went into effect, I received an email that assured me that, as a current subscriber, I was grandfathered into my subscription level and that my annual subscription price would not change. In other words, Evernote doesn’t intend to piss off its established users yet again.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Evernote’s new homepage is well-designed and useful." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UlDlC1ck6xJE0221xUu-kQm0vc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734276/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.41.21_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Evernote’s new homepage is well-designed and useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hASSa4"&gt;Admittedly, many of the app’s recent changes — some of which came through earlier this year, and some of which are brand-new — are quite good ones, adding new functionality while trying to fix the perception that the application has become top-heavy. A customizable and attractive homepage now gives you a quick view of your most recent notes and can also include a scratch pad, pinned notes or notebooks, the new task listing, and a calendar. The calendar allows you to handily associate notes with dates on your Google Calendar (Outlook is next in line). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGLmgq"&gt;However, which of these features you can access depends on what type of subscription you have. Evernote now offers &lt;a href="https://evernote.com/compare-plans"&gt;four subscription levels&lt;/a&gt;: Free, Personal ($7.99 a month or $69.99 a year), Professional ($9.99 a month or $99.99 a year), or Teams ($14.99 per user per month). There is a significant difference between the free app and the Personal one — non-paying users can still only sync between two devices, cannot personalize their homepages, set due dates or reminders for tasks, or use the calendar feature. On the other hand, most of the features that an individual user would want to use are included at the Personal level; the Professional level adds more customization and other business-like upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s nice that Evernote has finally added a tasks manager..." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HecEvgA5tRL0WMwxogn02XCcxUQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734289/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.38.27_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s nice that Evernote has finally added a tasks manager...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="...but you need to be at the Personal level before you can use it effectively." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X1ijDsOv146wtmXilRKqjTaVIRg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22734290/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_10.39.47_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;...but you need to be at the Personal level before you can use it effectively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwomy6"&gt;As for me, I’m currently in the weird in-between limbo of one of Evernote’s long-term users. When Evernote’s latest changeover happened, I was at the Plus level (at an annual fee of about $38), so I still don’t have limits on how many devices I can sync, and I have a monthly upload limit of 1GB, which is more than the free version’s limit of 60MB but less than Personal’s 10GB. I also don’t have access to much of the really cool new stuff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZw6IH"&gt;So if you’re using the free version or, like me, are grandfathered into a less feature-filled version, is it worth the upgrade? Possibly. Evernote has a lot of competition these days. Several people I know have moved to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fonenote%2Fdigital-note-taking-app%3Fms.url%3Donenotecom%26rtc%3D1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s OneNote&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t have a lot of the restrictions that the free version of Evernote has. Free apps like &lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/notes"&gt;Apple Notes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://keep.google.com/"&gt;Google Keep&lt;/a&gt; have gotten a lot more useful over the years and might be good enough now for even some power users. There are also other interesting apps out there with vastly different formats that allow you to enter text and collect other types of data. (For example, I’ve been doing a lot of experimenting with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21261811/note-taking-app-notion-free-plan-personal-use-unlimited-blocks"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; lately.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RIy9t"&gt;My own decision is that, for now, I’m going to stick with Evernote (especially since I’ve just paid my annual fee), and work with the version I’ve got. It’s possible that I’ll decide eventually that I want all my notes and schedules and tasks integrated into one package, and will yield to Evernote’s frequent hints to upgrade. However, it’s more possible that I will continue to be happy using Evernote for some things and Notion (or another app) for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y96mIo"&gt;Whether I would do the same were I not already heavily invested in Evernote is a question that’s hard to answer. I still really like the app — I like its flexibility, its ability to save articles and sites on the fly, and its excellent search engine. But the free version remains unusable for anyone with more than a single computer and a phone, and with other alternatives out there, I’m not sure I’d splurge for the annual $70 fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi4918"&gt;As with most productivity apps, it all depends on what fits you — your needs, your working habits, and the way your brain works. If you’re looking for a way to save notes, clippings, and other data, I’d suggest you spend some time with Evernote, OneNote, &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/notebook/"&gt;Zoho Notebook&lt;/a&gt;, Google Keep, Apple Notes, Notion, or any of the many others that are out there, and see what suits you best. After all, that’s what free trials are for, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWIzXT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BC8pm9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Drive will let you block other users to stop potential harassment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8zRI_3V706zuixXzFquVN1CNZyo=/124x0:1476x901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621738/Blog_user_google_drive.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users can be blocked by right clicking on a file they’ve sent you.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xvNjbc"&gt;Google Drive is adding the ability for users to block other accounts from sharing files with them, in a move that’s designed to prevent potential harassment and spam on the platform. The feature, which is &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/block-shares-from-user-google-drive.html"&gt;rolling out over the next two weeks&lt;/a&gt;, also stops accounts from accessing any files you’ve shared with them in the past, and removes any of their past files from your drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cbJGRf"&gt;“Drive’s sharing capabilities fuel productivity and collaboration, but bad actors can abuse tools that are meant to facilitate helpful sharing,” Google’s announcement post says. “That’s why we are creating a way to block other users.” Blocking an account in Drive will also prevent them from interacting with you &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6388749#zippy=%2Cuse-drive-to-block-an-account"&gt;across other Google services&lt;/a&gt; like Hangouts and Chat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lzaHFqkcDQMHtdljabD2c0rDJq0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735279/block_user_drive_list.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block option as it appears in Drive’s context menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="syWyNL"&gt;The search giant announced the new feature &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/new-security-capabilities-for-google-workspace"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. It came after a &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/google-drive-harassment-remove-shared"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;highlighted an instance where a user was unable to remove a shared folder from an abusive ex-partner from their Drive. Because the folder contained innocuous photographs, Drive’s existing “report as abuse” feature wasn’t an appropriate response, and the service’s design made it difficult to permanently remove the files otherwise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHrGIV"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/10613533"&gt;Google’s support page&lt;/a&gt;, the option to block a user will appear if you right-click a file they’ve shared with you in Drive. There’s also an option to unblock users later if you change your mind. It’s an important admission that sharing features can easily be abused by bad actors, even when they’re a part of a service that’s not a traditional social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0kruU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGYWLN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the Green Screen effect on TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/51y2KwuzxSmlgPbWSqaCGdMQoB4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621591/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EiXu4T"&gt;Green screens used to be reserved for those with access to, well, a green screen. This method has been around for a long time: allowing creators to superimpose a photo or video onto a background in a film or video. Traditionally, that means using a setup that has a large sheet of (usually) green material behind the subject. The solid color makes it easy to digitally remove that color in post-production and add whatever image or video should be there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tiHGcQ"&gt;Now the idea of green screens has gone digital as a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21173608/zoom-video-conference-how-to-virtual-background-greenscreen"&gt;hide backgrounds in meetings&lt;/a&gt; or to create fun videos on social media. TikTok has taken this idea and run with it by creating an effect within the app that does basically the same thing. While not as polished as a traditional green screen, it still gets the job done and allows the creator to remain on-screen while showing the audience an image in the background of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sJrlyC"&gt;The effect is a great way to spice up a video and provide an interesting visual. I use it regularly on &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@verge?"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s TikTok&lt;/a&gt; so the audience can see whatever object or topic I’m discussing. Even though I usually rely on the basic green screen option, which adds a photo to the background, there are plenty of different effects to choose from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPkkKz"&gt;Here’s how you can do it in TikTok: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="szxdyH"&gt;Tap the + icon in the bottom center of the screen to create a new video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PAjHcF"&gt;Click “Effects” in the bottom left corner. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZuJgfE"&gt;Choose “Green Screen” from the menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WbhXph"&gt;Browse all of the Green Screen effects and decide which one best suits what you want to do with your video.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HhdS2PPfMFWwVtuwieZfSypJVns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733102/IMG_8204.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are a lot of different Green Screen effects to choose from.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoloqhSj1sCXnf5atSAH_y7bwKU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733109/IMG_8205.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever image you choose will become the background.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVDP0Q"&gt;The most common effects used are the simplest: they add a photo or video to the background that stays in place as the subject moves around the frame. But there are others that you can try that get pretty creative. You can add an image as a sticker that can be resized and moved around, or you can superimpose an image over your clothing to change your look. There’s even a feature to add parts of your face to a photo just in case, say, you want to pretend your dog can talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xv8Kup"&gt;The options are limitless once you use a little imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp29ZPXSmiXT_EKiMlla9CBpyvo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733122/IMG_8210.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Turn your pet into a terrifying creature using the face green screen effect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1s-jThhWpinQ86akGDST1Kiip2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733129/IMG_8211.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Change your outfit up using a photo or design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Communication around masks is still terrible  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hg878s1W4atqjwt3OIS3Bk1FZkA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621598/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2AWBkY"&gt;When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434645/vaccines-masks-social-distancing-cdc-covid"&gt;long-awaited guidelines&lt;/a&gt; in May for when vaccinated people could stop wearing masks, some experts cautioned that the changes were coming &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/17/997422911/cdc-criticized-for-confusing-updated-mask-recommendation"&gt;too soon&lt;/a&gt;. We were still learning more about the vaccine’s protection, and epidemiologists were worried about coronavirus variants. If mask rules were lifted and cases spiked again, reinstating them would be difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c41kyx"&gt;Well, cases are now rising again across the country in a Delta variant-fueled surge, and that’s making mask recommendations just as difficult to handle as people feared. The surge is most devastating in places with low vaccination rates, but it’s also hitting states and counties where most adults are vaccinated. So not long after lifting mask mandates, some places — like Los Angeles county — are &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-18/la-county-indoor-masks-will-people-follow-rule"&gt;reinstating them&lt;/a&gt;. The American Academy of Pediatrics split from the CDC’s guidance (unchanged since May) and is &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/all-children-should-wear-masks-school-fall-even-if-vaccinated-n1274358?cid=sm_npd_nn_tw_ma"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; that even vaccinated adolescents and teens wear masks in schools this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhcKlE"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1416812217492811777"&gt;conservative pushback&lt;/a&gt; to masking policies is back, too. The Los Angeles sheriff says he &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/world/los-angeles-sheriff-mask.html"&gt;won’t enforce&lt;/a&gt; the county’s mask mandate. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott says he won’t reimpose statewide masking. It would be “inappropriate to require people who already have immunity to wear a mask,” he &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/07/21/despite-rise-in-covid-19-cases-gov-greg-abbott-says-he-will-not-impose-another-mask-mandate-in-texas/?utm_source=facebook&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=snd&amp;amp;utm_content=kprc2"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;KPRC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="CZMPOg"&gt;People across the political spectrum are &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-18/la-county-indoor-masks-will-people-follow-rule"&gt;frustrated&lt;/a&gt; about the constantly changing direction. This whiplash and confusion is just the latest chapter in the mask communications drama that’s been going on for more than a year. Here in the US, there’s been poor public health messaging around face coverings from the very beginning of the pandemic. In April 2020, the White House and CDC first pivoted from telling people to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; wear masks to telling them to wear them. The inconsistency was bad for public trust, Rob Blair, an assistant professor of political science and international and public affairs at Brown University, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206728/cloth-face-masks-white-house-coronavirus-covid-cdc-messaging"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ufY8VQ"&gt;“What we have is inconsistent messaging, sometimes from the same source,” Blair said. “What we have is utter cacophony. That’s detrimental not only for the quality of the response, but for trust more generally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnABf5"&gt;Over a year later, we’re facing the same cacophony. It doesn’t help that the messaging is more complicated now that vaccines are widely available. Masks may not be as critical for vaccinated people if case rates are low, but they’re important where cases are high or rising — even though vaccinated people are protected from the worst of the disease. Kids under 12 are at lower risk from COVID-19 than adults, but they can’t be vaccinated yet, and masks are a big way to protect them. Faced with a confusing back-and-forth, people who gleefully threw out their masks may be reluctant to put them back on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j2Y9zX"&gt;“I think people will be disappointed that folks were having some hope and seeing the light at the end of the tunnel — and this would be a suggestion that we’re taking a step back,” Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/07/19/mask-mandates-returning/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tysx2"&gt;As jarring as it may be to start wearing masks in more places again, the fact is that they’re still one of the simplest ways to protect against the spread of this disease. There’s also no denying that they’re still a highly politicized culture war flashpoint. The early flubs by the CDC and the initial obstruction by the Trump White House set the foundation for the mask turmoil of the past year. Now, at a key juncture in the United States’ response to the pandemic, it’s just as messy and high-stakes as ever. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fly a drone? The FAA’s new TRUST test is easy — and mandatory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2CZlWRAfTaai8sJbiQ5BboQrn4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69621539/vpavic_201214_4405_0360.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ryan Loughlin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Every single recreational pilot in the US needs to take it ASAP&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="012Tqu"&gt;If you’ve flown a drone for fun in the USA anytime in the past month, chances are you were breaking the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="od63z9"&gt;That’s because on June 22nd, the FAA finally released a mandatory knowledge test every recreational pilot legally needs to complete. It’s called TRUST, short for The Recreational Unmanned Aircraft Systems Safety Test, and trust is the operative word since the FAA isn’t planning to start issuing $1,000+ fines right away. Authorities aren’t likely to stop you in the street. But they could. Legally, you now need to carry a test completion certificate to fly a drone for fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DCDl"&gt;The good news: The test is free, incredibly easy, teaches you the rules as you go, can be taken as many times as you want, and I’d be surprised if it takes you over 10 minutes to get a perfect score. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E8J0cP"&gt;After chatting with the FAA last week, here’s a brief FAQ we whipped up about the test, and most every other basic burning question about how to legally fly drones in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mjvfCQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I legally fly a drone in the US? TL;DR, please.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CHQRmX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If and only if&lt;/em&gt; you’re flying solely for fun, the federal government has a fairly small list of rules as of today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="M662lk"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://faadronezone.faa.gov/"&gt;Register your drone&lt;/a&gt; if it weighs more than 0.55 pounds (249g) and label your drone if so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Q8QPqT"&gt;Take the new mandatory test, and carry a copy of your completion certificate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BEILIL"&gt;Never let your drone out of your sight, unless you’ve got a buddy right next to you watching it the whole time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ll3Fjp"&gt;Never fly over 400 feet above ground level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rua0X2"&gt;Never fly in controlled airspace (typically near airports, but check &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/where_can_i_fly/b4ufly/"&gt;the B4UFLY app&lt;/a&gt;) without using the FAA’s electronic systems to get authorization first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ax99sS"&gt;Proactively stay away from any aircraft with an actual pilot; emergency response, law enforcement, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wv1XBt"&gt;Follow the safety guidelines of either the FAA or a “community-based organization.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GeuRad"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about flying at night, or over people, or into fireworks? Didn’t I hear those were all illegal? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVLLiv"&gt;You might have, and there may be &lt;em&gt;local&lt;/em&gt; laws you’ll still need to follow. For example, many stadiums, parks (and &lt;a href="https://www.nps.gov/articles/unmanned-aircraft-in-the-national-parks.htm"&gt;all US national parks&lt;/a&gt;) have a ban on drones, and some places (like the state of Tennessee) don’t let you fly through fireworks, either. California doesn’t let you fly over another person’s property to snap photos of them, to ward off paparazzi. Here are &lt;a href="https://jrupprechtlaw.com/drone-laws-state/"&gt;a couple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://uavcoach.com/drone-laws-california/"&gt;handy collections&lt;/a&gt; of drone laws by state. Most orgs also frown on flying under the influence, near power lines, or other dangerous behavior, and you’ll want to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/us/elegant-tern-eggs-drone-crash-california.html"&gt;stay &lt;em&gt;far&lt;/em&gt; away from protected wildlife.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UF9n3A"&gt;But flying at night, or over people? Those aren’t necessarily against federal law if you’re flying for fun — only if you’re making money with your drone under the FAA’s Part 107 instead. And even Part 107 pilots have been able to do those things &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/commercial_operators/operations_over_people/"&gt;since April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, as long as they follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;certain additional rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="037sm9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I never let a drone out of my sight if I’m flying it through my smartphone screen? Or an FPV headset?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJPAph"&gt;Yeah, I’ve had a pretty hard time with this myself. But it’s also something the FAA’s been pretty clear about for years — it expects you, or a “visual observer” right next to you, to be able to see the drone with your naked eye at all times. It’s known as the visual line of sight rule, or VLOS for short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xV7WP"&gt;It makes sense, because it’s still the best way to avoid mid-air collisions right now. Your FPV camera can only face forward, but your drone can move in any direction. And while pricey drones with ADS-B sensors can provide early warnings about manned aircraft, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22234029/faa-american-robotics-beyond-visual-line-of-sight-remote-observer-waiver"&gt;automatic sense-and-avoid is rare&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21009994/skydio-2-review-self-flying-autonomous-drone-camera-crash-proof-price"&gt;self-flying drones like Skydio&lt;/a&gt;, with cameras pointed every which way, aren’t generally programmed to dodge other aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2S8Hs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does that mean I’m breaking the law if I set a self-flying drone to “follow me” mode?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHNlcz"&gt;Technically, yes. The FAA says unless you’re looking backwards the whole time or have a visual observer following you, too, you’re not maintaining visual line of sight, and you don’t know if there are other aircraft your drone might hit (or that might hit your drone). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqOxwZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the test. Why do I have to immediately take a mandatory test I’ve never heard of before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5moaiH"&gt;It came as a surprise to me too! Technically, it was supposed to be here long ago. When Congress reauthorized the FAA’s authority in 2018, it carved out a new chunk of law to make it easier for people to fly drones for fun — as long as they passed an “aeronautical knowledge and safety test” that the agency had 180 days to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSZtMX"&gt;It’s been a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; longer than 180 days, but the test is here now, and the FAA is encouraging every single drone pilot to take it as soon as possible — and carry proof of completion with you. Unless you’ve got a fancier remote pilot certificate like Part 107, anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QLoMk4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What, is the FAA going to fine me if I don’t carry a card? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmV92Z"&gt;It absolutely could, even if it’s not terribly likely. The FAA says it’s not like they’re out there writing tickets, and the goal is education. If you aren’t familiar with the law and don’t have a certificate to show, the plan is to explain it to you first. Oh, and you can just save a photo of the card in your phone; a digital copy is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nleaOF"&gt;But if you’re openly flaunting the law and refuse to take the test, the agency can fine you up to a maximum of $1,548 per violation, possibly including Part 107 violations that you wouldn’t normally worry about when flying for fun. That’s because you’re not actually covered under the recreational exception if you don’t complete the test, the FAA tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqXcSg"&gt;Just take the test. It’s so ridiculously easy to comply, you should just get it over with now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFh4bw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How easy are we talking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SP40BG"&gt;Here’s a sample question. You tell me: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Ch1tDk"&gt;True or false: checking your drone after each flight is a good idea because it is a time when damage can be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1XvXf-cCR2rz0kxL8h9cx6ZHzQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735175/checking_your_drone.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sample TRUST question.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5RZlDz"&gt;The entire test took me around eight minutes to complete, including the time it took to snap a few screenshots. There’s no need to study, either: the test itself shows you the material, then quizzes you immediately after to see if you were paying attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y2TYfx"&gt;Also... I’m not sure you can fail? Each quiz points out which answers you got wrong and why, and you can just take it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXbCKe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see. So... where can I take the TRUST test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzidHg"&gt;The FAA keeps an updated list of partner websites &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/recreational_fliers/knowledge_test_updates/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, and you can pick whichever you like best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozZOmt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the FAA keep a log of who’s taken the test?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sz0J6t"&gt;Not at all, they say. Your certificate doesn’t expire, either, because the FAA doesn’t keep track of anything beyond a unique number generated at the time you take the test. “Neither the test administrator, nor the FAA, will maintain personally identifiable information about the recreational flyer so it is not possible to re-print or re-issue your original certificate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHl4AM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If Congress mandated this test in 2018, have I been breaking the law by flying drones before now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1BAYD"&gt;You couldn’t take a test that didn’t exist. Until now, the FAA says, it was good enough to register your drone and follow either the FAA’s published safety guidelines or those of an established aeronautical organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPhaoR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need to register my drone? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSVAtu"&gt;Yes — unless it weighs less than 0.55 pounds (249g), like a lot of toy-grade drones and lightweight prosumer craft like the Hubsan Zino Mini Pro and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;DJI’s Mini 2&lt;/a&gt;, which we recently called our favorite drone under $500. If it weighs more, you need to register them and label them with your registration number. FAA pro tip: recreational fliers can re-use the same registration number for every drone they own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zThSUL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doesn’t the recreational exception under 49 US &lt;/strong&gt;§ &lt;strong&gt;44809&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;state you need to register your drone, period, regardless of how much it weighs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQFaLT"&gt;Well, aren’t you well-read! But no, the FAA isn’t suddenly forcing your Mavic Mini into a federal database — I asked, and the agency told me straight-up you still don’t need to register drones under 0.55 pounds. (Legal eagles can follow § 44809 to § 441 and then to &lt;a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/14/48.15"&gt;14 CFR 48.15 subpart (b)&lt;/a&gt;, which says that registration isn’t required if you’re flying a sub-0.55 lbs drone under § 44809 anyways.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcQ1mE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I flash my test completion certificate to anyone complaining about my drone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1Fw7I"&gt;I guess you could try? The FAA and law enforcement can ask you to show proof of completion, but it’s not a license. If authorities or even local custodians tell you to leave because your drone is bugging people, maybe don’t give the flying community a bad name by insisting you have rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDwESo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m vaguely near an airport. Can I still fly my drone? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgOwJD"&gt;It really depends on the airport, but if you’re not in the immediate flight path(s) or very close to the facilities, there’s a decent chance you can apply for an automatic airspace authorization just by tapping your info into a smartphone app &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/programs_partnerships/data_exchange/"&gt;that supports LAANC&lt;/a&gt;, like Aloft or AirMap. (You’ll find more at that LAANC link.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AGfIKi4ZtIpPrQIE6as3s4W5rNc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22735190/0_height.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feels bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jHUwUD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m not particularly close to an airport, but that LAANC app is telling me I can’t fly higher than 0 feet in my own backyard. WTF?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o4Ee6c"&gt;Ever heard the idea that the FAA has jurisdiction all the way down to the tip of a blade of grass? In your case, it might actually be true, and you won’t be able to legally fly even if you’ve got tall trees surrounding your house. It’s not that your drone would necessarily be dangerous below the treeline, but that there might not be enough of a safe buffer if your drone takes off in a direction you &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; intend for it to go, the FAA explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccs3ay"&gt;It’s about risk mitigation, giving everyone time to alter course to avoid a collision. Or at least that’s the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvImzS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B4UFLY says there’s a TFR. What’s that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJkKBN"&gt;That’s a Temporary Flight Restriction, and you’ll want to obey. You don’t want to be the one whose drone got shot down for threatening a government official or interfering with an emergency operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHfroK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are drone laws really this simple now: take a 10-minute test, check an app, stay under 400 feet, never look away, don’t do anything stupid? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="mbU6eD"&gt;For now, if you’re flying for fun. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;But just you wait until 2023&lt;/a&gt;, when many existing drones will need to be retrofitted to broadcast your location, your drone’s location, registration number, altitude, and speed — or else only fly in designated safe areas. &lt;a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/remote_id/"&gt;The Remote ID rule&lt;/a&gt; is currently scheduled to take full force in September 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple MagSafe Battery Pack review:  convenience over capacity</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Perfectly designed for the iPhone, but not a lot of charge&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mv1rms"&gt;Apple’s new MagSafe Battery Pack is a white rectangle you can stick to the back of an iPhone 12 to charge it. It’s Apple’s third run at designing an external battery solution for the iPhone and I like it better than the earlier battery cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exfu7u"&gt;However, anybody considering spending $99 on this battery ought to keep one important fact in mind: even Apple cannot break the laws of physics. It is just as bound by the same rules of magnetism and electrons as everybody else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOZZHa"&gt;Those laws require tradeoffs: A battery that could fully charge up most iPhone 12 models would be big. A battery small enough to not look odd on a phone wouldn’t have enough juice. Plus, electrons can only flow so fast without building up heat and degrading the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="35Ynq9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple can’t defeat the laws of physics&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QZnHT6"&gt;Apple found a balance between all those extremes and it maintains that balance with a tight software integration that aggressively manages how this battery charges your phone. The result is a gadget that’s singularly focused on the iPhone — sometimes to its own detriment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PPVBma"&gt;The best part about the MagSafe Battery is that it also serves as a fast-charging wireless MagSafe puck when it’s plugged in. So the big question is whether all that is enough to justify the price, especially compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IkVgoJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10664255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="CY6cYp"&gt;The MagSafe Battery doesn’t have enough energy to fully charge an iPhone 12 Mini from zero to 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aDUiI9"&gt;In my testing, the MagSafe Battery was fully drained when my iPhone 12 Mini reached 83 percent, which took 130 minutes of charging. I didn’t have it plugged in for this test, which meant it charged at a relatively pokey 5W speed, so as to minimize heat and maximize the battery’s longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJY99r"&gt;I used the iPhone very sporadically during the charging period (mostly to record the results every 15 minutes), though I did listen to a 15-minute podcast over Bluetooth which slowed the charging down a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSIBi"&gt;Bottom line: it’s a small battery and it will help you top up your iPhone, not fully charge it. On larger iPhone 12 models, it won’t even hit that 83 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="3oG47H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It performs better than its 1,460mAh rating would suggest&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hHfQPO9Akof4nKcvPy2tOkdDU2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733362/DSC02778_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen that appears when you attach the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sGKgdGSoVtUCmkvmzsTidUJvvb4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733367/DSC02789_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTf0Fe"&gt;There is a discussion to have about what the right way to talk about battery size is. The MagSafe Battery only has a 1,460mAh battery, but that number isn’t comparable to other batteries because it can push through more volts (7.62V). So the MagSafe Battery’s rated 11.13Wh (Watt-hours) is the number that actually matters. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08TW7BRTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker makes a 5,000mAh battery with wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; and magnets for under $50. It’s rated at 18.5Wh, so the differences are smaller than they first appear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5jxgt"&gt;The battery measurement discussion is interesting, but it doesn’t change the fact that the MagSafe Battery is simply small. It’s meant to be pocketable and easy to carry, and so you should think of it as something that can stretch your battery life just a little — not get you through multiple days away from a charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="10L4qZ"&gt;As you might expect, the software experience with the MagSafe Battery is tightly integrated into the iPhone. There are big animations that show the charge of both your phone and the battery when you attach it. It shows up on the battery level widget, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0D1sYM"&gt;More interestingly, when you first attach the battery, your iPhone will pop up a notice that this battery won’t charge your phone above 90 percent — by design. Those last few percentage points put a lot of stress on batteries, and in this context it’s just not worth it. I think it’s a smart move, but if you absolutely want that last 10 percent, you can long press the battery icon in the Control Center and tell it to charge past 90 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpqMfamewmQtoxQWS4fzM2o6JSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733391/DSC02736_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Anker battery next to the MagSafe Battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g2C2x6Q9ZfJwS723cnSduTH_uyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733395/DSC02737_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Anker battery is a bit larger, but it also has a larger battery inside.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YkVmQo"&gt;I know this sounds both complicated and disappointing, but in use it’s actually the opposite. I would just slap the battery on the back of my phone when I was worried about battery life and didn’t sweat the details. The result was not needing to keep an eye on battery life as much as I usually do. It’s elegant instead of powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I63fDm"&gt;That’s all smart, but it only happens with the iPhone. It is certainly a nicer overall experience than you’d get with the Anker battery, which is thicker to boot. But the Anker has other advantages. Its battery is bigger, for one thing. It also has a USB-C port on it that both takes charge when plugged in &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; can be used to charge devices via a wire. It’s less elegant for iPhone users, but it’s much more versatile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brd6xx"&gt;The Lightning port on the bottom of the MagSafe Battery means iPhone users can keep using the same charging cable, so it’s probably the right call to keep it. It’s just too bad that Lightning can’t charge in either direction like a USB-C port can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtsqaOrbK1sEKzSO_o-PStYZwqE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733335/DSC02729_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MagSafe Battery Pack nearly perfectly fits the iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="klt8W8"&gt;The MagSafe Battery is designed to match the dimensions of the iPhone 12 Mini perfectly. It aligns exactly to the edges and is more comfortable to hold than I expected. If you have a larger iPhone, it will sit on the back a bit more awkwardly — it looks positively tiny on the iPhone 12 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="OC1jUe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every battery pack looks silly attached to a phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qN3kfAlg7EpFcCtrEkA3jsg5da4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733380/DSC02786_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack looks a little funny on an iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yuxtv"&gt;I &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1417548597785202689"&gt;polled Twitter for questions&lt;/a&gt; about the battery and I was taken aback by the vitriol I saw in my replies — and elsewhere. It’s easy to make fun of how a battery pack looks on the back of a phone. It’s also easy to go after it for not providing enough charge. Having used it, I’m not sure I’d want it any larger and I certainly wouldn’t want it any smaller. To me, there’s no such thing as a good-looking external battery. At the end of the day, they’re all squarish or oblong hunks of plastic or metal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodY2M"&gt;The white plastic has a matte finish that helps a little with grip, but I wouldn’t call it soft touch. I do wonder if it’ll pick up stains from blue jeans over time, but in the few days I’ve been testing it, it’s remained clean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJkFgB"&gt;It snaps on the back of a caseless iPhone with a satisfying snick. It’s as secure as I think can be fairly expected from something connected with magnets. It’d be nice if the alignment magnet was a little stronger, but I am glad that my iPhone doesn’t contain magnets so strong that it messes with credit cards. Physics!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gnySp"&gt;You can intentionally shake off the battery or have it slip off when putting it in your pocket, but I didn’t have those problems. However, if you are planning on using it with a case, you absolutely need a MagSafe compatible case that itself has magnets on it. I use a very thin plastic case and that minimal layer was more than enough to stop the magnets from working effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2O_OrQpi14EUvmfjoI85z4PHeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733340/DSC02781_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack shows how much charge it has left in an iPhone widget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q6FsGU"&gt;After two days testing a couple different MagSafe Batteries on both an iPhone 12 Mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, I came to a surprising conclusion. My favorite part isn’t the battery, it’s the MagSafe charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4oeA8"&gt;When I think of the MagSafe Battery as a MagSafe charging puck that just happens to have a battery attached to it, I think it makes a little more sense as a product. Apple’s MagSafe puck costs $40 — that certainly doesn’t make the $99 asking price for this battery a deal, but it might be worth buying the battery instead of the puck for some people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEKKns"&gt;I do have to point out that for $99 I would have expected Apple to at least include a Lightning cable. It doesn’t, nor does it include a charging brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyPkVs"&gt;When plugged into a powerful enough wall charger, the MagSafe Battery can charge the phone at up to 15W, just like the standard MagSafe disc. The charger can fill up both itself and your iPhone. If you want to prioritize charging speed on the iPhone, you can plug &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; in instead and then the iPhone will use reverse wireless charging to top up the battery. (Unfortunately and unlike Android phones, the iPhone’s reverse wireless charging doesn’t work for other devices, like AirPods.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-CjsYo_ztMxG5Gs0F81pBS-1Azg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22733349/DSC02759_dbohn_verge.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe Battery Pack can also wirelessly charge AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="p4evuG"&gt;The MagSafe Battery’s best feature is that it is a good MagSafe wireless charger. It’s also a decent battery — but only if you think of it as a small extender, one that trades longevity for size. Do I wish it had more capacity? Of course. I also wish it could have more capacity without getting any larger than it already is. I don’t begrudge physics and I get why Apple chose the size it did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sk8y9b"&gt;But paying $99 for all the MagSafe Battery’s elegance and integration doesn’t make sense when there are much cheaper options that are less beholden to working with just one phone. A battery pack is going to look silly no matter what, you might as well get one that’s as versatile as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
