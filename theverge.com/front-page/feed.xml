    <title>Moto G Stylus 2021 leak suggests a larger screen and higher price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Moto G Stylus 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfwQ4m86UhQqckE51vhPki_TCsw=/250x0:1750x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486040/Moto_G_Stylus_2021_leaked.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upcoming Moto G Stylus 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Image via Phone Arena&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OtVRDQ"&gt;Detailed specs and images of the 2021 Moto G Stylus have leaked by way of an early Amazon listing, as &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/motorola-moto-g-stylus-2021-renders-leak_id128790"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Phone Arena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This iteration on the stylus-having, budget-friendly device looks to borrow features from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432283/motorola-moto-g9-plus-phone-available-now-brazil"&gt;this year’s Moto G9 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, including a 6.8-inch FHD+ display that’s slightly larger than its predecessor’s 6.4-inch screen. Amazon’s (now removed) page lists a price of $341, which is unlikely to be the final MSRP, but it’s a bit higher than the original G Stylus’ $299 introductory price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WuRkwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new Moto G Stylus and G Power are surprisingly adept cameraphones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OFwmp1"&gt;One of the things we liked best about the prior G Stylus was the image quality from its camera, and Motorola appears to have tweaked the hardware setup in the 2021 version. Aside from a 48-megapixel main rear camera, it adopts the quad-camera array from the Moto G9 Plus, including an 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro camera, and 2-megapixel depth-sensing camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyBiQr"&gt;The leaked listing shows a few other details, including Android 10 pre-loaded, a 4,000mAh battery, and two color options: “aurora white” and “aurora black.” It will be one of few options for those looking for a stylus bundled with their phone; Samsung’s Galaxy Note series is another one, but those devices are much more expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;may be going away soon&lt;/a&gt;. While Motorola hasn’t given an official launch date for the new G Stylus, it’s safe to assume that the device will be formally revealed soon if retailers are readying listings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FTC is suing Facebook to unwind its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-t4qaOAuuR7PwP50kffonVhFPqE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68486026/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5VbIT"&gt;On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced a massive antitrust lawsuit against Facebook, claiming the social media giant has harmed competition by buying up smaller companies like Instagram and WhatsApp to squash the threat they posed to its business. Forty-seven other state and regional attorneys general are joining the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s9HRV"&gt;The lawsuit centers on Facebook’s history of acquisitions starting, particularly its $1 billion purchase of Instagram in 2011. In addition to its acquisition strategy, the attorneys general allege that Facebook used the power and reach of its platform to stifle user growth for competing services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dl6FFO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SIUU"&gt;“For nearly a decade, Facebook has used its dominance and monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition,” James said in a press conference today. “Facebook used vast amounts of money to acquire potential rivals before they could threaten the company’s dominance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXfkHK"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission is expected to &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/08/state-federal-suits-against-facebook-expected-as-tech-antitrust-fight-escalates-443859"&gt;bring a lawsuit against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; on similar grounds later today. The FTC case goes even further than the state case, explicitly calling on the court to unwind the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, spinning off both into independent companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwbeAJ"&gt;The two lawsuits are the result of independent investigations, but the efforts are expected to coordinate. “We look forward to collaborating with them in the litigation process,” said James in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="goz4nU"&gt;In emails &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21345723/facebook-instagram-documents-emails-mark-zuckerberg-kevin-systrom-hearing"&gt;revealed by the House of Representatives’ antitrust subcommittee hearing this summer&lt;/a&gt;, Zuckerberg characterized his intent to buy Instagram in emails to his David Ebersman, who was then Facebook’s chief financial officer, as a way to neutralize a competitor while at the same time improving Facebook — by incorporating the features its competitor invented before any other upstart has enough time to catch up and pose a similar threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqfRuL"&gt;“One way of looking at this is that what we’re really buying is time. Even if some new competitors springs up, buying Instagram, Path, Foursquare, etc now will give us a year or more to integrate their dynamics before anyone can get close to their scale again. Within that time, if we incorporate the social mechanics they were using, those new products won’t get much traction since we’ll already have their mechanics deployed at scale,” Zuckerberg explained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQP0bk"&gt;Within the hour, Zuckerberg sent a follow-up reply, writing, “I didn’t mean to imply that we’d be buying them to prevent them from competing with us in any way,” he wrote. Antitrust lawyers saw that as an admission of guilt from Zuckerberg, who appeared to realize that what he wrote in those emails regarding his acquisition strategy constituted anticompetitive behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gj0GBT"&gt;Another pillar of the states’ antitrust lawsuit is whether Facebook acquiring a company made the product worse off from a consumer benefit standpoint — in particular, with regard to privacy. Facebook has long claimed that its resources and scale are responsible for turning apps like Instagram and WhatsApp into gigantic platforms with billions of users. But investigators targeting the deals for anticompetitive behavior are examining how, for instance, Facebook’s purchase of WhatsApp and its decision to later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/25/12638698/whatsapp-to-start-sharing-user-data-with-facebook"&gt;utilize WhatsApp user data&lt;/a&gt; may have harmed consumers and stifled competition from rivals with better privacy practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AHUU4"&gt;Notably, the creators of both Instagram and WhatsApp have left Facebook — some, like WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20955638/whatsapp-brian-acton-facebook-delete-mark-zuckerberg-signal-encryption"&gt;vocally disagreeing with the direction Facebook took his product&lt;/a&gt; and what the company has done to privacy in general. WhatsApp’s other co-founder, Jan Koum, left shortly after Acton, having &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17304792/whatsapp-jan-koum-facebook-data-privacy-encryption"&gt;reportedly clashed with Facebook leadership&lt;/a&gt; over its data-sharing initiative. Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger left the company over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking"&gt;years of built-up tensions&lt;/a&gt; between the photo-sharing app and its relationship to Facebook’s business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HnaiT"&gt;The actions are already drawing applause from antitrust advocates in Congress. Representative David Cicilline (D-RI), who led the House Antitrust hearing in July, cheered on the lawsuits in a statement to the press. “Facebook is a monopoly,” said Rep. Cicilline. “Facebook has broken the law. It must be broken up. I applaud the FTC and state attorneys general who are leading this effort today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QG221T"&gt;The lawsuit marks the second major regulatory effort from the US government to rein in Big Tech, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21454192/google-monopoly-antitrust-case-lawsuit-filed-us-doj-department-of-justice"&gt;Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Google in October&lt;/a&gt; for alleged illegal monopolization of the search and online ad markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2gv1d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cruise is now testing fully driverless cars in San Francisco</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Self-propelled car GM Cruise" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fSWtiMLpdAxH7cFets7rVOKqucQ=/4x0:4924x3280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485294/1150127517.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrej Sokolow / picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fpv4cx"&gt;Cruise, the self-driving car company affiliated with General Motors and Honda, is testing fully driverless cars, without a human safety driver behind the steering wheel, in San Francisco. The company is among the first to test its driverless vehicles in a dense, complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro4Wgn"&gt;“Getting to driverless in SF took more than five years of rigorous testing, over 2 million miles of driving in one of the craziest driving environments, together with hard work from a huge team of dedicated engineers and others across Cruise, as well as at GM,” Cruise CEO Dan Ammann said in a call with reporters. “And not to mention several billion dollars of investment along the way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvXu7p0OD6NO-Ul6mgDPQjs1wzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22157426/Cruise_Going_Driverless_By_The_Numbers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9OLEBR"&gt;To be sure, the vehicles are not completely alone in the wilderness. In a video released by the company, a Cruise employee is seen in the passenger seat while the car drives itself through the darkened streets of San Francisco. Cruise’s vehicles all have an emergency switch in the center channel near the gear shift in case something goes wrong, and they are also monitored remotely by Cruise employees. Asked whether remote operators are able to take control of the vehicle when needed, Ammann declined to answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wn1Jsl"&gt;“The safety operator has the ability to bring the vehicle to a stop in the event of an emergency, but does not have access to standard driver controls,” a spokesperson said. “Eventually, this safety operator will be fully removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DC8i3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517833/cruise-driverless-cars-test-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Cruise was approved to test fully driverless cars&lt;/a&gt; (also called Level 4 in industry parlance) in California on October 15th. According to the DMV, Cruise can only test five driverless vehicles “on specified streets within San Francisco.” The vehicles are not allowed to exceed 30 mph, and can’t operate during heavy fog or heavy rain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wykK7e"&gt;Cruise was the fifth company to receive a driverless permit from the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles, the others being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/30/18044670/waymo-fully-driverless-car-permit-california-dmv"&gt;Waymo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21212719/nuro-driverless-car-test-california-dmv-delivery"&gt;Nuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/18/zoox-becomes-fourth-company-to-land-driverless-testing-permit-in-california/"&gt;Zoox&lt;/a&gt;, and AutoX. Currently, 60 companies have an active permit to test autonomous vehicles with a safety driver in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SaH27r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the first time that Cruise has demonstrated its Level 4 capabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CnLyqr"&gt;This is the first time that Cruise has demonstrated its Level 4 capabilities. Its main rival, Google spinoff Waymo, has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;testing its fully driverless vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in Phoenix for over a year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507814/waymo-driverless-cars-allow-more-customers-phoenix"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be making its Level 4 taxi service available to more customers. Cruise doesn’t allow non-employees to ride in its vehicles. The company had planned to launch a commercial taxi service in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707242/cruise-gm-self-driving-taxi-launch-delay-2019"&gt;but failed to do so&lt;/a&gt;, and it has yet to publicly commit to a new date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QH4k5e"&gt;Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075977/cruise-driverless-car-gm-no-steering-wheel-pedals-ev-exclusive-first-look"&gt;Cruise unveiled the Cruise Origin&lt;/a&gt;, a fully driverless prototype vehicle without a steering wheel, pedals, or any controls typically associated with human driving. The vehicle, which will go into production at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;GM’s Detroit-Hamtramck plant&lt;/a&gt;, is built to be shared by multiple passengers — though it remains to be seen how much appetite there is for shared vehicles in a post-COVID world. Cruise recently unveiled a new set of safety protocols intended to keep people socially distant during trips and the vehicle sanitized between fares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ug9q3"&gt;The news that the company will be relying less on its operations staff during its testing comes after Cruise’s safety drivers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21473719/waymo-cruise-self-driving-car-backup-safety-driver-pandemic-wildfires-california"&gt;complained about a lack of safety standards&lt;/a&gt; during the pandemic and subsequent wildfires. They accuse Cruise of deploying its self-driving cars during the spring lockdown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286301/cruise-self-driving-car-testing-san-francisco-stay-home-order"&gt;in defiance of public health orders&lt;/a&gt; banning nonessential travel. And they say Cruise isn’t doing enough to keep them safe during these public health crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDpm7A"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Exclusive look at Cruise’s first fully driverless car|74695" data-volume-uuid="ce8840a6b" data-volume-id="74695" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-527" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s redesigned Fire TV software starts rolling out today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bw409VoTcNy4HtaJSpW11IVPgXU=/119x0:1417x865/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485133/NewFireTV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hfn4yn"&gt;The software that runs on Amazon’s Fire TV streaming devices is set to undergo a significant overhaul in the coming weeks, and the rollout of the “new Fire TV experience” begins today on some devices. After the update is installed, you’ll have access to new features like multiuser support (with personalized recommendations and watch lists for each profile) and a streamlined interface that makes it faster to reach your favorite entertainment apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk6xjY"&gt;When you’re in the mood to watch something but you’re not sure what, there’s also a new “Find” tab that brings together movies, TV shows, free ad-supported content, and sports from various services. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EUxilEet9CGXCABt7jt4cWSvgPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22157413/Screen_Shot_2020_12_09_at_12.16.51_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now have individual user profiles on the Fire TV — including kids accounts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AToeyj"&gt;Amazon has also improved Alexa integration with the new Fire TV dashboard. If you set up a voice profile, Alexa will be able to recognize your voice and automatically switch to the right profile when you ask it to, and you can switch between various sections (live TV, news, etc.) with voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DK0ue9"&gt;The new experience also adds support for picture-in-picture and less intrusive on-screen Alexa responses when you ask for things like the weather; it’ll now appear at the bottom of the screen instead of covering the content you’re watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li9B4W"&gt;Oddly, Amazon is rolling out this new software first to its recently introduced Fire TV Stick and Fire TV Stick Lite; higher-end devices like the Fire TV Stick 4K and Fire TV Cube will have to wait until early 2021. Only a small subset of eligible devices will get it right away; Amazon doesn’t revamp the Fire TV interface often, so the company is taking its time to make sure everything goes smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spider-Man: Miles Morales runs at 60fps with ray tracing in new mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dRF-rG-B6ZEyN7wTLJPstkEwO4k=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68485095/MilesMorales_PS5_Standoff_Legal_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qnd8gn"&gt;At launch, &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt; on PlayStation 5 was able to run at 60fps in Performance mode or at 30fps but with ray tracing in Fidelity mode, meaning that you’d have to pick between buttery-smooth frame rates or higher graphical fidelity while playing through the game. Thanks to a new mode added in an update, though, you can now run the game at 60fps &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRaY0E"&gt;The new mode is called “Performance RT,” and you can turn it on in settings. “This is an alternate version of the 60 frames per second ‘Performance’ mode, adding ray-tracing by adjusting the scene resolution, reflection quality, and pedestrian density,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ax_zer0/status/1336643995515170816"&gt;according to the description of the new mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="coKzTW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our new update overnight introduced Performance RT mode on PS5. 60fps and ray-tracing! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SSRy9vq9Aw"&gt;https://t.co/SSRy9vq9Aw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/1336698057900007424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 9, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NGtnFC"&gt;It’s not clear exactly how the resolution of the game is changed in the Performance RT mode. And we don’t know if the new mode will also be coming to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Remastered&lt;/em&gt;, the updated version of the 2018 hit that’s available as part of the $70 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;. Sony and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; developer Insomniac Games didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4auH0"&gt;The new Performance RT mode seems like it could be the ideal way to experience &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;. I haven’t played the game yet, but when I do, I know I’ll be turning on the Performance RT mode to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch overhauls its rules around harassment and hateful conduct </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dQAVKL46mPU44aGZ1IjtWRdSa8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484822/acastro_190926_1777_twitch_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DYEAaG"&gt;Today, Twitch is announcing changes to its policies around harassment and hateful conduct. The reason, the company says, is because marginalized people — “women, members of the LGBTQIA+ community, Black, Indigenous, and people of color,” the company wrote in a blog post — are disproportionately harassed on the site. The new policy is far more specific about what constitutes harassment and abuse. The larger changes include stricter protections around sexual harassment, the policy extending off platform to an extent, and that enforcement in cases that are harder to judge will rely on external signals that the behavior was unwanted (like channel timeouts). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMgUAv"&gt;A bigger overhaul has come to Twitch’s policy regarding sexual harassment; it’s now much more stringent in what is and isn’t permitted, and it now has its own category in the terms of service. The policy now prohibits “[r]epeatedly commenting on someone’s perceived attractiveness, even in what you believe to be a positive or complimentary manner,” if there’s an indication the behavior is unwelcome (if you’ve been asked to stop, been banned from the channel, or timed out); it also forbids “[m]aking lewd or explicit comments about anyone’s sexuality or physical appearance,” specifically stating that the company will not make an exception for public figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MvLVpG"&gt;Twitch says that new rules will apply to content created on January 22nd — the day it goes into effect — and afterward. The company also says that while the policy is more stringent in some ways, it will also dole out punishments according to severity. Enforcement will also depend on signals from targeted individuals in cases where potentially offending behavior is more subjective. “In the event of a more subjective situation, for example competitive banter or trash talk, will rely on signals from the person being targeted, or their mods, so that we can take appropriate action and avoid punishing users in situations where that behavior is welcome,” the company wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0ovxCm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stream sniping gets its own line&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbLjX6"&gt;Mostly, it seems that the new policy is aimed at plugging the holes in the old one. For example, the Confederate flag is now banned in chat, and promoting “hateful viewpoints under the guise of education or comedy” will lead to a suspension. Stream sniping gets its own line; it’s banned. And broadcasters who don’t make an effort to curtail “incitement or organization of abuse” in their own channels will be banned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2LtLA"&gt;Twitch says it has worked with its Safety Advisory Council and industry experts for months on the new rules, and the effort shows. Streamers and audiences should read the new guidelines &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/harassment/20210122/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, because they’re worth reading in full. Twitch is also hosting three events over the next month to familiarize broadcasters and their communities with the new rules: a “Creator Camp” discussion of the policy on December 11th, a town hall on December 16th covering enforcement, and a final Creator Camp on January 6th to review the policy again and answer frequently asked questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W9mat"&gt;All told, it looks like Twitch has decided to take serious action against its most toxic users. But as with any policy, its effectiveness depends on the company’s willingness to enforce its own rules. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches health research app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Google New York Chelsea Office (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lqYtOgIQB8yUItQCuEiNNutl8RI=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484694/google-logo-stock-31_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4ivc0"&gt;Google announced Wednesday that it is launching a new research app for Android phones, which would allow anyone with a device to participate in medical studies. The first study run through the app, called Google Health Studies, will look at respiratory illnesses like the flu and COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJVlhD"&gt;Participants in the study will use the app to report any respiratory symptoms, the precautions they’re taking to prevent disease, and whether they’ve been tested for COVID-19 or the flu. The app will collect &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;demographic data&lt;/a&gt;, like age, gender, and race as well. “Researchers in this study can examine trends to understand the link between mobility (such as the number of daily trips a person makes outside the home) and the spread of COVID-19,” Google wrote in a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/google-health-studies-app/"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvC55E"&gt;The app will send data to researchers using a technique called federated learning, which will batch aggregated trends from multiple devices, rather than pull information from each participant individually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5nQAn"&gt;Health Studies is Google’s answer to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fios%2Fresearch-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Research app&lt;/a&gt;, which runs on iOS devices. Last year, it launched &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2019%2F11%2Fapple-launches-three-innovative-studies-today-in-the-new-research-app%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F9%2F22165465%2Fgoogle-health-research-app-covid-flu-apple#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; on menstrual cycles, mobility and heart health, and hearing. Apple also lets researchers build their own iPhone apps through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/10/8177683/apple-research-kit-app-ethics-medical-research"&gt;ResearchKit program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dBE5B"&gt;Studies run through the app will come with the same caveats as research from other commercial wearable products: they can only enroll people who can purchase products like an Android phone. Aggregated data is a good way to protect privacy, but it means researchers aren’t able to take a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681254/data-health-apps-clue-period-tracking-sleep-fitness-research"&gt;granular look&lt;/a&gt; at information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afz4N1"&gt;Android phone users have a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/the-median-income-for-iphone-users-is-40-higher-than-that-of-android-users-2014-9"&gt;lower median income&lt;/a&gt; than iPhone users, which might be a benefit for Google Health Studies. “Android represents probably a more diverse dataset [than iPhone]. We’re pretty excited about the ability to leverage that,” John Brownstein, a chief innovation officer of Boston Children’s Hospital working on the study with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/09/google-health-studies-apple/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Hb9XK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirPods Pro are back down to $190 at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zKVJn3AO7rbqjw6BL8xep6rSVuY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484304/cwelch_191031_3763_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6ufcgT"&gt;If you’re struggling to think of a gift for someone in your life, it’s hard to fail with a good set of headphones. Thankfully, many of the best models currently available have seen sharp discounts in the lead-up to the holidays. Today’s standout deals are on the Apple AirPods Pro at Woot for $190 (around $220 everywhere else). Now that the $550 AirPods Max are a thing, the Pro is no longer the most expensive model. Also worth sharing today is a deal on Microsoft’s Surface Headphones, a noise-canceling over-ear model for $150 instead of its usual $200 asking price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTeiCU"&gt;We’ve also found some noteworthy deals on PS4 games that might be on a wish list you’re in charge of tackling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Gfb7aP"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FXUzP"&gt;Headphones and earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SKbG0n"&gt;Woot is offering the AirPods Pro for $190. They cost $250 from Apple directly, though most retailers are selling them for around $220. Woot says your order will arrive by Christmas. This model features noise cancellation as well as better sound and a more snug fit than standard AirPods because of their silicon tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="la9tiB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4hiXq"&gt;Microsoft’s over-ear noise-canceling wireless Surface Headphones are just $150 at Woot. These haven’t sold for lower than $190 at Amazon, so this is a fantastic deal on a new set. Compared to competing headphones from Sony and Bose, these stand out with their ingenious rotating dials for adjusting the volume and the level of noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jDKSff"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10217227"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="z8GQs2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="StZwzT"&gt;Fitbit’s fittest smartwatch is $70 off for the first time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HiuI6N"&gt;The Fitbit Sense, the company’s smartwatch that can take EKGs and determine stress levels by taking your skin’s temperature, is $260 at Best Buy and Amazon. It usually costs $330, and this is the biggest discount yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeBNRu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mel1NG"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Gg7rAb"&gt;Some PS5-ready games are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3NtOqL"&gt;At several retailers like &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dholidaysaleps4xb%26srule%3Dtop-sellers%26rt%3DplpRedesign%26sv%3Dnew%26pmax%3D10.00%26prefn1%3DavailabilityFilter%26prefv1%3DshipsIn24Hours" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726068073818073061" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon, and Target, you can find discounts on first-party PS4 games, most of which play great on the PS5. These aren’t best-ever deals, but they’re certainly more affordable than their usual asking prices. Here are a couple of newer releases:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fThHY5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591200" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0gaBxt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="j6EyIh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>YouTube will now remove videos disputing Joe Biden’s election victory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBqRpVFSbVsivwDoC3T3xa9MyOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484171/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PsmU55"&gt;On Wednesday, YouTube announced that it will begin removing any content alleging widespread voter fraud influenced the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvfnVL"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the November 3rd election, YouTube came under fire for allowing channels to publish videos making false claims about election results. In one instance, One America News Network, a verified YouTube channel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562910/youtube-2020-election-trump-misinformation-fake-news-recommendations"&gt;published a video&lt;/a&gt; declaring that “Trump won” the election. At the time, YouTube defended its decision to let the video stand, saying in a statement, “Like other companies, we’re allowing these videos because discussion of election results &amp;amp; the process of counting votes is allowed on YouTube.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5dbuP"&gt;The company went on to say that content from “authoritative news organizations” were “the most popular videos about the election.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXqZYU"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;Wednesday blog&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube said that its decision to begin removing misleading election videos follows the US’s safe harbor deadline and that “enough states have certified their election results to determine a President-elect.” Starting Wednesday, YouTube will begin removing any new content that misleads viewers about the outcome of the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLTLMS"&gt;YouTube’s announcement follows a series of lawsuits placed by the Donald Trump campaign challenging the results of the election. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court rejected a request to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/us/supreme-court-republican-challenge-pennsylvania-vote.html"&gt;block certification&lt;/a&gt; of Pennsylvania’s election results, making it nearly impossible for Republicans to invalidate Joe Biden’s victory in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4kkjm"&gt;In the post, YouTube said its election information panels had surfaced over 200,000 election-related videos and were shown over 4.5 billion times. The company said that it would &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/supporting-the-2020-us-election/"&gt;update these panels&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday, linking to electoral college results provided by the Office of the Federal Register calling Biden the official president-elect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFyrSR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft confirms the xCloud beta is coming to iOS and PC in spring 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dh7XplQQMoR5eJ-7VJQCDpAp5cI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484147/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2JxmC9"&gt;Microsoft has confirmed its timeline for bringing its xCloud cloud gaming service to Apple’s iOS platform and to Windows PCs, with the company saying it will support iPhone, iPad, and PC starting in spring 2021. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508706/microsoft-xcloud-ios-web-browser-2021"&gt;reported in October&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft was looking to bring xCloud to iOS via a mobile web app some time in “early 2021,” but Microsoft has clarified the timing in a &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/12/09/xbox-expands-cloud-gaming-to-more-devices-2021/"&gt;blog post published on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The PC version of xCloud will be delivered through the Xbox app for Windows 10, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3puCg"&gt;“In Spring 2021, we will take the next step in our journey to reach more players around the world by making cloud gaming as part of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate available on Windows PCs through the Xbox app and browser, and iOS devices through mobile web browser,” writes Jerret West, Microsoft’s Xbox marketing chief, in the blog post. “By adding over a billion devices as a path to playing in the Xbox ecosystem, we envision a seamless experience for all types of players.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oaqono"&gt;&lt;q&gt;xCloud is coming to iOS via the web and PC via the Xbox app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V8aq3M"&gt;xCloud will still be bundled as part of Microsoft’s $15 a month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Microsoft says it plans to launch its cloud gaming beta through Game Pass to more markets next year, including Australia, Brazil, Japan, and Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47Np1o"&gt;Due to limitations Apple has imposed on iOS apps and cloud services, Microsoft wasn’t able to support the iPhone and iPad when it launched xCloud in beta for Android in September. The two companies got into a public spat over whether xCloud in its current form could ever exist on the iPhone, after Apple said such a service would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;need to submit individual games for review&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoV739"&gt;Although Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21432695/apple-new-app-store-guidelines-streaming-game-services-email-purchases"&gt;offered Microsoft a compromise of sorts&lt;/a&gt; by allowing cloud gaming apps to run their cloud clients on iOS so long as they still submitted individual titles for review, the Xbox maker said such a solution would be a “bad experience for consumers” and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/11/21433071/microsoft-apple-app-store-rules-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-game-pass"&gt;decided to focus on a mobile web offering instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBGvts"&gt;Other cloud gaming providers have decided to do the same, and both Google and Nvidia announced mobile web versions of their respective services last moth. Nvidia’s is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;available now&lt;/a&gt;, with its GeForce Now cloud service running on iOS in beta. Google plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;launch an iOS version of its Stadia service&lt;/a&gt; via the mobile web before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
