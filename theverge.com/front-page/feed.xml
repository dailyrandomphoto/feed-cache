    <title>Sweet Tooth’s post-apocalyptic world is meant to be a ‘storybook dystopia’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tq3UIB"&gt;Jeff Lemire’s &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a comic book about a young boy surviving in a world ravaged by a pandemic. He also happens to be a “hybrid,” a new breed of half-human, half-animal creature that began to appear alongside the deadly sickness. It’s a dark story, one that had the potential to be incredibly bleak and uncomfortable when translated to television. That’s particularly true now, as the real world continues to deal with its own pandemic. For the team adapting the story for an upcoming series on Netflix, all of these factors combined to create a slightly different approach. “It made us lean more into the hope,” executive producer Amanda Burrell says of the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="95Mwbd"&gt;Netflix’s eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; series will debut on June 4th. It’s a live-action take on the comics, one that maintains the same basic premise: Gus, a nine-year-old boy with deer antlers, lives in relative isolation with his father, before eventually setting out into the larger world alongside a wanderer named Jepperd. (There are other changes, but they venture into spoiler territory.) Aside from the move to live-action, one of the biggest shifts is pacing. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; is a real page-turner in comic book form, but the show moves much more leisurely, lingering on key moments. That’s by design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iMAOrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SiBv5B"&gt;“We wanted to draw things out a bit more,” explains Burrell. “We wanted to give more time to Gus and Jepperd together. We wanted to slow down and ensure we were really inside all of the characters.” This also gives the show time to steadily introduce some of the more fantastical concepts, like the hybrids themselves, as early on, the focus is almost entirely on Gus. “We really wanted to slowly get the audience on board with this very specific type of new human, and really get them emotionally invested in Gus before opening it up too wide,” Burrell adds. “It was an intentional thing. We want the audience to be with these characters and not removed from them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LyXTVQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9zG9RuJb3QU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWqS7n"&gt;This focus on Gus is also where that hope comes from. The boy, played by Christian Convery, has a wide-eyed optimism that’s easy to get caught up in, particularly when it’s played against Jepperd’s cynicism. In fact, there’s almost a schism in the show, where the younger characters seem able to deal with the state of the world in a much more positive way compared to the adults. So even if there are incredibly dark moments, there’s a sense of balance. “We wanted to make sure that humanity wasn’t depicted in just such a dark, foreboding way,” Burrell says, adding, “We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world. That kind of hopeless feeling you get after you watch a show that has a bleakness to it. Then it was just about leaning into Gus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FHxNa5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We talked a lot about not wanting audiences to be alienated by the world.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q8jt2N"&gt;She describes the show’s vibe as a “storybook dystopia,” a feeling that was enhanced by filming in New Zealand. (The story is set in the US.) “We went to New Zealand, and it has this kind of heightened magic to it,” Burrell says. “The trees look slightly different, the mountains are bigger. It allowed us to really accentuate the beauty of nature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IuhnP"&gt;The pilot for &lt;em&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/em&gt; was filmed in 2019, before the current pandemic, and it wasn’t until it came time to write the rest of the season that “the world went nuts,” as Burrell describes it. The real-world pandemic had some influence over the show’s comparatively lighter tone, though it didn’t alter the actual story in any way. That said, Burrell notes that a tension could be felt during filming, particularly during one scene (which I won’t spoil) that feels eerily familiar after a 2020 filled with lockdowns and quarantines. “On set, you could hear a pin drop,” she explains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eoVzSe"&gt;This all raises an interesting question: why are people drawn to these stories, particularly as they more closely resemble our own reality (deer children aside)? The last year has seen major releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"&gt;the grim &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s take on the Stephen King classic &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2021/2/11/22277486/the-stand-new-ending-stephen-king"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the surprising heartwarming film &lt;em&gt;Love and Monsters&lt;/em&gt;, to name just a few. Burrell has a theory as to why this kind of post-apocalyptic setting continues to resonate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5xoAWJ"&gt;“There’s a tension to: what if it’s all over? I think the idea of the human spirit and the future, wrestling back constantly, is just so powerful,” she explains. “&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us &lt;/em&gt;is a great example. Seeing what humans are willing to do for one another; obviously it can get very dark, like in that instance. But it’s just really powerful to see what people do for one another. I think now more than ever we need to feel that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb’s CEO thinks the platform can replace your landlord</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cannes Lions 2016 : Day Three" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bfk2crChBha7uSq6mk6F3I1qD4=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344919/541787196.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJa8tz"&gt;Airbnb doesn’t want you to forget about Airbnb, especially when you’re planning post-pandemic vacations. So on Monday, the company &lt;a href="https://airbnb.pvxt.net/c/482924/264339/4273?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2F2021&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made multiple announcements&lt;/a&gt; all seemingly designed to get people renting, traveling, and, crucially, choosing Airbnb to do so. It announced flexible booking, which lets people search across days, weeks, or months to plan a trip, as well as more location flexibility when looking for a place to stay. It also launched a faster onboarding process for hosts, during a time when competitors &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vrbo-isnt-airbnbs-problem-11621510202"&gt;like Vrbo&lt;/a&gt; are trying to poach them, as well as a new service for Super Hosts that’ll allow them to reach out to the Airbnb team directly for support issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dGOYoA"&gt;“We just think there’s this huge inflection point in travel brought on by the pandemic,” Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky says in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And so we wanted to adapt our service to this changing world and kind of really ride this wave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgARri"&gt;At the same time, Airbnb is expanding its idea of travel beyond short vacations. Chesky says that nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are “long term,” or 28 days and longer. “Millions and millions of people” are staying and living at Airbnb listings on a monthly basis, he says, and in cities like New York, that figure is more like 60 percent. He views this as a a shift from travel to “living,” which has been propelled by people “discovering they do not need to be tethered to one location to live and work,” per the company’s &lt;a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/656283129/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Airbnb_Q1-2021-Shareholder-Letter_Final.pdf"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnj2Sx"&gt;“I think eventually in the future people will start paying for rent the way they pay for cable television, or for Netflix, you pay on a month-to-month basis,” he says. He didn’t mention how this could impact tenants, like those who prefer long-term rentals because it locks in their rent at a set price and offers legal protections. The idea is that more people are going to want flexibility and the ability to parachute into a destination and live like a local. Chesky says that Airbnb has dealt with evictions and squatters in the past and hasn’t found any “intractable issue” that can’t be handled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZRhxk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nearly a quarter of Airbnb bookings are for 28 days or longer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F6h8ii"&gt;That shift to long-term rentals doesn’t mean the business is changing how it vets guests, though. It won’t make renters prove income, submit a credit score, or leave a deposit of first and last month’s rent for longer stays, like traditional landlords require.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19ABsv"&gt;“I think that’s all anachronistic and going to eventually go away,” Chesky says, pointing to Airbnb’s prepay model as secure enough backing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw8aJQ"&gt;“So almost all this old system of renting, you don’t need to do anymore,” he says. “That is stuff that was invented before the technology allowed almost all this to be automated. It’s like using a rotary dial phone, suddenly we have smartphones.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SRbEH"&gt;He says Airbnb’s Trust and Safety team is “more sophisticated” than what landlords use and that eventually, people will prefer not to sign one-year leases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yijmxR"&gt;For price-conscious renters, he notes that the company is reexamining how fees on its platform work, particularly after &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airbnb-trending-twitter-customers-complain-host-cleaning-fees-rules-price-2021-5"&gt;a flurry of complaints&lt;/a&gt; about exorbitant cleaning fees. The team is refining their algorithm to determine the “best deal” for renters that takes fees into account, along with asking hosts and guests for their input on how to make fees work for everyone. Their solve will be coming out “later this year” he says, without offering details.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waze names former Hotwire president Neha Parikh as CEO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NpZQuic1EO3-b46f9lMWzf4rQE=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344870/akrales_160517_1059_A_0113.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vkqXaJ"&gt;Waze has a new CEO: Neha Parikh, the former president of Hotwire and a board member of Carvana. Parikh replaces Noam Bardin, who &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/10/waze-ceo-noam-bardin-to-leave-company-in-early-2021/"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; as CEO of the Google-owned navigation service last November after leading the company for 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6epDlZ"&gt;Parikh will join Waze as CEO starting in June, the company says. She is a veteran of online hospitality brand Expedia, having served in a variety of positions at two of the corporation’s subsidiaries: Hotels.com, where she ended as senior vice president for global brands and retails, and flight and hotel booking service Hotwire, where she is currently president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqTWlU"&gt;As Hotwire’s youngest and first female president, Parikh “led a return to growth by revamping the business model, reshaping the product, and rebuilding the team and culture,” Waze says. The aim is for her to do the same at Waze. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hu6K7GkuBYFnpXyvwVhuM785U1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539998/Neha_Parikh_2019.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Carvana&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Neha Parikh is the youngest and first female president of Hotwire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7KERje"&gt;“As Neha leads Waze into the future, she will remain hyper-focused on our passionate community, beloved brand, and best-in-class products,” a spokesperson for the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o1HF0Q"&gt;She was appointed to the board of Carvana in April 2019. The online car marketplace praised Parikh for her focus on customer service. “On my first visit to the Carvana offices, I took a picture of their prominently displayed values, one of which is ‘Your next customer may be your mom,’ which I love,” &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20190422005543/en/Carvana-Adds-Neha-Parikh-President-of-Hotwire-to-Board-of-Directors"&gt;she said in the press release&lt;/a&gt;. “Relentless customer focus has been central to my career, so I’m thrilled to align with a company that puts their customers first.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OmqQwY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Relentless customer focus has been central to my career”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="baXB1A"&gt;Waze was founded in Israel in 2008 by Ehud Shabtai, Amir Shinar, and Uri Levine. The crowdsourced navigation app quickly grew in popularity, praised for its ability to take into account traffic and construction in real time. The app quickly emerged as a top choice among Uber and Lyft drivers. And today, it has 140 million monthly active users who drive more than 24 billion miles (40 billion kilometers) every month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KYgAa"&gt;The company was acquired by Google in 2013 for a reported $1.1 billion. And the app continued to flourish, as Google refrained from absorbing it into its Maps division and allowed it to stay independent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ma18X"&gt;Like most companies, Waze hit a rough patch during the pandemic. Its number of monthly active users, or the number of customers using the app each month, and driven kilometers, the metric by which the company measures how far its customers drive while using Waze, both decreased significantly. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428907/waze-layoff-pandemic-google-navigation-driving"&gt;laid off 5 percent&lt;/a&gt; of its global workforce, or 30 people, in September. Its nascent Carpool service was hit especially hard, as people stopped commuting to work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMR7lE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Open-world RPG Pokémon Legends: Arceus is launching January 28th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g64PMho72s9zQBWQ1R2ecbLzm-g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344706/Switch_PokemonLegendsArceus_Screenshot__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wJVRpG"&gt;Possibly the most ambitious &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game to date will be available early next year. Today &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Pokemon/status/1397539085921800194"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; will be launching on the Nintendo Switch on January 28th, 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302841/pokemon-legends-arceus-open-world-rpg-nintendo-switch"&gt;The game was first announced in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECigw4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; looks to be a big change for &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt;, a franchise that’s become known for its slowly evolving roleplaying games. It’s an open-world RPG that takes place in a much older version of the Sinnoh region, before the time of pokémon trainers and organized competitions. In addition to the new setting, the experience also looks to be much more seamless compared to the main games, as Nintendo says players will be able to go out into the wild to “study the pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then throw poké balls.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS8HW9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legends&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only major &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; title in the works. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405886/new-pokemon-snap-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Nintendo recently released a modern version of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;are coming to the Switch on November 11th, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1397543238580547590"&gt;which the company also announced today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwbQvj1_XrGbBaO54-q2kLj4b3I=/40x0:1660x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344538/IG_Hiding_Likes__Consumer_View_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8k7TKT"&gt;You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook. After years of testing on both platforms, Facebook and Instagram have settled on an opt-in experience for hiding like counts to allow people to disable seeing them across all posts and an option to hide their own public like counts from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYfAa7"&gt;Instagram is enabling this feature after years of tests and pressure from experts to make changes to its platform. The service was ranked as “the most detrimental to young people’s mental health and wellbeing” in a &lt;a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/instagram-ranked-worst-for-young-people-s-mental-health.html"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by the Royal Society for Public Health UK. &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-removing-likes-from-instagram-could-affect-our-mental-health"&gt;Experts have argued&lt;/a&gt; that removing a like button or like counts could help reduce anxiety and social pressures for some Facebook and Instagram users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcSjNO"&gt;“We tested hiding like counts to see if it might depressurize people’s experience on Instagram,” says an Instagram spokesperson. “What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some, and annoying to others, particularly because people use like counts to get a sense for what’s trending or popular, so we’re giving you the choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gHOgYucb6dNkd5codKvIet0WQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540453/FB_Hiding_Likes_Mock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to hide Facebook like counts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ImiIQ0"&gt;You’ll now be able to toggle an option to hide all like counts on all posts in your feed on both Instagram and Facebook today. A separate option will let you hide your own like counts to others. You can also hide like counts on a per-post basis on Instagram, so there’s a little more flexibility to allow people to focus on the content of posts rather than the like counts.

    <title>Disney’s Cruella is absolutely absurd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil. She has black and white hair and is dressed in a structured leather ballgown. Her lips are painted with red glitter and “the future” is written over her eyes in black paint." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xo5n3ELAVqVxlyOxnU56XPtjLc8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344568/cru_24747_r2_79c1746d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walk walk fashion baby | Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It will delight you even as you question its need to exist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6hgAsF"&gt;I spent the entire run of Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; torn between delight and horror. Rarely has a film so neatly emotionally vivisected me as this one about a villain best known for &lt;em&gt;wanting to skin puppies to make a coat&lt;/em&gt;. Only &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; isn’t about that character really. It’s not about her war with the fur industry or PETA. It’s definitely not about a collection of Dalmatian dogs fleeing her furrier desires. It’s a colorful and pulpy tale of a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. I’m sorry if you ever thought, “I could never have anything but camp-fueled affection for Disney’s puppy killer” because this gal is a delight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7hOpW"&gt;This is more &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;in that it reimagines a notorious villain as a misunderstood hero besmirched by popular media. Yet I have no idea &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;it is a movie about Cruella de Vil and not simply an original film about a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. Where &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; (both the book and the musical) takes pains to explore how media can corrupt an image, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; largely sidesteps jibes about populism or media to just put on a big fabulous show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Stone dressed as Cruella de Vil. She is wearing a red ballgown with a black military style top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ay2iHTFzxqhjnJHRxBljIR8Pk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539291/cru_27097_r_c264a6a0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma Stone looks fabulous 90 percent of the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tFby7K"&gt;Plus, apart from the occasional cameo from Roger (played by a wonderfully schluppy-looking Kayvan Novak), Anita (a perky but sly Kirby Howell-Baptiste), and some black-and-white spotted pups, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with any of its source material. &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; at least took us to the natural end of the story after building up its hero. I’m not saying I needed to see Emma Stone skin 101 puppies, but at least then the focus on Cruella would have made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrkqgW"&gt;In every lull in the film I found myself trying to figure out why exactly &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; exists, entertaining as it is. One colleague jokingly told me he thinks it was made because Disney made some digital dog tech from &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to get the most out of it. To his credit, there are a lot of dogs running between Emma Stone's legs and leaping over her and generally being adorable in &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. There are even a few Dalmatians! They all look realistic and pettable until the uncanny valley occasionally catches them in its maw and you are reminded that those are some very fake dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBgrgY"&gt;And even if this film &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; greenlit as some bean counter’s way of making back the cash spent to produce the tech for &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp,&lt;/em&gt; it still means that somewhere once upon a time some Disney execs were sitting in their office, legs up on the desk, tasteful Mickey Mouse-branded socks peeking out from between expensively tailored pants and more expensive shoes, and looking at this pitch, saying “sure, let’s reimagine the story of that villain who really has no redeemable quality apart from her taste in cars as a misunderstood antisocial heroine just out to resolve some true injustices in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil in a red gown surrounded by party goers dressed entirely in black and white." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-eTx143tdh4Eppwr_6fWwzpWyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539293/24d414407a5cf2e6633fe7a10cc44182_4096x2730_b7af0050.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This woman was previously on fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iyLjtl"&gt;At no point does the film attempt to explain — or even hint — at how Cruella would turn from a fashion icon with a very deeply buried heart of gold into a monster forcing her friends to kidnap puppies from another friend and to make a coat. It starts with Cruella, then called Estella, going to school, causing trouble, and being doted on by her exceptionally nice mother. After a murder that Cruella blames herself for, she flees into the streets of London and meets two young thieves, Jasper and Horace. She dyes her distinguishable hair and joins them in their heist and the three become a family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6XOlx"&gt;But as much as Estella loves crime, her true passion is &lt;em&gt;fashion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaDvSf"&gt;We then shoot forward 10 years to an otherworldly version of ‘70s London. Estella’s adoptive brothers (Joel Fry gives Jasper heart even as Paul Walter Hauser happily plays Horace as a cartoon) get her a job at a high-end store in the hopes she’ll wow them with her skills as a designer and seamstress. And while she enrages her bosses, she catches the eye of the Baroness (Emma Thompson), the biggest and most powerful designer in London. Estella then is torn between a desire to prove herself to the Baroness and to destroy the Baroness, and the movie quickly becomes scene after scene of guerilla fashion shows framed like the most gorgeous-looking heists you’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Thompson as the Baroness. Her hair is up in an intricate hairstyle, she is wearing large sunglasses, gold earrings, a pearl necklace and a large gold coat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDOZX-STGhPUL-RMfBF3cM0U3o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539294/d3825ac27da7201ee96eaeab7066aa0e_4096x2730_745628ce.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Emma Thompson will be compared to Meryl Streep in &lt;/em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;em&gt;. The comparison will be well earned.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2HGWfo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; borders on camp with the way it hops between absurdity and melodrama — often in the same scene. I questioned if I was stoned as Cruella raced across London in a dump truck after charging a one-eyed Chihuahua with a jailbreak. Not because it was silly (it was!) but because it was played deadly seriously. Stone and Thompson anchor the whole affair with cartoonish characters treated with the gravitas of historical figures. They do not wink at the camera. They do not make sly referential jokes about the story material. They just go to war with flaming dresses and shimmering moth cocoons and the occasional blow of a dog whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="J7eQ60"&gt;You usually know when you’re supposed to laugh and when you’re just supposed to enjoy yourself watching a movie, but I found myself torn constantly by &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. It's like a fairy tale, and it's like a really good graphic novel, and it's unlike any of the films it will get compared to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LD2MF8"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cruella &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1073148/9358?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fmovies%2Fcruella%2F2GJTZuO8I01c" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; Friday, May 28th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys MGM for $8.45 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRNGpUaT8r90oQ1ZabsmhoMuYFg=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344420/mgm-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Metro Goldwyn Mayer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Keh1ON"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-mgm-have-signed-agreement-amazon-acquire-mgm"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the film and TV company MGM for $8.45 billion, the companies announced today. It’s a significant acquisition for the e-commerce giant, and it means it will own a library of content that’s reported to consist of around &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"&gt;4,000 films and 17,000 hours of TV&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition is likely to help Amazon attract even more big-spending Prime subscribers as its Prime Video service competes with the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meMfR2"&gt;MGM is perhaps most notable for being the Hollywood studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, but its library runs the gamut from classic films like &lt;em&gt;12 Angry Men&lt;/em&gt; to modern TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Vikings&lt;/em&gt;. MGM’s library also includes unscripted TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Voice &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon says the acquisition will “provide customers with greater access” to MGM’s works and “empower” the studio to continue its “great storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xL6skJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5th0"&gt;“The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team,” Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a statement. “It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrJrIu"&gt;Amazon’s media business has so far been a relatively small part of its overall empire, although it still spends billions on content each year. A substantial portion of Prime subscribers make use of the included free Prime Video streaming. Of the 200 million-plus people worldwide who are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-q1-2021-prime-video-viewers-1234963065/"&gt;over 175 million&lt;/a&gt; streamed video last year. Adding thousands more films and TV shows could be a boon for both figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lnNZQ"&gt;Reports of Amazon’s possible acquisition of MGM first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441330/amazon-mgm-offer"&gt;emerged in mid-May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-mgm-acquisition-talks-9-billion-1234975168/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was being negotiated by Hopkins. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-buy-hollywood-studio-mgm-11621880759"&gt;on May 24th&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon was nearing a deal to buy MGM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmj78M"&gt;MGM is currently owned by a collection of private equity firms, including Anchorage Capital Group, Highland Capital Management, and Solus Alternative Asset Management. Reports that MGM was up for sale &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mgm-holdings-studio-behind-james-bond-explores-a-sale-11608588732"&gt;emerged last December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epXi5p"&gt;The sale of MGM comes during a period of Hollywood consolidation, as companies attempt to beef up their content libraries to compete with Netflix and Disney. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T recently spun out its media business WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; to merge it with TV company Discovery, creating the world’s second largest media firm by revenue outside of Disney. Both companies have their own streaming services (HBO Max and Discovery Plus), raising the possibility of them being combined into a single, more substantial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJdz5Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="syhKkl"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones are a generation old at this point, but they still provide a comfortable fit, pleasant sound, and active noise cancellation.

&lt;p id="xVcWdn"&gt;The 2020 Roku Ultra may not be considered our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;favorite streaming device&lt;/a&gt;, however, it’s also not one to scoff at. It’s the most capable device in the Roku lineup, equipped with both a USB port for external media and an ethernet port for those times when your Wi-Fi is acting up or overloaded. It also supports a range of content, from 4K to HDR to Dolby Vision, and features quick performance, thanks to its quad-core processor.

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrXoCo"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; scammy app to have been unearthed by Elefheriou, who’s been waging a war against them after his own Apple Watch keyboard app, FlickType, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;overtaken by expensive apps&lt;/a&gt; with fake reviews. Eleftheriou says Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou#:~:text=eleftheriou%20tells%20me%20that%20apple%20has%20removed%20over%20100%20apps%20due%20to%20his%20reports%20%E2%80%94%20and%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20wondering%20whether%20his%20online%20crusade%20is%20personal%2C%20the%20answer%20is%20most%20definitely%20yes"&gt;removed over 100 apps&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his reports, but it’s concerning that the multi-billion dollar company isn’t catching these scams during its App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9o50E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you can trust App Store ratings, you haven’t been paying enough attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part? This trick is EXTREMELY easy for any developer to do, and not limited to this app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288722706489353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKwGD7"&gt;The UPNP Xtreme app’s behavior directly contradicts one of the best practices Apple lists on its developer site, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews"&gt;which states&lt;/a&gt; that developers should “avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app.” Generally, developers are allowed to prompt for a rating up to there times in a 365-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTXPiB"&gt;Apple’s review process has been under particularly intense scrutiny recently because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games’ lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Central to the dispute is the 30 percent commission Apple takes on many App Store payments and in-app purchases. Apple argues it needs the commission to run the App Store and create a safe environment for users. But that argument gets undermined pretty quickly if obvious scammy apps are able to slip through Apple’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoIyyV"&gt;Apps like the ones discovered by Eleftheriou not only harm customers who end up downloading scammy software and can get tricked into paying for difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. It also harms legitimate developers who have to contend with apps that are willing to play dirty to get the good reviews needed to rise up the App Store’s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEMtkm"&gt;Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit against Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it exploits its monopoly power over iOS app to make money at the expense of app developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will store Chinese car data locally, following government fears about spying</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K25mBm"&gt;Tesla says it’s established a data center in China to store and process information produced by its vehicles locally. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;made on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, comes as the US carmaker faces pressure from Chinese authorities over fears its cars could be used for spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHQDdT"&gt;“Car data security is very important,” said Tesla (via Google Translate). “All data generated from the sales of vehicles in the Chinese mainland market will be stored in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r3N7XI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telsa cars are reportedly banned from Chinese military sites&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNrDDv"&gt;Reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=mhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/tesla-cars-banned-by-china-s-military-on-concerns-about-cameras?sref=GYlFC92K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Tesla’s cars have been banned from Chinese military sites, and that “military staff and employees of key state-owned companies” are prohibited from owning the vehicles. Chinese authorities were reportedly concerned that the exterior cameras on the cars could be used to collect sensitive data and send it back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDR0oE"&gt;Elon Musk responded by saying if this was true it would be the end of the company in China. “There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/21/22343018/elon-musk-tesla-shut-down-cars-spying-china"&gt;said Musk in March&lt;/a&gt;. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52Lu6s"&gt;Tesla certainly needs to keep China happy to ensure the company’s future growth. China is the world’s largest market for electric vehicles — around three to four times the size of the the US. Tesla sold 147,445 cars in China last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk/musk-says-tesla-would-be-shut-down-if-its-cars-spied-in-china-elsewhere-idUSKBN2BC04Q"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for 30 percent of global sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X99nyr"&gt;Last month, the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-autos-data-idUSL1N2MM0O0"&gt;published draft rules&lt;/a&gt; outlining its concerns with data-collection by smart vehicles. The rules state that data about roads, buildings, and terrain should not leave the country, and that customers should have to consent to data collection. Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/tesla-gives-chinas-new-data-security-proposal-a-big-like/"&gt;expressed support for the rules&lt;/a&gt; through social media accounts in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIx6ws"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
