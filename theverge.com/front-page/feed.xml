    <title>Apple explains how the AirPods Max conserve battery life — with or without the case</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ckRZ6B"&gt;After some initial confusion around how the AirPods Max handle power management, Apple has tried to clarify the issue with &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211886"&gt;an updated support page&lt;/a&gt; outlining how and when its new $550 headphones automatically conserve battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyxn56"&gt;Originally, the company said that “when stored in their soft, slim smart case, AirPods Max enter an ultra‑low‑power state that preserves charge.” But there was uncertainty about what happens when they’re left &lt;em&gt;outside&lt;/em&gt; the case. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;In my review&lt;/a&gt;, I found that the headphones lost only a few battery percentage points when left out overnight with no case — nothing close to a worrying level of drain. But not everyone had that experience; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvvo6vUpJRc"&gt;Marques Brownlee&lt;/a&gt; observed a greater amount of battery loss when the AirPods Max were idle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UgLlfQ"&gt;According to Apple, the AirPods Max enter a “low power mode” when removed from your head and left stationary for five minutes outside of the case. If they’re left in that state for 72 hours, they go into a &lt;em&gt;lower&lt;/em&gt; power mode that switches off Bluetooth and features like Apple’s Find My location tracking. This, essentially, sounds like when they actually turn “off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgvvoN"&gt;But somewhat surprisingly, the smart case doesn’t immediately trigger this deeper sleep mode as quickly as I would’ve thought. Inserting the AirPods Max into the case puts them into that lighter low power mode right away. But it takes 18 hours of the headphones being in the smart case for them to enter the ultra-low power mode. When the case is factored in, Apple never mentions that the headphones have to be “stationary” to enter these modes. But the fact that it takes almost an entire 24 hours for the AirPods Max to hit that point where they maximize battery — even in the case — is a bit surprising to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnVW3m"&gt;Clearly, the company is prioritizing quick device reconnections and convenience over eking every last bit of battery out of the AirPods Max. One big question is what happens if the headphones are left worn around your neck when removed; since they’re not stationary in that scenario, my guess is that they remain fully active until taken off and put on a table or stand. It’s possible that Apple could adjust these default behaviors through firmware updates, but for now, this is how the AirPods Max work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18Qv0J"&gt;Even if I’ve seen minimal battery drain, and just as I say in our video review, I still wish they had a power button. For simplicity’s sake.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA will fly Orion deep-space crew capsule ‘as is,’ despite failed component</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dor0bnohP2ZyUY0vlxq9lw03dBs=/0x0:5040x3360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547603/KSC_20201028_PH_JBS01_0137_orig.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z0TMsK"&gt;NASA is opting to fly its future deep-space crew capsule Orion “as is” next year, after the agency discovered that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726753/nasa-orion-crew-capsule-power-unit-failure-artemis-i"&gt;one of the spacecraft’s power instruments had suffered a failure&lt;/a&gt;. Engineers had been mulling over whether to replace the instrument before the vehicle’s flight but ultimately decided that there was enough redundancy in the system to withstand the failed component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDvPKa"&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system, which has been through thousands of hours of powered operations and testing,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/artemis/2020/12/17/artemis-i-orion-progress-update/"&gt;the agency wrote in a blog post announcing the decision&lt;/a&gt;. “Engineers will perform additional testing and continue to monitor the health of the spacecraft while Orion is powered on to provide continued confidence in the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jOhTvM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“NASA has confidence in the health of the overall power and data system.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRTH1v"&gt;In November, engineers at NASA and Lockheed Martin, Orion’s primary contractor, found that part of an instrument known as a power and data unit, or PDU, had failed. One of eight PDUs on Orion, the instrument is needed for activating various functions while the capsule is in flight. It’s also in a fairly hard-to-reach place. This PDU is located in the adapter that connects the Orion capsule with its service module, a cylindrical trunk that supports the vehicle during flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4jedO"&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix. Engineers were looking at options that would have taken four to 12 months to complete. The fixes would have involved either taking apart the vehicle or tunneling through the outer walls to reach the PDU, and the extra time could have potentially caused a delay for Orion’s target launch date in November 2021. Instead, NASA has chosen not to replace the PDU. The instrument can still function; it just lost one of its power channels used for redundancy. That means this PDU will fly without a backup system in case its primary channel fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ie9Hil"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Replacing the PDU wouldn’t exactly be a quick fix&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4rVy4"&gt;NASA claims that fixing the PDU presented more risk than flying &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the PDU. “[Engineers] determined that due to the limited accessibility to this particular box, the degree of intrusiveness to the overall spacecraft systems, and other factors, the risk of collateral damage outweighed the risk associated with the loss of one leg of redundancy in a highly redundant system,” the agency wrote in its blog post. “Therefore, NASA has made the decision to proceed with vehicle processing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e3j4F"&gt;No people will be on board this Orion spacecraft when it flies. The vehicle is slated to fly uncrewed on top of NASA’s future massive rocket, the Space Launch System, or SLS. That rocket is also undergoing testing ahead of that flight, and it’s unclear if it will be ready by November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US plans major expansion of facial recognition authority at airports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6BCFT0WMI5-3sAu0FWVhEdiuQhE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547532/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W6SWkv"&gt;US Customs and Border Protection has filed for a significant expansion in its authority to conduct facial recognition at airports. On November 19th, the agency &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/11/19/2020-24707/collection-of-biometric-data-from-aliens-upon-entry-to-and-departure-from-the-united-states"&gt;submitted a filing to the Federal Register&lt;/a&gt; seeking to expand the ongoing biometric exit program, broadening the program’s scope to include all air and land ports. The filing also shifts the program’s focus entirely to facial recognition, at the expense of alternate methods like fingerprinting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPAodL"&gt;The filing is subject to public comment for a brief time after its submission. That comment period will end on Monday, December 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zFT8TE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All aliens may be required to be photographed upon entry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZBFmX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15332742/us-border-biometric-exit-facial-recognition-scanning-homeland-security"&gt;First deployed in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, biometric exit has operated as a pilot program, limited to a handful of ports in order to assess its viability, although customs officials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484581/us-airport-facial-recognition-departing-flights-biometric-exit"&gt;spoke openly about plans to expand it&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the pilot authorization, Customs officials could only collect data from select ports and travelers — but this new proposal would allow border agencies to expand the program at their own discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jcqRPw"&gt;“If this proposed rule is adopted as a final rule, CBP would continue to expand testing as necessary,” the filing reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5fOih"&gt;In particular, that will mean a blanket authorization to collect photographs of the faces of non-citizens. Under the new rule, anyone going through customs on the way in or out of the country should expect to have their face photographed and run through a facial recognition program. The system may also be used to identify US citizens, although they retain the option to opt out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yoOEcm"&gt;“This proposed rule provides that all aliens may be required to be photographed upon entry and/or departure,” the filing explains. “The use of facial recognition technology upon entry and departure will make the process for verifying an alien’s identity more efficient and accurate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3brAx"&gt;Initially proposed as a means to verify travelers’ identities and prevent visa fraud, the biometric exit program has expanded to include new measures to identify suspects of unrelated crimes. As &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-pia-cbp006-ats-december2019.pdf"&gt;the privacy assessment explains&lt;/a&gt;, the database that matches visa photographs to travelers “will also match those available photographs against available photographs associated with derogatory records, such as TECS lookout records, Terrorist Screening Data Base (TSDB) records, and outstanding wants and warrants.” Travelers with outstanding warrants will be flagged for further review by customs agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UlzHjU"&gt;It remains unclear how President-elect Biden will handle the expanding system when he takes office on January 20th. Biden was largely silent on facial recognition throughout his campaign and has not committed to a stance on the program. Earlier this month, a coalition of civil rights groups pushed the incoming president for stricter regulation of the technology &lt;a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/08/advocates-to-press-biden-congress-on-facial-recognition-curbs/"&gt;in an open letter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKxGnH"&gt;In June, lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303355/facial-recognition-ed-markey-ayanna-pressley-ban-federal-agencies-fed-law-enforcement"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; to ban facial recognition at the federal level, but the proposal has not moved forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRMQ2t"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAzjs8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0x9tc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>In 2020, live product launches turned into infomercials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Aq1uGK45AzLyJpC8pmeuQq5zcAM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547449/acastro_201207_4324_infomercials_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWImwY"&gt;In a year when the spread of COVID-19 made bringing large crowds together impossible, companies around the world had to reevaluate their love affair with the live product launch. Packing hundreds of attendees into extravagant venues to hang on every word of company executives was never going to be possible in an era of social distancing. Instead, events moved online, and many changed completely in the process as companies dropped risky product demonstrations in favor of slick prerecorded video segments. These events effectively turned from live launches into infomercials, and it makes me wonder how the likes of Apple, Amazon, Google, Sony, or Microsoft will be able to go back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRrRDC"&gt;It’s a striking change, thanks in part to how consistent the format for most launches has stayed over the last three decades. In 1984, Apple CEO Steve Jobs &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tQ5XwvjPmA"&gt;showed off the Macintosh’s features&lt;/a&gt; through onstage demonstrations, a slideshow presentation, and video segments like the famous &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zfqw8nhUwA"&gt;Ridley Scott-directed ad&lt;/a&gt;. Decades later, in 2019, the format had barely changed. When Apple CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6XBRvfupm0"&gt;launched the iPhone 11&lt;/a&gt; alongside a host of other devices last year, the budgets may have been bigger, the product list longer, and the demos more polished, but the whole event followed the same playbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mHJV2R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The format for products launches has been consistent for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uHYfIu"&gt;One day after Samsung held a similarly traditional in-person event in February to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guptCU6yUEk"&gt;unveil its Galaxy S20 smartphones&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21127754/mwc-2020-canceled-coronavirus-trade-show-phone-mobile-world-congress-gsma-statement"&gt;GSM Association canceled Mobile World Congress&lt;/a&gt;, an annual trade show that was due to take place in Barcelona. The announcement didn’t come out of the blue — multiple companies, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123169/lg-electronics-mwc-2020-cornavirus-cancel-withdraw-outbreak-concern"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/10/21131118/mwc-2020-coronavirus-intel-sony-amazon-cancel"&gt;Nvidia, Intel, Vivo, Sony, and Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, had already dropped out — but it made it clear to the industry that the days of business as usual were over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62ajMi"&gt;But even in a pandemic year, especially a year where many needed new equipment to adapt to new ways of working, gadgets still needed to come out. The question became &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;to launch them. Early on, many companies appeared to simply take the presentations they would have otherwise done in person and move them online. The reduced audience noise was the only hint that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4nFTqmuQxY"&gt;Huawei’s P40 series launch event in March&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t happening in a typical room full of journalists, while &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOWVrkL_DEE&amp;amp;t=1209s"&gt;OnePlus was more upfront about the empty auditorium in which it launched its 8 series&lt;/a&gt;. Sony didn’t even bother with a big empty room for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ph8LyNIT9sg&amp;amp;t=513s"&gt;PS5 Game Developers Conference presentation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it opted to have the console’s lead system architect, Mark Cerny, outline its capabilities in front of what appeared to be a green screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D74V8K"&gt;Before long, however, companies were experimenting with formats that would have never been possible with an in-person audience. Samsung, for example, had giant augmented reality versions of its devices appear during its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/KnkckgwLcV8?t=508"&gt;August Unpacked event live stream&lt;/a&gt; for its onstage presenters to pretend to gawp at. The presentation may have been happening live, but these elements wouldn’t have been possible with a regular audience present.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Oexepa3emEXVjYuu4z8-l3uSus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159720/msedge_IHNfdSlQh9.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmS5rlX9cDA&amp;amp;t=4686s" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Visual flourishes like this would be impossible during an in-person event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4fAy7o"&gt;No one shifted quicker or more completely to a new presentation style than Apple. Its live product launches gave way to streamlined prerecorded presentations filled with computer-generated graphs and sweeping transitions around the firm’s monolithic donut-shaped headquarters (often nicknamed “the spaceship”). The first of these was its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Q8AKghK44M"&gt;Worldwide Developers Conference keynote in June&lt;/a&gt;, but it used similar formats for its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMk1PYowq8M&amp;amp;t=8s"&gt;trio&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpw_z9vBPAE&amp;amp;t=4s"&gt;hardware&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umoEDgl_xBo&amp;amp;t=3s"&gt;launches&lt;/a&gt; later in the year. Other companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaBXd-96uNg&amp;amp;t=10s"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSE1Ya_xOoY&amp;amp;t=488s"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, followed suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpVMKZ"&gt;They may have changed their launches primarily for health and safety, but they gained a lot from their new approach. Presentations could be more dynamic and densely packed with information as they were honed to their essential elements. These new launches were also less reliant on the often-shaky onstage charisma of company executives. But most importantly, these presentations removed the possibility of anything &lt;em&gt;going wrong&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C4TrvN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prerecording a presentation removes the possibility of things going wrong&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IzHFB2"&gt;The tech world has a long and illustrious history of onstage mishaps — whether it’s an &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-42614281"&gt;LG robot that repeatedly fails to respond to commands&lt;/a&gt;, the Tesla Cybertruck’s supposedly bulletproof glass that &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/m7atGkba-Z8?t=72"&gt;smashed not once but twice&lt;/a&gt; after being hit by a ball bearing, Apple’s new facial recognition security &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TLMpuZp4iw"&gt;failing to recognize faces&lt;/a&gt;, or Microsoft’s speech recognition technology &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8oYoYy2Gc"&gt;failing to recognize speech&lt;/a&gt;. Live demonstrations always carry the risk of things going sideways. Sometimes nothing goes wrong onstage at all, but an audience’s laughter will shatter the illusion that $999 is a reasonable price to pay &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuW4Suo4OVg"&gt;for a monitor stand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poPv1t"&gt;But the risk of failure means a live demonstration is that much more impressive when it goes right, like Google’s demonstration of its Glass eyewear at its I/O developer conference &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7TB8b2t3QE"&gt;back in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. “This can go wrong in about 500 different ways,” was how Google co-founder Sergey Brin introduced the demo, which saw a group &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/27/3121164/project-glass-demo-io"&gt;live-stream their skydive&lt;/a&gt; down to San Francisco’s Moscone Center using Google Glass. It was an excessive, over-the-top display, but it left little doubt that the device was capable of what Google showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sccj7O"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7TB8b2t3QE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=524&amp;amp;start=524" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ryY5CU"&gt;Few launches are as over-the-top as this, but everything from a demonstration of a voice assistant to new augmented reality developer tools is made that little bit more believable by watching it happen live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="siAiSw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Live” doesn’t guarantee “real,” but it helps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kR5KnF"&gt;And yet, a live demonstration is no guarantee of authenticity. Take the presenters who played &lt;em&gt;Kinect Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; at Microsoft’s E3 press conference in 2010, who appeared to be &lt;a href="https://www.mcvuk.com/business-news/publishing/e3-2010-star-wars-kinect-video/"&gt;miming along with the on-screen action&lt;/a&gt; rather than controlling it directly. Other showcases give unfinished products a bit of a helping hand, like when the original iPhone’s antennas had to be &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/magazine/and-then-steve-said-let-there-be-an-iphone.html#after-story-ad-2:~:text=The%20software%20in%20the%20iPhone%E2%80%99s%20Wi%2DFi,wouldn%E2%80%99t%20have%20to%20travel%20as%20far."&gt;connected to wires running offstage&lt;/a&gt; during its 2007 unveiling to make up for its unstable Wi-Fi radio software. In some cases, we’re so conditioned to expect trickery that an onstage hiccup can actually make a presentation more impressive by revealing that it’s being done for real, like when &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4 &lt;/em&gt;co-director Bruce Straley found himself onstage &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/20/8817971/uncharted-4-e3-demo-blooper-snafu-gaffe"&gt;without the controller to actually play the game&lt;/a&gt; at Sony’s E3 presentation. The resulting 30 seconds of idle animation was enough to prove that the subsequent gameplay was definitely being played live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjhyIQ"&gt;Live demos don’t prove that what you’re seeing is real, but they’re still a lot more believable than something prepared ahead of time. A prerecorded infomercial just doesn’t have the same stakes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/peIeoOEkrFTQ2e_USYh2TppYDHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159748/msedge_BlyQF5A9fz.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AwdkGKmZ0I" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was harder to believe Apple’s performance claims based on a prerecorded presentation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Q9LqJ"&gt;In 2020, every presentation went off without a hitch, but it was hard not to doubt what we were being shown. Apple attempted to re-create some of the impact of a live event &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GEZhD3J89ZE?t=5718"&gt;during its WWDC 2020 presentation&lt;/a&gt; when Craig Federighi revealed that a previous macOS Big Sur demonstration had &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; taken place on Macs running Apple Silicon rather than Intel chips. But considering any crashes or hitches could have been easily edited out, the revelation didn’t have the same impact as it would have. Most remained skeptical of the company’s claims until they were actually able to use the laptops for themselves months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KL1ozA"&gt;2020’s shift in product launches saw companies trade risky live demonstrations for tightly scripted videos. The question now is how quickly they’ll want to go back when it’s safe to do so. For some, I suspect the control they’ve had this year will be hard to give up. They’ll have seen how consistent and reliable a virtual launch can be, and the idea of returning to the unpredictability of doing things live won’t seem worth the effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2441uH"&gt;Personally, I hope most companies avoid the temptation. Live launches might be fraught, logistical nightmares, but they’re also an opportunity to have a real impact and show why a new device, service, or game is actually worth paying attention to. Journalists will always exist to eventually separate reality from marketing, but a show-stopping event can be the thing that gets people interested enough to read a review in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Final Fantasy VII Remake is my game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FF7 remake" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lL6auKQeeoBG6ywi03rl9b4kAR4=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547445/18_Event_Cloud.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yX6qDV"&gt;I spent a lot of time in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake &lt;/em&gt;looking up. In Midgar, the sky is obstructed by metal plates, physical barriers that separate downtrodden citizens from their wealthy counterparts. It’s a quiet reminder that in this place, no one is free. People’s paths are already written. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGAUqu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; is just that: a retelling of the iconic 1997 Japanese roleplaying game that made &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; a household name. Cloud Strife, a brooding mercenary with a spotty past, becomes entangled with Avalanche, a radical group fighting against an evil corporation with aspirations that are destroying the planet. It’s a journey from Midgar, the bustling metropolis in which the game is initially set, to a globe-trotting adventure that winds through characters’ pasts as much as it does their troubled futures. Oh, and there’s an evil guy with gravity-defying bangs and a sword bigger than his body. It’s kind of a theme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jkTNvt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It makes the original game look like a blueprint&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t92Eko"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;FFVII Remake &lt;/em&gt;is not the complete story of the original game. It’s barely the first act. The game is set entirely in Midgar, with Square Enix opting to blow out an experience that was previously a few hours long into a full game — an episodic take that shouldn’t work and yet… does. &lt;em&gt;FFVII Remake &lt;/em&gt;is not just a big-budget paint job; it’s an entirely new retelling that feels lovingly made. It makes the original game look like a blueprint of what its story was always meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UAG8G"&gt;There is so much to see and do in Midgar, whether it’s running requests for oddly named intern Chadley, rescuing cats, learning how to dance in drag, motorcycle fights, or just spending time with the game’s endearing cast. The city feels alive in a way the original game could never achieve. Characters who were barely given any screentime two decades ago, like the eternally thirsty Avalanche member Jessie, now feel like carefully considered personalities. &lt;em&gt;FFVII Remake&lt;/em&gt; breathes new life into its crew, whether it’s Cloud hurriedly admitting he looks &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldqgR4lY0VE"&gt;great in a dress&lt;/a&gt; or the game’s sweet flower girl Aerith &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gH8LT8Bma4"&gt;swearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IZGzF"&gt;But Square Enix is interested in more than just the story it originally created. &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;’s final act twists the narrative fans have always known in a strange, yet thrilling metatextual way. Cloud and his friends aren’t just fighting against fate; they’re battling the preconceived notions of the very fans who’ve idolized them. In the game’s final moments, it focuses on an unobstructed sky. The future is, for the first time in decades, unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ShJaFY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbxjC8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Creating visual metaphors: Alex Castro’s illustration tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="photoshop gfx" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VH3RuslGJN1IMagMIAtRwyRriqg=/103x0:918x543/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547238/photoshop_gfx_06.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLHs8W"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is a place where stories are told, they wouldn’t be nearly as interesting if it weren’t for the artwork that accompanies them. Alex Castro is the illustrator for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and he is the best person to describe how his work complements our reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63kwhE"&gt;What follows are Alex’s thoughts about the tools he prefers to use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UsDbfw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illustration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BfdH1z"&gt;I’ve heard illustrations described as “visual metaphors” that reflect the meaning of the words. I create artwork for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; articles that communicates the sentiments of a story and catches the reader’s eye. Sometimes, it’s creating batches of simple graphics that could be used for a number of stories. Other times, it’s reading and rereading reports and features trying to dissect what the main takeaways of the stories are and creating visuals specifically for them. Often the hardest part of a project is the initial brainstorming when I’m extracting themes and attempting to translate them into visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="LONRLE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10226130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DpL2mA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you need&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6TWbuD"&gt;An illustration setup can be as simple as a laptop or as elaborate as an independent art studio, filled with art supplies and tools. It really depends on the style of work. Many digital artists make use of drawing tablets and displays in order to draw directly into their computer software of choice. I do most of my work on the computer, so I tend to not have too much around me. I like to keep a sketchbook and pen handy in order to sketch ideas down quickly or take quick notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XaFaXt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer, tablet, and sketchbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mC6Lnz"&gt;When we were in the office, I worked on a &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fimac%2F27-inch&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;27-inch iMac&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Drawing-Graphic-Pressure-Levels-DTK2260K0A/dp/B07TR7YQ8Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4a8f37749a9eeeb7d895e7df24a3452d&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;22-inch Wacom Cintiq&lt;/a&gt; drawing tablet. Since I’ve been working from home, I’ve switched to my &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-Gaming-PC-Desktop-Aurora/dp/B076BHG74V/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ddc96d9a29fa4eaba45c6455f79381cc&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Alienware Aurora R7&lt;/a&gt; system and purchased a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Drawing-Monitor-Function-Battery-Free-Pressure/dp/B07FQFQVRJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=78a96d685868fb4be24393ce51b72e0e&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;19.5-inch Huion Kamvas Pro&lt;/a&gt; drawing tablet, which I don’t love as much as the Cintiq, but it’s a great budget option. I also have used a &lt;a href="https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-tablets/wacom-intuos"&gt;Wacom Intuos&lt;/a&gt; tablet, and sometimes I prefer its workflow over the display tablets since I don’t have to be hunched over the display to draw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4Qxmz7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232708"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mOtBEa"&gt;Regardless of what computer I’m using, I always have a pen and sketchbook handy. It’s much easier for me to brainstorm when I’m able to scribble all of my ideas freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BBcI5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photoshop and added apps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpZSWk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fplans.html%3Ffilter%3Dphotography%26plan%3Dindividual&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Photoshop&lt;/a&gt; is my go-to for all of my artwork, as I’ve been using it since I was nine years old. It serves as the main hub for my work. Then I bring in assets from other software like &lt;a href="https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d"&gt;Cinema 4D&lt;/a&gt;, where I create 3D objects, and Illustrator, where I can design high-res logos and icons. When animating or compositing video, I’ll jump into &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Faftereffects.html&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;After Effects&lt;/a&gt;, which allows me to put together layers of video. I also use Photoshop plugins such as &lt;a href="https://topazlabs.com/studio/"&gt;Topaz Studio&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://nikcollection.dxo.com/"&gt;Nik Collection&lt;/a&gt; to apply effects like AI-generated paint strokes, lens distortion, and double exposure. I usually paint these effects in using a layer mask in order to use them more as finishing touches rather than large overall effects. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lmHbOAXIAo6grXwegaVeXvFSYNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168760/instagram_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Sometimes Alex will create the foundation of an image in Cinema 4D, then layer on top of it in Photoshop. A good example is this &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; illustration for a feature on a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;lost &lt;/em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rDpJRHH9mZtEefVt9sWRyYKocc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22168761/instagram_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Other times, Alex will create images in Photoshop then build 3D assets around it, trying to match depth and perspective. This is what he did for this single cover for rapper KB, using a photo of him performing on tour as a base. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WUFUA7"&gt;When working on user interface designs, I usually use &lt;a href="https://www.figma.com/"&gt;Figma&lt;/a&gt;, a web-based design software specifically made for interactive design. I really love its vector editing features, sometimes preferring it to Illustrator. For projects that could use some 3D work, I’ll occasionally use &lt;a href="https://www.blender.org/"&gt;Blender&lt;/a&gt; instead of Cinema 4D. I personally prefer it to Cinema 4D, but since our team here doesn’t use it, I have to be proficient in both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nbxSNG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10232774"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IX1UMe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For beginners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="colf48"&gt;If you’re just starting out, I think the cheaper Wacom tablets are a great start for any beginner digital artist. As far as software tools are concerned, I think Photoshop is a must-learn. &lt;a href="https://www.gimp.org/"&gt;GIMP&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://krita.org/en/"&gt;Krita&lt;/a&gt; are said to be great free alternatives, but I admit I’m not very familiar with them.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon launches group video and audio calling for Echo devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NMIB0UguqCfmiemsRhcmdoVqiBM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547236/groupcallingalexa.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Group calling on an Echo Show.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgcjpM"&gt;Amazon is launching a new group video or audio calling feature for Echo devices today, just in time for the holidays. Originally announced back in September, group calling will allow up to seven participants to join an audio or video call on supported Echo devices like the Echo, Echo Dot, and Echo Show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrqMms"&gt;Echo owners will be able to create and name groups using the Alexa app, and Amazon is also planning to support group calling through its Alexa app soon. You’ll be able to add adult contacts into groups, and friends and family will have to opt in to be part of group calling. This new feature also supports Alexa commands like “Alexa, call my family” to connect to a group you’ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cF62o1"&gt;Echo group calling could be a good alternative to Zoom and other video calling services. There are no limits on call times, allowing Echo owners to make or receive voice and video calls freely. Without the Alexa app supporting group calling, it’s limited to requiring hardware for now, though. Zoom has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22176502/zoom-lifting-40-minute-meeting-limit-holidays-free-hanukkah-christmas-eve-new-years-kwanzaa"&gt;started lifting its 40-minute meeting limit&lt;/a&gt; for several upcoming holidays, and rivals like Microsoft Teams have also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/20/21579076/microsoft-teams-free-video-calling-web-zoom-competition"&gt;all-day video calling free&lt;/a&gt; without limits via the web. Google also offering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;unlimited Meet calls&lt;/a&gt; until March 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ps9ER3"&gt;Amazon is launching its group calling feature today in Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Spain, the US, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The weirdest pop culture of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZOCgNw5L8DscmfyBYPs-mLUWtoM=/81x0:983x601/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68547131/Baby_Yoda_eggs_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Lucasfilm, Ltd.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WwPbC"&gt;2020 has been a strange year, by nearly any metric you choose to use. And that weirdness has bled over to pop culture, as the seemingly endless news cycles of disasters, the ongoing global pandemic, the turmoil of the US elections, the rise of TikTok, the dearth of traditional releases of big movies, and just so many memes resulted in a year of cultural moments that awed, amazed, and just straight-up confused us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OaSPd"&gt;It was a year that seemed almost determined to constantly one-up itself on nonsensical events, each headline more impossible than the last. And faced with all that frightening reality, is it any wonder that the weirdness of 2020’s culture became almost a mirror reflection of the year itself? When the world gets strange, sometimes the only answer is to seek out things that are even stranger — if only to reassure ourselves that we’re not quite at rock bottom just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifNXrd"&gt;Here are some of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rEfSV0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqg48h_uKYM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u9hV6f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class Action Park&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; — This is a documentary about a penny-stock-mogul-funded New Jersey theme park called Action Park which was — due to a combination of a laissez-faire regulatory enforcement and a teen workforce — particularly bizarre and at times, deadly. To get to the go-karts, for instance, you had to go through the beer tent. (One of the highlights of the documentary is discovering Action Park was too weird for Donald Trump to invest in.) The rides were designed by amateurs and tested by the park’s workforce. Stories of lost teeth, bloodied knees, and other battle scars abound. Eventually, the park had to buy its own ambulances. The ride-by-ride story of the park, as told by people who went there, starts as a lark, but as the movie progresses, the viewer begins to realize they are in fact watching a horror film. The documentary itself isn’t that weird — it’s brilliantly done — but the subject matter is so strange it can only possibly have existed in America. Specifically, in the part of America that is New Jersey. — &lt;em&gt;Liz Lopatto&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

It started when just one lone TikToker, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/anEmilyJacobsen/status/1336789469018681344"&gt;Emily Jacobsen&lt;/a&gt;, posted a video singing an ode to the cooking rat. It quickly exploded after another TikTok user, Daniel Mertzlufft, remixed that song into a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@danieljmertzlufft/video/6885475193410620678?referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.playbill.com%2F&amp;amp;referer_video_id=6885475193410620678"&gt;full Broadway number&lt;/a&gt;, and it now has dozens of videos across the internet with additional musical numbers, set designs, playbill programs, elaborately choreographed dance numbers, stage directions, giant rat costumes, and more. The whole thing has even broken free of TikTok into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166215/ratatouille-the-tiktok-musical-broadway-show-todaytix-streaming-one-night-date-viral-disney"&gt;one-night-only benefit concert&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a bizarre, wonderful culmination of how the internet can come together to make something beautiful — even if it’s just a made-up musical. — &lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J0cGIj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“I hope this email finds you well in these strange times.” &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It’s reassuring that even when normal life all but disappears, you can still count on a daily deluge of emails in your inbox. But how do you start a message when the person on the other end of it could be experiencing anything from feeling a little cooped up from working from home for too long to being in any number of far worse professional or personal situations. The solution, of course, is the ever-reliable “I hope this email finds you well in these X times” opener. Just replace X depending on your mood, whether it’s “unprecedented,” “difficult,” or just plain “strange.” — &lt;em&gt;Jon Porter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="neuxtb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four Seasons Total Landscaping &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;It started as a series of incredulous tweets from political reporters in Pennsylvania covering President Trump’s legal efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election — “Is Donald Trump convening the world’s press at a small landscaping company on the outskirts of Philadelphia?” — and it ended as one of the strangest, uncomfortable, and most meme-worthy turns in an already unorthodox election season. The Trump team’s unexplained decision to hold an off-the-rails press conference declaring election fraud at a nondescript landscaping company located on a highway in between a sex shop and a crematorium has since spawned Zoom backgrounds, a VR hangout for furries, and, naturally, a whole bunch of merch. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GRT7aP"&gt;Whether or not Trump thought he was actually booking the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia hardly seems to matter anymore. And since Rudy Giuliani and others graced it with their smarmy presence, the landscaping company has become a tourist attraction, a curiosity in a year already replete with strange goings-on. To their credit, Four Seasons Total Landscaping is doing their best to ride it out, leveraging their newfound infamy for good by selling official merch and retweeting the best quotes to show they’re in on the joke. The conspiracy theorists, though, are doing their best to slander the company as DNC money launderers, or worse, vote stealers. (Seriously.) Let’s hope the company can ignore the threats and get back to blowing leaves in the near future. — &lt;em&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="bd8gFY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How To with John Wilson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;Maybe it’s my nostalgia for being able to freely walk around New York City, but HBO’s &lt;em&gt;How To with John Wilson &lt;/em&gt;is the closest thing that comes to the joys of real-life people-watching. The show is largely footage of strangers around Manhattan, chopped up into short clips —glimpses, really— and strung together by awkward voiceover meditations from Wilson himself. The concept might resemble a bad student film uploaded to Vimeo (actually, his early work &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; on Vimeo), but the vignettes escalate to something unexpected and, at times, profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgPPax"&gt;An episode about improving memory ends up taking Wilson to Idaho, where he attends a conference of narcissistic believers of the Mandela effect. One episode, the fourth, titled “How to Cover Your Furniture,” was about exactly that. Then I looked away for a moment, and when my eyes returned to the screen, there was Wilson, interviewing a man attempting to elongate the foreskin of his penis with a weighted contraption in his pants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dip5zf"&gt;A normal stroll through a city isn’t as eventful or cohesive an experience as the one John Wilson delivers in any given episode of &lt;em&gt;How To&lt;/em&gt;. But watching the show will leave you with the comforting feeling that New York is bustling, big, and full of strange people and possibilities. At any point, you might catch Kyle MacLachlan at the subway station, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvNUgOb1RzY"&gt;struggling to swipe his MetroCard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;— Kevin Nguyen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gpgthP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby Yoda eating Frog Lady’s babies &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(This entry includes spoilers for the current season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUkTea"&gt;We know space is a cold, empty vacuum where no one can hear you scream, but then &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt; brought us the wide-eyed visage of Baby Yoda to make it slightly less awful. So the sight of the beloved green creature — official name Grogu — slurping down the eggs of a desperate Frog Lady hit fans of the show hard. She was trying to take the last of her brood to her home planet to avoid the extinction of her species. The backlash was swift: He’s a murderer! He killed her babies! It’s genocide! One &lt;a href="https://ew.com/tv/the-mandalorian-baby-yoda-eating-controversy/"&gt;Lucasfilm exec tweeted&lt;/a&gt; that the eggs were unfertilized “like the chicken eggs many of us enjoy,” and that Baby Yoda eating them was “intentionally disturbing for comedic effect.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5h8pK"&gt;Yes, but, the show introduced the unfertilized eggs as the last hope for the Frog species, the whole purpose of the two-part mission that nearly got Mando and the Razor Crest eaten by frost spiders. They were important and probably shouldn’t have been used as props for “comedic effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7kzXa"&gt;To be perfectly honest, it raised more questions (for me, at least) about the people in charge of watching the eggs than the hungry baby who ate them. Wouldn’t Frog Lady notice there were eggs missing? Shouldn’t there have been some kind of child-proof lock on the egg container? And doesn’t Mando ever feed the poor kid? We find out in subsequent episodes that he does, but he should think about packing some string cheese and crackers for the kid next time. Because for parents of small children on a long road trip, this is the way (to avoid a cranky kid meltdown). — &lt;em&gt;Kim Lyons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0g9d4MBh9Jq-txBfKD_0mvH90Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173026/Screen_Shot_2020_12_15_at_4.51.11_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hZeu2g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Felton’s DracoTok obsession is also my obsession &lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;I’ve pretty much done nothing other than have an endless stream of Netflix running on my TV and TikTok running on my phone. TikTok goes through rapid waves of trends. Something is hot for a minute and then it disappears, as is life on the internet. One thing that stuck around, however, and I can’t peel my eyes away from is &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/dracotok?lang=en"&gt;DracoTok&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XU4GXm"&gt;DracoTok is this beautiful wholesome world that my 12-year-old, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter-&lt;/em&gt;fanfiction-writing self would likely cry over. Tom Felton, who played Slytherin prince Draco Malfoy in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;films, joined TikTok at the height of 20- and 30-somethings rekindling their obsession with the series through cringe-inducing posts about being in love with Draco Malfoy. Most actors would ignore these types of sentiments that people post without really understanding the concept of going viral (no one ever thinks they’re going to go viral, and I imagine most people instantly regret it the second it happens), but Felton has jumped in and embraced it! He’s kick-started contests looking for the best version of Malfoy’s “Potter!” bark. He duets with TikTok creators roleplaying their love for Draco. From thousands of miles away, he cheers on people’s deepest obsession with his &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;character — and it’s positively charming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nnEbH"&gt;Everything about it is so inherently dumb, but it’s the heartwarming, fluffy, absurdly adorable type of dumb that I really needed this year. If you were a &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter &lt;/em&gt;kid or are a fan today, I highly recommend tuning into Felton’s ongoing saga of trying to hype up his fans while also being a dork himself. Guaranteed smile. — &lt;em&gt;Julia Alexander &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sarah Cooper reflects on her whirlwind 2020 of Trump impressions</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Here’s what happens when a product designer becomes a creator&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RLg2i3"&gt;If you were on social media — &lt;em&gt;any &lt;/em&gt;social media — in 2020, you probably saw a video of Sarah Cooper lip-syncing to President Donald Trump’s public appearances. And while her early videos were &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme?lang=en"&gt;made using TikTok&lt;/a&gt;, they migrated to Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. As the year ends, Cooper has a Netflix special called &lt;em&gt;Everything’s Fine&lt;/em&gt; under her belt and is developing TV shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKiUYG"&gt;Before all that, though, there was TikTok, perhaps best thought of as a video editing tool with a distribution network conveniently attached. Cooper tried it out, with stupendous results. Though she’d previously written two books, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/100-Tricks-Appear-Smart-Meetings/dp/1449476058?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;100 Tricks to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GF3C6Y8/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Be Successful Without Hurting Men’s Feelings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;it was her madcap take on Trump — the president as bad boss — that launched her into celebrity status. Cooper brought the observational style she honed working at companies like Google and Flickr to her study of Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="E8y4bA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DzSVDm"&gt;“Trump is a prime example of how the people at the top influence everyone beneath them,” Cooper says. ”And that’s kind of true for companies. You see how the CEO acts. You see how leadership acts, and everybody imitates that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSYfNg"&gt;Unlike many other product designers, Cooper now finds herself on the other end of products — as a creator. It’s hard to monetize on TikTok and virtually impossible on Twitter, where Cooper feels her community is. Of all the platforms, YouTube was the one that gave her a financial windfall when she posted her videos. “It was really more like an afterthought, but in terms of monetization, it’s the only place really to make money with videos,” Cooper says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fzwDLa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme/video/6819061413877763334" data-video-id="6819061413877763334" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@whatchugotforme" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@whatchugotforme"&gt;@whatchugotforme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6819046896666004229"&gt;♬ original sound - Sarah Cooper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wlv8xz"&gt;Moving to Netflix was similarly surreal — Cooper remembers when Netflix was just a DVD-by-mail startup. Now, of course, the company produces original content, including her own, which was produced by Natasha Lyonne and Maya Rudolph and full of celebrity cameos. “I completely clammed up with Jon Hamm because I’ve watched every season of &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, like twice,” Cooper says. Also, she regrets not asking Winona Ryder what filming &lt;em&gt;Edward Scissorhands&lt;/em&gt; was like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUI9Nj"&gt;But, of course, the production was shot during the COVID-19 pandemic, with on-set tests, a virus scare, and Zoom meetings. “Everything was on Zoom, which is sad because I think Google Hangouts is a pretty good tool,” Cooper says. “I was on Hangouts at Google all the time.” We asked her to reflect on her whirlwind year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOcnTj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ2enk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had a big 2020. How are you thinking about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMh5UM"&gt;It’s been the biggest year of my career. I’m actually working on things, for the first time in my life, that I’m so excited to be working on. I’m doing right now, what I’ve always, always wanted to do. And so it’s just weird to feel that way about this year, but then also feel like, fuck 2020. Can’t wait until it’s over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="p3njEj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Work is just this fascinating place.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgDGAG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work seems like your most important subject. From &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Appear Smart in Meetings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, there’s a through-line to Trump. How did your interest in workplace dynamics play a role in what you’ve created?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m71T7F"&gt;I fought it for a long time because I thought it wasn’t cool to talk about work. But work is just this fascinating place. At first, when I started making the Trump videos, I didn’t really know how they fit in with everything else I was doing. Then looking back, it was like, “Oh yeah, everything he does is this performance that he’s putting on&lt;em&gt;.” &lt;/em&gt;That’s the through-line of everything that I do. We’re all sort of putting on a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc86JK"&gt;I had this idea when I was like 21 that I was going to make a blog called My Life on Stage, because I always felt like I was performing, wherever I went. Work is just, it’s like a prime place for that kind of thing. Especially in tech, because you’re there because you’re being paid, because it’s a job. But in tech, you’re also supposed to be very passionate and excited about everything, constantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mk9rwZ"&gt;That was kind of what led to me leaving Google really. I felt like I was living this double life. I was so much more passionate about writing than I was about what I was doing at work. And yet I had to be a manager, which means being a cheerleader, which means talking about how this is the greatest thing we’re doing... The project we’re working on right now is so important and it’s going to change the world and all of these things. And I just didn’t feel that way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AItAMx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m really curious about how your background as a designer informed your approach to social media platforms. How did you think about trying to build an audience?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZRzo1k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c2qa6D"&gt;Well, I’ve been trying to build an audience for a very long time. It’s just been a process of like, building an audience and kind of getting bored with something and then rebuilding and rebuilding and rebuilding. I was always just trying new platforms, new video platforms, new ways to share ideas online. I just tried everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5192g"&gt;I had my own blog for a while, thecooperreview.com. One thing I noticed from creating blogs is that it’s really hard to create an audience from scratch, even when the blog went viral. A lot of these social platforms just have built-in ways of sharing and built-in ways of creating audiences. So I realized it was a lot easier to try to build an audience through Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIX4RI"&gt;That’s kind of why I tried TikTok. Everybody was doing it and I had nothing better to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQBeEy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You moved away from using the TikTok editing tool. When did that happen and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGn56N"&gt;TikTok’s [editing tool is] very chronological. I have different characters in my videos and it’s not like I could shoot all of one character, all of the other character, and then edit them together. It was really like me sequentially, like, now I’m Trump, now I’m the person responding to Trump, now I’m Trump again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hnBc0z"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ic8WWdYldVg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9whupN"&gt;But when I wanted to do anything that was longer than 60 seconds, it was just more complicated. I think the first one I did, on my own, without TikTok, was Don Jr. interviewing his dad for Father’s Day. Then I did “person, woman, two man camera” and that was just a longer video, almost two minutes. You can’t make anything over 60 seconds on TikTok, so I just had my own little hacky way of lip-syncing and recording myself and then editing it in Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdXaHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you think about moving your audience from social networks to Netflix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QzT8GW"&gt;A long time ago, I wanted to make a video making fun of how Gary Vaynerchuk is on YouTube telling people to follow him on Twitter. And he’s on Twitter telling people to follow his Facebook. And then he’s on Facebook telling people to follow... So, he’s just like trying to get people to follow him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1voL3w"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B2qIgE"&gt;I just don’t think that works. I feel like you need to meet people where they are and if people are on YouTube, bring your stuff to YouTube, and let them view it on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIVqRj"&gt;With Netflix, it was just funny because I’d be on a call with Netflix marketing, and they’d be telling me about personalization and how their platform works and stuff like that. When I worked in tech, I used to design personalization features. It’s really interesting, being on these different sides of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUI9sM"&gt;I’d worked at Flickr and I left Flickr to do acting. I was doing a little bit of modeling and I had a photographer teach me how to use a feature in Flickr that I designed. It’s kind of cool, seeing the other side of it, coming from a perspective of like, first I was designing these experiences, and now I’m creating content for these experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08WMrf"&gt;It gives me a better understanding of how things work. Like, how to caption things so that people will be intrigued by them — so that you don’t give it away, but you pique their interest. And all of these things, I feel like I’ve honed over the decades I’ve wasted in social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Waw1yE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the most extreme example of dogfooding I think I’ve ever heard of. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyEd4n"&gt;Cut to doing the Netflix special, where I was doing the &lt;em&gt;Access Hollywood&lt;/em&gt; bus scene with Dame Helen Mirren and trying to teach her how to TikTok. I would kill to be Dame Helen Mirren! And she’s like, “How do I lip sync? And I’m like, “Why am I teaching you how to lip-sync? You should not be lip-syncing. You’re Shakespearean-trained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ivZiXV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRu-QUeqoMs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e8sluJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Netflix special would have been a time crunch in any year. But we also have a pandemic. How did that affect filming? How did that affect the collaboration?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADt1V7"&gt;Not only was it my first special; it was my first COVID production. It was a lot of people’s first COVID production. There were a lot of masks. There was a COVID specialist on set. There was a lot of like, “Hey, you guys are too close.” Or, “Do you need some hand sanitizer?” Constant COVID tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frRRGw"&gt;The last day, I walked onto set, and they took my temperature. I had a temperature, and I was like, “Oh my God, I’m trying so hard not to get sick,” because I didn’t want to shut down this whole production. And now on the last day, I have a temperature! But it turned out I was just standing in the sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c57b9o"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you focusing on television, or will we still see you on social media?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="voprvC"&gt;I’ll always be on Twitter. I can never get away, for some reason. For the foreseeable future, I’m going to be focused on TV. But I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get away from social media. Plus, I think it’s HBO Max, is now going to be releasing all their films, simultaneously, online as well as in theaters. And so, all these big movie stars are all internet stars now. We’re just all on the internet now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ouI13Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boba Fett show heading to Disney Plus in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8uu4li"&gt;After years of speculation about whether Boba Fett would get his own spinoff of some kind, &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s season 2 finale confirmed that a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542557/the-mandalorian-season-2-premiere-review-disney-plus"&gt;Boba Fett series&lt;/a&gt; will hit Disney Plus in December 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZNuMg"&gt;The show, &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, was not included as an announcement during Disney’s big investor day last week. Several &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;other &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; projects&lt;/a&gt;, including two &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;spinoffs — an Ahsoka Tano show and &lt;em&gt;Rangers of the New Republic &lt;/em&gt;—&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a Lando Calrissian show, and a &lt;em&gt;Star Wars &lt;/em&gt;anime, were announced last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="joYKx4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning: The following contains light spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s second season finale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhCn1x"&gt;The announcement comes during a post-credits scene (ah, yes, the post-credits scenes), which finds Boba Fett and Fennec Shand in Jabba the Hutt’s palace. Fans will recall this is where Boba Fett was thrown into the sarlacc pit a few years before. Now, Boba Fett is back — and after blasting away Bib Fortuna, the pasty-faced employee of Jabba the Hutt who gave me nightmares as a child — Boba Fett takes his place on Jabba’s throne. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY900i"&gt;Wild! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVD4mi"&gt;We’re operating under the assumption that this is a spinoff series, but it &lt;em&gt;could theoretically &lt;/em&gt;be the name of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;’s third season. The “Mandalorian” could refer to any of the armored warriors, like Boba Fett or even Bo-Katan. Still, the scene announcing the assumed spinoff series will come as a nice surprise for anyone who held out hope for a Boba Fett movie years ago when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13926062/star-wars-rogue-one-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/15/17355964/solo-a-star-wars-story-review-ron-howard"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;were being released. Now, there’s a TV show instead. It’s a smart move for Disney and Lucasfilm. A series is less of a risk than a movie, and it helps keep customers subscribed to the platform. Plus, tying everything together is a pretty good way to get people to stay on Disney Plus to watch other shows when they’re done with the most recent &lt;em&gt;Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;episode; it’s already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21761493/mandalorian-star-wars-clone-rebels-dave-filoni-ahsoka-tano-thrawn"&gt;happening with &lt;em&gt;Clone Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftZeup"&gt;While this season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian &lt;/em&gt;is over, it’s clear that fans have a ton of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; to look forward to in 2021. Can there be too much &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;? Former CEO Bob Iger certainly thought &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; fatigue &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/09/disney-ceo-bob-iger-star-wars-solo-flop-1202175861/"&gt;took over at the box office&lt;/a&gt;, but maybe Disney Plus is a different story. &lt;/p&gt;
