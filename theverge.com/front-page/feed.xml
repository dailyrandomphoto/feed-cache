    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A new class of creators is using OSINT techniques to solve online mysteries&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="J0o9gb"&gt;In October, a TikTok user named Matthew Heller posted a video recorded moments after a small traffic accident at a Florida intersection. In the video, a woman named Maddy Gilsoul comes up to the window of Heller’s car and starts screaming at him. Heller captioned the video, “I got hit from behind. My car was hit from behind while I was stopped. #lamborghini #aventador #hornblasters.” The original video has since been deleted from TikTok, but Heller left a version of it up &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/tv/CUnGM4gKjwd/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;on his Instagram&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnpyQa"&gt;In a world without TikTok, the incident would have remained a small but contentious traffic accident, the fault of which would have been determined by insurance companies. Instead, thousands of users on the shortform video app argued about who was to blame. Was it Gilsoul, who, according to Heller’s video, seemed to have clearly clipped the back of Heller’s Lamborghini? Or was Heller at fault? At one point in the “news cycle,” TikTok users accused him of “gaslighting” them, after new footage surfaced from a nearby security camera that seemed to show him hitting Gilsoul first. Or was this incident even real? Heller appeared to be the founder of a company called &lt;a href="https://hornblasters.com/"&gt;HornBlasters&lt;/a&gt;, which sells custom car horns. A car horn salesman suddenly finds himself at the center of a viral traffic accident? It all seemed too perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hVgKrx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Young users pore over random trending videos, constructing elaborate conspiracy theories&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GolGwj"&gt;As the numbers on Heller’s video began to climb into the millions, TikTok’s army of commentators rushed into the trending topic to debate and analyze what was happening. A TikToker named @ugolord, who calls himself “The TikTok Attorney,” &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ugolord/video/7016060242303683846"&gt;asked his followers&lt;/a&gt; to watch the footage of the accident and decide who was liable. A user named @pushpeksidhu from Toronto &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pushpeksidhu/video/7015995807971216646"&gt;posted an update&lt;/a&gt; on the accident that was watched half a million times, sharing footage from Gilsoul’s account that users hadn’t seen yet, seemingly proving Heller was at fault. A user who goes by @doctor.ryan &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@doctor.ryan/video/7015897477412932869"&gt;made another video&lt;/a&gt; combining Heller’s account with the new security camera footage for a definitive look at the whole scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVwV21"&gt;Drama-reaction accounts like these are riding a huge wave of popularity right now, thanks to an obsession within the TikTok community with investigating, analyzing, and passing judgment on the content going viral on the platform. The app’s young users pore over random trending videos, constructing elaborate conspiracy theories and even doxxing the people featured in them. Most often, these campaigns to unmask other users are driven by some sense of justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXza9S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A teenage version of the OSINT community&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E2OBdG"&gt;In each of these instances, the app’s aggressive recommendation algorithm awakens, pushing the controversies to millions of users, generating hundreds of videos, thousands of comments, and too many views to count. The app has become home to a teenage version of the OSINT (or “open source intelligence”) community, made famous by outlets like the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFR Lab) or investigative site &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5U2ANw"&gt;The biggest account weighing in on the “Lambo crash” trending topic was @TizzyEnt, an account with 3.8 million followers run by a film director named Michael Mc. During the course of the Lamborghini content cycle, Mc posted several updates, at one point even &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/foryou?is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;item_id=7016417722649087238&amp;amp;lang=en#/@tizzyent/video/7016417722649087238"&gt;connecting with Heller&lt;/a&gt; and sharing additional details about what happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGwPt"&gt;If you’re on TikTok, you’ve no doubt seen Mc’s videos. On an app defined by permanently teenage Hype House dancers, Mc’s graying beard and low baritone voice definitely stand out, as does his presentation style. He specializes in what right-wingers might call “cancel culture” or what mainstream journalists might call “internet drama.” He’s part of a network of popular TikTok users who have risen to prominence thanks to the TikTok community’s current fixation on crowdsourced investigations into matters both real and conspiratorial or imaginary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37RuA5"&gt;Mc and his collaborators unmask racists, report anti-vax nurses to their respective hospitals, and help “cancel” members of TikTok’s rogues’ gallery of conspiracy theory truthers, fascists, and viral main characters. But with a massive young audience hungry for accountability, or more accurately, viral justice, these TikTokers are finding there is a fine line between citizen journalism and vigilante information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ytL7hz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, dueting videos with each other&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7gi4ow"&gt;In the case of the Lamborghini saga, TikTok users drew lines and took the side of either Heller or Gilsoul, flooding their accounts with nasty comments. Heller’s TikTok account is no longer active and Gilsoul hasn’t posted since October. But this kind of work can get much more intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbyC9Y"&gt;Shortly before Mc waded into the Lamborghini drama, he &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011258812845788421?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;led a campaign&lt;/a&gt; against a FedEx delivery driver named Vincent Paterno, who claimed in a TikTok video that he would not deliver packages to any homes without an American flag or with a Biden/Harris sign in the front yard. Mc posted Paterno’s Facebook page on TikTok and said he would be reporting him to FedEx. Then Mc and Paterno spent days locked in a feud, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7011657306534399237?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;dueting&lt;/a&gt; videos with each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OS3Ddk"&gt;“You’re such a piece of shit,” Mc says in one video. “Do you know your wife messaged me to tell me how she and her children do not agree with you? How she begged you not to post this? And now you’ve posted a second time — and she’s getting threats, by the way.” Then Mc scolds his own audience for sending threats to Paterno and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UomuRL"&gt;The whole episode ended with Paterno &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;reportedly getting fired&lt;/a&gt; from FedEx. In a final update, Mc &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tizzyent/video/7012747260199030021?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;jokingly threatens&lt;/a&gt; to brand “@tizzyent” on Paterno’s back. This kind of content is far from anything you’re going to get on a mainstream media outlet — maybe on Substack — but Mc’s audience can’t get enough of it, flooding his comment section with tips for more video investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WB5c8y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I look at the internet like one giant small town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dmeCOI"&gt;Mc told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s trying to bring some accountability back to how people behave on the internet. He isn’t actively trying to get people fired — though he does, and isn’t quiet about it on his account when it happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="37bSqx"&gt;“There’s an old expression that ‘bad gas travels fast in a small town.’ If you live in a small town and you do something terrible, everyone knows about it,” he said. “I look at the internet like one giant small town in the sense of: If I put something out there, my objective is not to get someone fired unless their job is directly harming people. So like a nurse refusing to get vaccinated. She could be infecting people. That’s a thing. Or a police officer harming people. That’s the thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlgQEo"&gt;According to Mc, he started out making videos just trying to debunk misinformation and conspiracy theories that came across his For You page, the central feed where TikTok users see content recommended to them. He said earlier this year, as America began its vaccine rollout, the app became inundated with anti-vax content. In August, a user sent him a video of a woman who went by @antivaxmomma, who was bragging about selling fake vaccination cards on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9MBP5"&gt;“[Users] find someone doing that sort of thing, and they don’t know how to deal with it themselves,” he said. “They reach out to people like me, and go, ‘Hey, can you see what this person is doing? Can you help with this kind of thing?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="DGrnHl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JpaGAx"&gt;Mc and the network of other TikTokers he works with sprang into action, identifying the woman as Jasmine Clifford, who &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-c14ce28edda2593b0b3819acec97089e"&gt;was then charged&lt;/a&gt; by law enforcement with conspiracy, and offering and possession of a forged instrument. According to Mc, his regular collaborators include &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/online-sleuth-danesh-thatdaneshguy-tiktok-anti-vaxxers"&gt;@ThatDaneshGuy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/irl/aunt-karen-white-lives-matter-facebook/"&gt;@auntkaren0&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/she-called-out-health-care-misinfo-tiktok-then-trolls-found-n1265011"&gt;@rx0rcist&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom who have made headlines in the last few months for their flashy videos exposing and publicly shaming various villains within the progressive-leaning world of TikTok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGElj9"&gt;There is a feeling, one Mc shares, among many long-time TikTok users that individual accounts have to step up and personally deal with the app’s rampant misinformation, extremism, and conspiracy theories. As Mc sees it, his account wouldn’t need to exist if TikTok actually moderated its platform properly. “The algorithm kind of promotes tribalism,” he said. “You get inside of the bubble when you start believing that your perspective is the only one that matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3NYy0o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qXjSvG"&gt;But the videos these users post are a tightrope walk of investigative journalism, punditry, and open source intelligence that could easily fall into the same trap as Reddit’s libelous and disastrous &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-22263020"&gt;r/FindTheBostonBomber experiment&lt;/a&gt;. But according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/etbrooking"&gt;Emerson T. Brooking&lt;/a&gt;, a resident senior fellow at the DFR Lab, we are well past the point where journalistic institutions can decide who can and cannot conduct OSINT research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDHm0A"&gt;“I’m not gonna position myself as a legacy gatekeeper; I think something fundamentally changed in this work about 10 years ago,” he told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You need to use communities and enthusiasm to try to accomplish some good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdSYq9"&gt;Brooking clarified, though, that performing this kind of work out in the open — or at least on an app like TikTok, which has a trending topic-focused algorithm that blurs together responsible TikTokers like Mc and more rogue accounts that are doing it for clout — could easily spin out of control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2CyNG"&gt;“If you look into how &lt;em&gt;Bellingcat&lt;/em&gt; is structured,” Brooking said, “whether their most famous, prominent analysts have this public presence, they’re doing their work on a Slack channel, actually. They’re not doing every bit of it on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsuWOL"&gt;Making things even more confusing is when large media organizations begin to weigh in on these fairly low-level TikTok dramas. Being the subject of a TikTok spat is one thing, but it’s another to elevate it into a news story and turn a local incident into international headlines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xsd9J3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qseBdn"&gt;Both Mc and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sophiasgaler"&gt;Sophia Smith Galer&lt;/a&gt;, a London-based senior news reporter for &lt;em&gt;VICE &lt;/em&gt;who also runs a personal TikTok account with over 275,000 followers, said traditional media has a habit of turning the volume up on these minor naming-and-shaming campaigns happening on TikTok. Smith Galer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the media often legitimizes the vigilante justice being carried out by random TikTok users when they turn these viral scandals into news stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWc3fv"&gt;“We saw this with the rush to cover TikTok users investigating the disappearance of Gabby Petito, or the reporting around TikTok users erroneously claiming that a furniture company was somehow trafficking children during the US presidential election,” she said. “TikTok users overanalyzing videos going viral on the app is nothing new.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYWfFC"&gt;During Mc’s crusade against Paterno, the FedEx driver, the two men traded barbs across their social media platforms and Mc did share Paterno’s Facebook information and reported Paterno to FedEx. But the ensuing media swarm, kicked off by &lt;a href="https://toofab.com/2021/09/24/fedex-fires-driver-who-refused-to-deliver-to-homes-with-biden-or-camel-toe-harris-flags/"&gt;this article from &lt;em&gt;TooFab&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, brought the story to a national stage, eventually getting coverage &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/09/27/fedex-driver-fired-after-not-delivering-to-biden-supporters/"&gt;in the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Paterno is still on TikTok, by the way, where he’s now &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vincentmrworldwid/video/7029130139740982574?is_copy_url=1&amp;amp;is_from_webapp=v1&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;posting anti-vax content&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YL0WG7"&gt;But according to Smith Galer, when mainstream media outlets cover these stories, the more responsible users like Mc, the genuinely nefarious bad actors spreading disinformation, and just the random shitposters get swirled together into a trend that typically makes the chaos on TikTok worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJHFTT"&gt;Like Brooking, Smith Galer sees the current wave of amateur OSINT happening on TikTok as a net positive, but also a recipe for chaos. There &lt;a href="https://wallaroomedia.com/blog/social-media/tiktok-statistics/#:~:text=U.S.%20Audience%20%E2%80%93%20As%20we%20mentioned,between%20the%20ages%2025%2D44."&gt;are currently&lt;/a&gt; around 80 million active users on TikTok in America, but &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095186/tiktok-us-users-age/"&gt;Statista estimates&lt;/a&gt; that roughly a quarter of those users are between ages 10-19. That is a lot of children learning how to doxx each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RewUGY"&gt;“What’s fun about all of these is how they are universalizing OSINT skills, but what is not fun about all of these is the lack of media literacy and the innocence in which content creators commit contempt of court, libel, or spread harmful misinformation,” Smith Galer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPVAGt"&gt;And this is the central dynamic Mc said he’s been struggling with recently. He said he was committed to using his TikTok account to exposing various bad actors, but he has noticed that, regardless of how even-keeled his presentation style is, his followers — or users who find his videos in their For You pages — aren’t as interested in making sure things are done the right way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tvlBc1"&gt;“I think I’m gonna have to start saying in every video, ‘Hey, don’t, don’t threaten them. No death threats, no violence.’ If you want to write to someone’s employer and say you don’t like what that employee did, that’s your prerogative to do that. But no, you calling an oncology department and saying, ‘I’ll kill all of you’ — I don’t believe that my followers did that,” he said. “But I’m still going to put it out there just in case any of my followers get really upset about something or someone who sees one of my videos.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Should abuse survivors have to disappear from the internet?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0HuuxyN84x0LuXc6WEvcb0BFtkM=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70234086/VRG_Illo_4902_Security_Abuse.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Ori Toor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some survivors are challenging the conventional wisdom about how to stay safe online&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="GIVsoL"&gt;For more than two decades, Lorraine* has known her ex-boyfriend is watching her. She cut contact with him 20 years ago, but in Facebook posts and intimidating emails, he makes sure she knows he’s still keeping tabs, from the birth of her children to her most recent wedding anniversary. After years of abuse that resulted in a PTSD diagnosis and intense nightmares, the notes are chilling, and make her uncomfortable putting any personal information in an online space where he could see it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83wubm"&gt;“It’s affected my relationship with my friends,” Lorraine says. “It’s affected my relationship with my partner. It’s affected my ability to feel safe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D86rJm"&gt;The advice many survivors like Lorraine receive when they look for help is to leave their online life behind and delete themselves from the internet entirely. There are many tutorials on how to delete your online presence. Given how often abusers use digital channels to harass their targets, erasing yourself can seem like the obvious choice. But interpersonal abuse thrives on the alienation of its victims, and some kind of online presence can be a crucial lifeline for people trying to escape their abusers and rebuild a new life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y52Qp0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SvgytB"&gt;Tony Hunt, chief development officer of Operation Safe Escape, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of domestic violence escape their abusers, says deleting yourself from the internet could be exactly what the stalker wants. “It’s about control, they want to isolate you because that gives them absolute control over everything you do,” Hunt explained. “It’s easy to think you need to disappear, but you don’t need to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="py1LZT"&gt;It’s an urgent question for thousands of people quietly struggling with domestic violence. One in four women and one in nine men will experience severe intimate partner physical violence at some point in their lives, &lt;a href="https://ncadv.org/statistics"&gt;according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence&lt;/a&gt;. One in seven women and one in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime, to a point where they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed. &lt;a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0886260515614283"&gt;A 2015 survey&lt;/a&gt; of college students found that nearly 75 percent had experienced some kind of tech-assisted intimate partner victimization in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkrBI2"&gt;For Lorraine, deleting herself from the internet didn’t feel like a solution. “It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse,” she said. “Both my husband and I have worked in various countries, so social media is brilliant for keeping in contact with people that we rarely see. We wouldn’t want to lose that ability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lcQrLi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It felt like I was removing my online liberty because of someone else’s abuse.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b9nglq"&gt;Julia’s* ex-partner surveilled her even when they were together and continued to do so after they had broken up, which made online spaces particularly dangerous. But instead of retreating, the threat inspired her to learn more about internet security, and to be more careful with how and where she logged on. For her, &lt;a href="https://goaskrose.com/guide-secure-comms/"&gt;establishing safe communications with trusted people&lt;/a&gt; was particularly essential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Hai0I"&gt;“An abusive relationship is already devastating, and shrinking afterwards adds to the devastation,” Julia said. “We can develop intentional boundaries on the internet, it doesn’t have to be all or nothing. It was better for me to learn more about internet security, privacy, and different tools stalkers can use than retreating, because that knowledge empowered me to have a more realistic sense of what is possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKlBQ8"&gt;Some survivors also worry that disappearing entirely will escalate the situation, according to University of Kentucky professor &lt;a href="https://behavioralscience.med.uky.edu/users/tklogan#profileTab4"&gt;TK Logan&lt;/a&gt;, who researches cyberstalking. “I’ve had victims say, he was threatening me and doing all this stuff through social media so I got off social media,” she explained. “And now all the survivor can think about is, ‘Oh, my God, what is he doing? Is he just going to show up physically?’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bpPHgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="07EE2c"&gt;Hunt frames the security measures survivors should employ as a new kind of lifestyle where survivors are intentional about their online presence, rather than a disappearing act. “The priority is making sure that nobody’s advertising everything about their personal lives,” he said. “Because [the abuser] will have something that will give them access to the kids or their location or their regimen throughout the day. Once you’ve established those boundaries and you start living your life again, you’ll be glad you did it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJyl6K"&gt;Though Operation Safe Escape trains survivors on more general security protocols rather than only focusing on online security, Hunt says technology-facilitated abuse comes up often. Part of the organization’s job, in partnership with the Coalition Against Stalkerware, is to identify developers that claim their software is for law enforcement, but actually sell their products to individuals looking to coerce and control their victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVsO6Q"&gt;“What happens is, you have boyfriends who will pay contractors to install a keylogger on their girlfriend’s computer, and all of a sudden, a whole new world opens up,” Hunt said. “If the abuser has the right tools and he has physical access to the device, in 30 to 60 seconds there’s a lot he can do.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFBWbV"&gt;With regard to these higher-level security threats that include hacking and surveillance, Hunt recommends survivors get directly in contact with &lt;a href="https://safeescape.org/help/"&gt;Operation Safe Escape&lt;/a&gt; so they can be guided on what options they have to leave safely and regain their life and autonomy. “We are really selective about who we work with and how much information we put out there,” Hunt explained. “Once that information is out there, guess who tries to use it against survivors?” Logan also recommends setting up multiple-factor authentication, and directs survivors to the &lt;a href="https://ukcdar.uky.edu/cdarlime25/index.php/survey/index/sid/57925/newtest/Y/lang/en"&gt;Stalking and Harassment Assessment &amp;amp; Risk Profile (SHARP) tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JfXDe"&gt;The most reliable way to detect stalkerware on an Android device is to run an antivirus app and do a scan. For iOS users, Apple provides a &lt;a href="https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/1000/MA1976/en_US/device-and-data-access-when-personal-safety-is-at-risk.pdf"&gt;step-by-step&lt;/a&gt; guide for detecting invasive apps. The &lt;a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/"&gt;Coalition Against Stalkerware also recommends&lt;/a&gt; that potential victims keep a log of what they are experiencing, to help detect patterns and show the history of what has been happening if they choose to get help from law enforcement or a survivor assistance charity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQDHHb"&gt;But even given the threat of malicious software, the most effective protections still rely on a strong support network, which is much easier to build when you’re connected. “The goal is to put up as many barriers, make it as difficult as possible for the stalker,” says Logan, “and then the other step is to get support.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5Zuaw"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Some names have been changed to protect sources who have been targeted by abuse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple is fighting Russian regulator’s demands on alternative app payments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SUUtKRbOpZjwnXWJ2gxbQ8gU0X4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233966/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IUbSSC"&gt;Apple is challenging antitrust action taken by Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which wants iOS developers to be able to tell customers about alternatives to Apple’s in-app payment option, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-starts-legal-action-against-russian-regulator-app-store-dispute-ria-2021-12-06/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Apple wants a judicial review of the regulator’s warning, &lt;a href="https://www.rt.com/business/542257-apple-takes-russia-court/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Russia Today&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, which was originally issued with a &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/438557-fas-predupredila-apple-iz-za-zapreta-soobsat-o-vozmoznosti-oplaty-vne-app-store"&gt;deadline of September 30th&lt;/a&gt; for the US tech giant to change its anti-steering policies. When Apple didn’t comply, FAS announced it was opening an antitrust case against the company &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/russia-opens-case-against-apple-over-app-store-payment-restrictions-2021-10-27/"&gt;at the end of October&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgnoWb"&gt;The US tech giant’s policies on in-app payments are contentious, to say the very least. Apple requires iOS developers to use its own in-app payment system, which in many cases allows it to collect up to a lucrative 30 percent commission on any purchases. Not only does Apple ban developers from allowing third-party payment methods in their apps, it even limits their ability to tell customers when they accept alternative payment methods elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zkRd5p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;FAS is accusing Apple of “abusing its dominant position”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="50iGGg"&gt;It’s this policy that FAS is specifically objecting to. In an announcement at the &lt;a href="http://en.fas.gov.ru/press-center/news/detail.html?id=55296"&gt;end of October&lt;/a&gt;, the regulator said Apple was “abusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of apps through its App Store” by not allowing developers to tell “in-app users about the possibility [of paying] for their purchases outside the App Store.” Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PuC9iZ"&gt;In August, in response to a class-action lawsuit, Apple said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;“clarifying” its policies&lt;/a&gt; about developers telling customers about alternative payment methods. It said that developers could use communications like emails to share information with customers about alternative payment methods. However, it stopped short of letting developers do this inside apps themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ntm1kO"&gt;Apple’s App Store policies are facing pushback around the world. In the US, the judge in Apple’s legal battle with Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22662320/epic-apple-ruling-injunction-judge-court-app-store"&gt;ordered the company to allow iOS apps&lt;/a&gt; to direct users to alternative payment options, and gave the company a deadline of December 9th to comply. Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;lawmakers in South Korea passed a bill&lt;/a&gt; in late August banning platform holders like Google and Apple from limiting developers to using their first-party payment systems. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22407376/apple-european-union-antitrust-charges-app-store-music-competition-commission-margrethe-vestager"&gt;European Commission has also issued antitrust charges&lt;/a&gt; over the practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlpKbz"&gt;Russia’s antitrust authority has already clashed with Apple this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407293/apple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app"&gt;fining the tech giant $12 million&lt;/a&gt; over complaints it unfairly cracked down on third-party parental control apps. With its latest legal action, FAS is tapping into a far more contentious policy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Duolingo interprets 2021, with TikTok and Squid Game inspiring users to learn new languages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSZHj4tzG1JnmivcQqed7csWGVo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70233479/acastro_20200723_1777_duolingo_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V4N1Cu"&gt;Language learning app Duolingo said its phrase of the year is “I am mentally exhausted,” which appears as part of its Japanese course and does seem to nicely sum up 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y5QWo"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811900/spotify-wrapped-2021-music-recap-iphone-android"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812079/apple-music-year-in-review-spotify-wrapped-social-media"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo is giving users a look back at the year that was. Starting today, anyone who completed at least 10 Duolingo lessons in 2021 can get a personalized look at what kind of language learner they are, based on when they practice their lessons, how many courses they’ve taken, and how many hours they spent learning on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2mhVkQ2wtenSakDPmW3MEd6ns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063133/duolingo_yir_learnerstylereviel.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Duolingo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Duolingo’s Year in Review will tell you want kind of language learner you were in 2021.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="joExSM"&gt;In its 2021 &lt;a href="https://blog.duolingo.com/2021-duolingo-language-report/"&gt;language report&lt;/a&gt;, Duolingo said the top five languages learned on the app this year were Spanish, English, French, Japanese, and German, with Korean rising in popularity worldwide. Among those who started a new language on Duolingo during the pandemic, 80 percent used the mobile app to conduct lessons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFWk73"&gt;More than two-thirds of users Duolingo surveyed said a “cultural event” might inspire them to try to pick up a new language, with 29 percent saying TikTok videos in other languages served as motivation That number was even higher among Gen Z users, at 40 percent. Among those who were inspired by a streaming show to learn a new language, 37 percent started lessons in Spanish after watching &lt;em&gt;Money Heist; &lt;/em&gt;28 percent decided to learn Korean after watching &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, and 20 percent took up French after watching &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrGv28"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/language-learning-app-duolingo-pops-35percent-in-public-debut-on-the-nasdaq.html"&gt;Pittsburgh-based company, which went public in July&lt;/a&gt;, had a busy 2021. In May, founder and CEO Luis von Ahn, a native of Guatemala, joined Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/civil-rights-social-justice/duolingo-founder-a-pittsburgher-and-immigrant-puts-his-app-to-work-fighting-illiteracy-in-central-america/"&gt;push for businesses&lt;/a&gt; to invest in Central America. The app also&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362723/duolingo-yiddish-language-classes"&gt; added its 40th language, Yiddish&lt;/a&gt;, in April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A humanoid robot makes eerily lifelike facial expressions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xtkc7nfCk1gCHrJ5Wh8I2lKA2IY=/399x0:2381x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232539/humanoid_robot_facial_expression.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Engineered Arts via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPukuYb9xWw" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gy5qdC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/"&gt;Engineered Arts&lt;/a&gt;, a UK-based designer and manufacturer of humanoid robots, recently showed off one of its most lifelike creations in a video posted on YouTube. The robot, called &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/ameca/"&gt;Ameca&lt;/a&gt;, is shown making a series of incredibly human-like facial expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="N3ekFG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ameca opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RP8LbE"&gt;At the start of the video, Ameca appears to “wake up,” as its face conveys a mix of confusion and frustration when it opens its eyes. But when Ameca starts looking at its hands and arms, the robot opens its mouth and raises its brows in what it looks like is amazement. The end of the video shows Ameca smiling and holding a welcoming hand out towards the viewer — if that’s how you want to interpret that gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEUbI5"&gt;Sorry to disappoint, but Ameca doesn’t walk, flip, or do parkour like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Atlas robot does&lt;/a&gt;. That said, we likely won’t see Ameca walking and talking among us anytime soon. Engineered Arts says the bot is currently unable to walk, although it wants to give it that ability at some point. As for whether Ameca operates using AI, Engineered Arts explains that it leaves AI capabilities up to developers — it just handles the ultra-realistic bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Lmwh1s"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTny-MYb4tE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xJvjka"&gt;If Ameca doesn’t creep you out enough, Engineered Arts also developed another realistic bot, named &lt;a href="https://www.engineeredarts.co.uk/robot/mesmer/"&gt;Mesmer&lt;/a&gt;. The company says that it used 3D scans of actual humans to give the bot accurate bone structure, skin texture, and lifelike facial expressions. In a video posted just days after the Ameca showcase, Mesmer makes a series of expressions that looks even more convincing, given that this bot has more lifelike skin and facial features than Ameca does at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n8NESR"&gt;Since Engineered Arts focuses on creating humanoid robots for entertainment, Ameca and Mesmer will likely be the center of attention at venues and events, rather than robots designed to do a specific job or take over all of humanity. If you want to see Ameca in real life, Engineered Arts says it’ll be on display at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628787/ces-2022-covid-19-vaccine-proof-cta"&gt;CES 2022 in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clearview AI is closer to getting a US patent for its facial recognition technology</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNVLdCyF7o8CbXOveUXadxcYvYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70232333/acastro_210512_1777_deepfake_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8DEjBy"&gt;Clearview AI is on track to receive a US patent for its facial recognition technology, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/04/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-523735"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company was reportedly sent a “notice of allowance” by the US Patent and Trademark Office, which means that once it pays the required administration fees, its patent will be officially approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBbFf6"&gt;Clearview AI builds its facial recognition database using images of people that it scrapes across social media (and the internet in general), a practice that has the company steeped in controversy. The company’s &lt;a href="https://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;amp;d=PG01&amp;amp;f=G&amp;amp;l=50&amp;amp;p=1&amp;amp;r=1&amp;amp;s1=20210042527.PGNR.&amp;amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html"&gt;patent application&lt;/a&gt; details its use of a “web crawler” to acquire images, even noting that “online photos associated with a person’s account may help to create additional records of facial recognition data points,” which its machine learning algorithm can then use to find and identify matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CisU2U"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OcnlGq"&gt;Critics argue that Clearview AI’s facial recognition technology is a violation of privacy and that it may negatively impact minority communities. The technology is allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/2/11/21131991/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-database-law-enforcement"&gt;less accurate when identifying people of color and women&lt;/a&gt;, potentially leading to false arrests when used by law enforcement agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNfIc6"&gt;Last year, the company said that its technology was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21402978/clearview-ai-ceo-interview-2400-police-agencies-facial-recognition"&gt;used by over 2,400 police agencies&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;including the FBI and Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt; — to identify suspects. In the aftermath of the Capitol riots this January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223349/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-law-enforcement-capitol-rioters"&gt;Clearview AI said the use of its technology by law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; sharply increased as detectives worked to identify those associated with the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6h4Rt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273388/aclu-clearview-ai-lawsuit-facial-recognition-database-illinois-biometric-laws"&gt;American Civil Liberties Union sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last year for violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, resulting in Clearview &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21251387/clearview-ai-law-enforcement-police-facial-recognition-illinois-privacy-law"&gt;stopping the sale of its technology to private companies&lt;/a&gt; and non-law enforcement entities. In November, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761001/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-australia-breach-data-delete"&gt;Australian government ordered the company&lt;/a&gt; to clear its database of all its citizens, and earlier this year, a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455446/clearview-ai-legal-privacy-complaint-privacy-international-facial-recognition-eu"&gt;European agencies filed legal complaints&lt;/a&gt; against Clearview AI. In addition, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266055/clearview-facial-recognition-illegal-mass-surveillance-canada-privacy"&gt;Canadian privacy commissioner called the company’s technology&lt;/a&gt; “illegal mass surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUmOgV"&gt;Clearview AI hasn’t even been able to get on Big Tech’s good side. Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126063/facebook-clearview-ai-image-scraping-facial-recognition-database-terms-of-service-twitter-youtube"&gt;Facebook, LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/technology/clearview-ai-twitter-letter.html"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124172/youtube-clearview-ai-cease-and-desist"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; all sent cease and desist letters demanding that the company stop scraping images and videos from the platforms, as the practice is in violation of each site’s policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0QMR5m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is there any way out of Clearview’s facial recognition database?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22522486/clearview-ai-facial-recognition-avoid-escape-privacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEHRxJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 5th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per &lt;/em&gt;IGN’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TayNixster/status/1467245203283140617"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and an updated message on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart Gamer Drop splash page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the event won’t have the new consoles you’re probably looking for, despite featuring them prominently in the artwork. The post below has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8XU9j"&gt;Walmart has announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop event&lt;/a&gt; coming to select stores on December 11th, where the retailer is promising to have the “latest gaming titles and consoles.” It’s billing it as a holiday shopping event, complete with discounts and exclusive gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prXoF1"&gt; &lt;a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-4866/k2-_331621d6-7642-4095-82d1-ecac1d3f3bc9.v1.pdf"&gt;The posted circular on Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt; prominently features the major consoles, including the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, Xbox Series X / S, and both models of the PlayStation 5 with the note of “Available in-store or online at &lt;a href="http://Walmart.com/GamerDrop"&gt;Walmart.com/GamerDrop.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBT87C"&gt;After the event was announced, Walmart added more text to the notice (you can see the original one in the image below), informing gamers that “PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch OLED will not be available during this event.” It’s unclear whether or not they will have any Xbox Series X consoles on hand, but if there are, then the notice says you will only be able to purchase them as part of an All Access subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jolFad"&gt;This event is exclusive to select Walmart stores. You can find the closest Walmart that’s participating in the Gamer Drop event on Saturday, the 11th, by searching your address or zip code on the &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop&lt;/a&gt; page. Listed stores indicate Gamer Drop hours of 10:30AM to 7PM, which is a limited window compared to store hours of many Walmart stores. We have reached out to Walmart for further details and will keep an eye out for more information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verizon app might be collecting your browsing history and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTuYkY79miGTm3dxd_vXfaWPL7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231632/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0UWrO"&gt;The My Verizon app might be collecting information about your browsing history, location, apps, and your contacts, all in the name of helping the company “understand your interests,” first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/verizon-customers-might-want-to-check-their-privacy-settings-asap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program, which Verizon appears to automatically opt customers into, is called Verizon Custom Experience and lays buried in the privacy settings on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEtwFY"&gt;The program introduces two different options that appear in the app, Custom Experience and Custom Experience Plus, each of which varies in terms of invasiveness. Verizon provides additional information about both settings within the app, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; on its website. It appears that the Custom Experience option is a stripped-down version of Custom Experience Plus, and as Verizon states directly in the app, it helps Verizon “personalize” its “communication with you” and “give you more relevant product and service recommendations” by using “information about websites you visit and apps you use on your mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUQBfA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Verizon's "Custom Experience" and "Custom Experience Plus" settings appear to let the company collect your device location, phone numbers you call, and your browsing history. Via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inputmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inputmag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv"&gt;https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/M4CHchHmZi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M4CHchHmZi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emma Roth (@emroth08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emroth08/status/1467549460075094023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksz12I"&gt;Meanwhile, Custom Experience Plus has the same purpose — to help Verizon provide you with a more “personalized” experience. However, it not only uses information about the websites and apps you use on your mobile device, but it also says it uses your “device location,” along with “phone numbers you call or that call you” to help Verizon “better understand your interests.” This also includes your CPNI, which tracks the times and duration of your calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4sKvUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8S3iG"&gt;As Verizon explains on its site, it might use your information to, say, present you with an offer that includes music content, or give you a music-related option in its Verizon Up reward program if it knows you like music. Verizon explicitly states that you “must opt in to participate and you can change your choice at any time,” but it doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in themselves, or perhaps they’re doing so unknowingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ToCtG"&gt;After checking the privacy settings on my own app, I found that “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus” were both already toggled on. I don’t recall ever turning either of these features on, or being asked about it. As Andrew Paul of &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt; notes, he only discovered the feature after mistakenly opening a promotional email from Verizon that describes the new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xx4PS9"&gt;To opt-out of the Custom Experience altogether, open your My Verizon app, and then hit the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Scroll down and select “Manage privacy settings” beneath the “Preferences” heading. On the next page, toggle off “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus.” To erase the information that Verizon has already collected about you through the program, tap “Custom Experience Settings,” and hit “Reset.” The company says that it won’t sell your information to advertisers and that it will “use it only for Verizon purposes,” but it’s still unnerving either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV3HkK"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers"&gt;T-Mobile started automatically enrolling users&lt;/a&gt; in a program that shares your data with advertisers unless you manually opt-out from your &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F5%2F22818783%2Fverizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/full_privacy_policy.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s privacy center&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that it collects web and browsing information, along with the apps you use, and that you can manage these settings from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/rights_choices.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Station Eleven, The Matrix Resurrections, The Book of Boba Fett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8egd3nYkAzv2HWHDWnLYtryjwo=/284x0:1592x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231469/mackenzie_davis_station_eleven_two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mackenzie Davis stars in Station Eleven | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaAG-SwEa7k&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6lf8U"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, and even though it meandered a lot, I found myself wanting more. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’&lt;/em&gt;s Jason Gay &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-miss-my-new-best-friends-the-beatles-11638543379?st=0mjtpkgws5h1pit&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;nicely captures what it felt like&lt;/a&gt; to watch this 50-year old footage as a fan, like we were all kinda just hanging out with John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they worked on new material. Highly recommend watching, it will make you question some of the prevailing narratives about the Fab Four (like the widely held belief that they were at each other’s throats constantly as the band neared its breakup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk8hn5"&gt;Also! We got some late-breaking news Saturday about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:  Into the Spider-Verse. &lt;/em&gt;It’s going to be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will actually be a two-parter, with part one to be released October 2022, and part two following in 2023. Hit that link for the first trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2xh02y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C8pqve"&gt;The rest of this week’s trailers include a new peeks at a few movies and shows we’ve seen previous trailers and teasers for, and a (fictional) new HBO Max series about people living in a post-pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6EoPs9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaAG-SwEa7k?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JAa7dl"&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TDk3sf"&gt;Based on the Emily St. John Mandel novel, &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the aftermath of a pandemic whose production was delayed by the real-world pandemic. Twenty years after most of the population was wiped out by the Georgia flu, a band of performers travels the post-apocalyptic landscape staging performances and encountering all manner of survivors including a mysterious person known as The Prophet. (One glimpse of a “museum of civilization” shows a display of some 21st-century relics including “the internet”, a “Switch, Nintendo,” and a “car key fob”). We see both the Before and After Times mainly through the eyes of Kristen, who was a child actress at the onset of the flu and is played by Mackenzie Davis as an adult. Himesh Patel, David Wilmot, Nabhaan Rizwan, Daniel Zovatto, Lori Petty and Matilda Lawler star in &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt;, which begins its 10-episode run December 16th on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tkKri9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgYs_NDyaLs?rel=0&amp;amp;start=60" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uuJiQz"&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l8BVVu"&gt;I did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; review/appreciation for this trailer the day it came out and have watched it a few (OK many) times since. We don’t get a lot more insight into the movie’s plot here, except that a main element will be “change.” We do hear a voiceover mention that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,” and I hope the movie rolls with this idea! Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christina Ricci, and Jada Pinkett Smith star in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters and HBO Max December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TtNOOi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCAlNWNbN5c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="57TlAX"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X4KDVW"&gt;“I am Boba Fett, left for dead on the sands of Tatooine” this new teaser begins. We see our protagonist submerged in what looks like a &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacta_tank"&gt;Bacta tank&lt;/a&gt; with a breathing apparatus attached to his face, likely explaining what happened to him post-Sarlacc ingestion in &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; (but not how he actually got out). A few characters look surprised to see Boba in this (very brief) new teaser titled “Message.” Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen star in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BS5ly"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHXq62VCaCM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XEW1qb"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XNt4ox"&gt;We got a teaser in October, and now we have a full trailer for the eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series. John Cena reprises his role from James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;(Gunn also created the &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series and wrote and directed most of its episodes), but he’s teamed up here with a new bunch of oddballs to try to keep the peace by assassinating people who are supposedly threats to the US. We see in the trailer that despite his bravado Peacemaker seems to question what he’s really doing and why. Along with Cena, Robert Patrick, Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, Steve Agee, Jennifer Holland, and Chukwudi Iwuji star in &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UsXJBB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkV2_4ZsqAQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8aaE7e"&gt;Studio 666&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W8QtU0"&gt;The premise of this horror/comedy flick: The Foo Fighters are recording a new album in a haunted mansion and some evil and bloody hijinks ensue. We don’t get a whole lot of clues about the plot, but we see Dave Grohl get the demon eyes and start levitating, along with glimpses of monsters, an ostensibly evil book, and other supernatural staples of horror flicks. It looks silly and fun as hell. Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett, and Rami Jaffee, along with Whitney Cummings, Leslie Grossman, and Will Forte star in &lt;em&gt;Studio 666&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An interactive Doja Cat music video can introduce you to programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZmcFaepP24sNNY_r1haTHYAxr4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231226/doja_code_woman_music_video.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Doja Cat codable music video. | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dojacode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Girls Who Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4RMua"&gt;Girls Who Code, the nonprofit organization that aims to get more women and girls interested in the field of computer science, has debuted what it calls the “first ever” codable music video. The organization partnered with Doja Cat, transforming her new music video for &lt;em&gt;Woman&lt;/em&gt; into an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fS40l4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HUGE NEWS: We just made the first ever codable music video with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DojaCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dojacat&lt;/a&gt;. You can control the story using code   Go try it now at &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgVStNr5om"&gt;https://t.co/EgVStNr5om&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dojacode?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#dojacode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q2MQhMDd0s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q2MQhMDd0s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Girls Who Code (@GirlsWhoCode) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GirlsWhoCode/status/1466784319846944771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDVREX"&gt;You can try out the experience for yourself at &lt;a href="https://dojacode.com/"&gt;Dojacode.com&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll be greeted by a futuristic image of Doja Cat that becomes pixelated as you drag your mouse over the screen. On the next page, you’ll see three stars, each of which represents a different programming language — yellow for CSS; blue for Javascript; and pink for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg7bkg"&gt;Once you click the music video, the experience begins. It plays just like Doja Cat’s original music video, only you’ll get to make decisions throughout, sort of like a choose your own adventure game, but with code. The timeline on the bottom of the screen contains four color-coded stars, showing when the video will pause and which programming language will be showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnCMJ4PtLW_BR5OKDMkhkLGuLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23064505/doja_code_video_nails.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Emma Roth / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Typing in a color changes the look of Doja Cat’s nails.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrJrz"&gt;When the video stops, you’ll be able to fill in the blanks besides lines of code. For example, the first break lets you change the color of Doja Cat’s nails using CSS; the color you type in alters the color of Doja Cat’s nails in real-time. In another scenario, entering the name of a city changes the time of day in the video, and it even stays true to that location’s current time — after I typed in “Tokyo” at around 10:00AM ET, the sky in the video turned dark and constellations became visible, all in line with Tokyo’s 12:00AM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtHBxF"&gt;At the end of the experience, you’ll get snapshots of how each area looked after you finished “coding” it, which the site then lets you download or share to social media. While the DojaCode video doesn’t involve any intense amounts of programming, I still found it fun to experiment with typing in different options and seeing my changes instantly take effect.&lt;/p&gt;
