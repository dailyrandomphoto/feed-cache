    <title>Tesla’s driving data storage system hacked by Dutch investigators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KViZV9NcMeUgVHgFG-zlOk4GWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027174/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pp2iiW"&gt;A team of Dutch forensic researchers have decrypted Tesla’s data storage system, providing access to a trove of information that could be useful in crash investigations. (The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2tOTV"&gt;It’s no secret that Tesla records information about its customers’ driving behavior, both to improve its advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot, and also in the event of a crash, to provide to investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXcYeU"&gt;But researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.forensischinstituut.nl/actueel/nieuws/2021/10/21/opgeslagen-data-in-autos-bevatten-een-schat-aan-informatie-voor-strafrechtelijke-onderzoeken"&gt;Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) discovered&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s vehicles store far more detailed data than previously known, including speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle, and brake usage. Some of this data can be stored for up to a year, the institute said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AqRfIV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle, and brake usage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgfmhX"&gt;The team was investigating a crash involving a Tesla with Autopilot in use that had rear-ended another vehicle after it braked unexpectedly. Rather than seek the data from Tesla, the Dutch investigators chose to “reverse engineer” the company’s data logs in order to “objectively” assess them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIxi4O"&gt;“These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury,” Francis Hoogendijk, a digital investigator at the NFI, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjCdSa"&gt;The NFI said that even though Tesla has complied with data requests from the government in the past, the company also left out a lot of data that could have proven useful. “Tesla however only supplies a specific subset of signals, only the ones requested, for a specific timeframe, whereas the log files contain all the recorded signals,” the NFI’s report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OQlEMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The news of the hack could have implications for US investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jNlYFS"&gt;The news of the hack could have implications for US investigators who are probing a dozen incidents of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and emergency vehicles while Autopilot is in use. A spokesperson for the National Traffics Highway Safety Administration did not immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4jxAWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Tesla and Waymo are tackling a major problem for self-driving cars: data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/4/19/17204044/tesla-waymo-self-driving-car-data-simulation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pJnDBp"&gt;Tesla encrypts its data to protect it from rival manufacturers. Tesla owners can request their own data from the company, including camera footage, in the event of a crash. Tesla also runs Autopilot in something it calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13341194/tesla-autopilot-shadow-mode-autonomous-regulations"&gt;“shadow mode”&lt;/a&gt; that allows the company to gather statistical data on false positives and false negatives. In shadow mode, the car isn’t taking any action, but it registers when it would have taken action — which allows the company’s engineering team to see if the autonomous mode would have avoided crashes when they take place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGFsiB"&gt;The Dutch team said it was helpful to have a broader scope of data from Tesla’s vehicles, especially as cars become more like other digital products with the ability to log and store important information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hEhSv"&gt;“It would be good if this data would become available more often for forensic investigations,” Hoogendijk said. “Now that we know what kind of data can be obtained from a Tesla, certain data can be requested even more specifically for the purpose of finding the truth after an accident.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SotKOT"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company dissolved its press office and hasn’t responded to media inquiries in over two years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s futuristic Zephyr mask is available today, starting at $99.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LAqlogDyI9dvfzvaA6onGLbVROo=/1x0:4378x2918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027119/zephyrhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zephyr is apparently light enough to accompany you on a jog, assuming you want some extra attention.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pPqGQJ"&gt;Razer’s Zephyr face mask is available to the public after several months of tweaking features and beta testing with Razer super fans. You can purchase it starting tonight at 11PM ET / 8PM PT from &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgear-accessories%2Frazer-zephyr%2Fbuy&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; in two configurations. The most basic kit for $99.99 includes the mask, a carrying tote, a USB-C charging cable, anti-fog spray, and three sets of replaceable N95 filters that will cover you for nine days of use. If you want more filters included with your purchase, a $149.99 version includes everything mentioned above, plus 33 sets of filters for 99 days of filtered use. You can purchase filters by themselves in sets of 10 for $29.99, which will get you 30 days of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhU72f"&gt;The Zephyr is a completely different kind of product for Razer and could be one of its most important yet. The brand is known mostly for its gaming accessories and PC components that serve to entertain, but the Zephyr mask is aimed at keeping people healthier (while no less lit up with RGB LEDs). It made for a slightly perplexing — but nevertheless big — reception for CES 2021 since the company has historically shown off gaming-related concepts like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/6/14196190/razer-project-valerie-video-photos-ces-2017"&gt;three-screened laptop&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;gorgeous, modular desktop concept&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_1HmiixTb3AAymExwknzWxCi-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942593/zephyrsmoke.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer says that if you spend a prolonged period of time in a higher-risk setting, like an indoor location, change the Zephyr’s filters as soon as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7DvjmH"&gt;Some saw the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Zephyr’s announcement in January&lt;/a&gt; as a play to capitalize on a global crisis. It didn’t help Razer’s case that it didn’t initially have any certification to prove that the mask would be safe to use in a pandemic — and it still doesn’t. The mask is FDA-registered, which basically means that the FDA is aware that this product exists, not that the agency is backing the Zephyr’s effectiveness. Razer says it isn’t a medical device or personal protective equipment (PPE), and it hasn’t been specifically tested against COVID-19. The company hasn’t shared whether it’s seeking further approval. It’s being marketed now as an air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFeD7A"&gt;It says its filters are N95-grade and have 99 percent BFE (bacteria filtration efficiency). It claims that the mask can filter 99 percent of air particles that are 0.3 microns in size. Notably, the company says that it offers this level of protection for air that you breathe in, as well as for air that you breathe out. As for whether that means it can block COVID-19 particles, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/"&gt;the answer is a little complicated&lt;/a&gt;. The virus particles are smaller than 0.3 microns, but that post linked from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; says they usually bond to much larger molecules, like water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9L6eM"&gt;To install the filters, you simply remove the magnetically attached caps of the two air valves and slot in a filter with the black section facing the mask. There’s one more filter that gets inserted underneath the see-through plastic window. Each set of N95-grade filters can be used for up to 72 hours before they’re no longer effective at filtration. Razer says that if you spend a prolonged period of time in a high-risk environment, such as an indoor location, you should replace the filters as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVZVCCv2KuHAbJGZEwqOaDxw6kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942600/zephyrfilter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two circular N95-grade filters fit between the Zephyr’s fans and their magnetic caps. There’s another filter to change just beneath the see-through plastic window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACU9AO"&gt;The Zephyr has style and features not usually seen with your average face mask. It looks like a futuristic gas mask, with Razer’s Chroma RGB lining the edges of the air intake and exhausts where you’ll install the N95 filters. The LEDs are mostly for show, but they’re also being touted as an accessibility feature since they, working in tandem with its see-through window covering the mouth, could theoretically make it possible to lip-read and to catch more non-verbal cues that masks can cover up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XufmBf"&gt;For those who feel like they aren’t getting enough air flow, the Zephyr feature fans near the filters that are intended to make it easier to breathe. A button on the mask can turn on the fans and toggle between two speeds: 4200 and 6200 revolutions per minute. There’s a third air chamber located near the bottom of the mouth area, but it’s passive and doesn’t feature a fan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLo1fi"&gt;The Zephyr has a dual strap design that it says can fit all head sizes, with one strap fitting around your neck and a strap with a fastening mechanism that secures around the back of your head. Both straps, as well as the pieces that touch your nose and chin on the front, feature silicone. The silicone components that touch your face can be removed for easy cleaning. Though, Razer warns against wiping the inner side of the plastic window, as it could mess up the anti-fog coating that makes it easier to see your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YrqPDfX7A1LiSmF4NTNKoz4Yco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942609/zephyrback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10cDZP"&gt;Razer initially promised to install amplifiers and speakers in the Zephyr to give your voice a boost, but unfortunately, that feature didn’t make it into this first-gen product. According to Razer, it said that eliminating the feature allowed the Zephyr to shed some weight, add bigger air valves, and for its battery to last longer. However, it doesn’t rule out that the feature may appear in future iterations of the Zephyr. This was disappointing news to people like my partner, who is a teacher. The idea of not having to scream through a mask all day seemed, to her, like a killer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CsDjI"&gt;The Zephyr can be operated entirely by its built-in buttons, but it also supports Bluetooth connectivity to control its RGB lights via the Zephyr app for Android and iOS. Its built-in battery is supposed to last up to eight hours per charge, but that’s if you aren’t using any RGB lights and have the fans set to their lowest setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hBNp"&gt;Many people — myself included — appreciate the anonymity provided by normal face masks, so the idea of wearing the Zephyr every day seems like an attention-grabbing exercise that I wouldn’t enjoy. Not to mention that owning the Zephyr is costly out of the gate and will get even more expensive as you need to buy more filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR1oXD"&gt;We’ll be covering the Zephyr more soon, but even sooner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;health tech reporter Nicole Wetsman and I will take the stage at On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; on October 23rd to demo the Zephyr and ask Razer a bunch of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYqvP6"&gt;Have any questions about the mask? Let us know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kraken V3 headsets offer a redesigned look with refined sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjQvxEItKOzgIbXcEJlNV7MU1ng=/1x0:6529x4352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027124/krakenv3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The middle-of-the-road Kraken 3 HyperSense is shown here. It costs $129.99 and plugs into devices via its USB-A plug.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LY2T3d"&gt;Razer has announced the Kraken V3 lineup, which has a refreshed design and new features. At the top of the offering is Razer’s wireless Kraken V3 Pro, which costs $199.99 and has built-in haptics. If wireless isn’t important to you, the Kraken V3 HyperSense for $129.99 has the same haptics feature, but with a few other tweaks. The $99.99 wired Kraken V3 doesn’t feature haptics, but it’s otherwise the same as the Kraken V3 HyperSense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHSTii"&gt;Compared to the previous generation, the V3 looks less bulky and garish. Many of Razer’s headsets have skewed toward looking more like over-ear headphones, and this one’s no exception. Some of its features are borrowed from other Razer headsets. Each Kraken V3 headset has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;Razer’s 50mm TriForce drivers that originated in the BlackShark V2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/28/17913228/razer-nari-ultimate-gaming-headset-hypersense-thx-spatial-audio"&gt;Nari headset comes the HyperSense haptic feedback&lt;/a&gt; to two of the three Kraken V3 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTsaX"&gt;The most appealing Kraken V3 is the Pro. It costs $199.99 and is coming in Q4 2021, while the other two models launch today. The Pro has the most amount of features and more premium build materials, in addition to cutting the cord. It has leatherette-covered ear cups and headband (other versions have a soft fabric), and its USB-A 2.4GHz dongle works with PC, PlayStation consoles, and with the Nintendo Switch dock. This high-end variant of the Kraken V3 also works wired via its 3.5mm jack, and it charges via USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kraken V3 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmfkRNRjYGeE8aO8UekgjG1yHdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942683/krakenv3pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kraken V3 Pro charges via USB-C and has the best build materials of the three headsets announced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dOQHYG"&gt;Compared to the other two models, the Pro’s detachable microphone is a “supercardioid” type instead of the standard cardioid mic. Supercardioid mic pickups have a narrower focus, so it could be great for picking up your voice and little else. Of course, it wouldn’t be a true Razer product without Chroma RGB support. Each of the three headsets let you customize the color that displays on the logo and the circular trim of LEDs that surround it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nr3kW"&gt;Another big perk of the Kraken V3 Pro, in addition to the wired V3 HyperSense that costs $129.99, are the built-in haptics actuators. Razer claims that its haptics can translate sounds into vibrations in real time. Haptics company Lofelt confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it worked with Razer on these headsets, and that its L5 actuators and &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/qku6b8nf1d79/76s0L6xb9GBUdSMb3828AH/64695fe11161bd683e73ca757997e139/Elevating-Haptic-Technology-with-Lofelt-Wave.pdf"&gt;Lofelt Wave tech&lt;/a&gt; are utilized to accomplish the real-time haptics here. Given that these are actuators and not rumble motors, the sounds should feel more punchy and accentuated. I’m looking forward to trying this, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22440206/lofelt-vtx-ax-wave-haptic-framework-qualcomm-7-8-series-snapdragon"&gt;Lofelt’s expertise in the space&lt;/a&gt;. Razer lets you tweak the haptics with a button on the Kraken V3 Pro and V3 HyperSense. Not every game or movie scene is going to sound better with haptics, so it’ll be nice to be able to change the settings on the fly as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM00oA"&gt;The most affordable version of the Kraken V3 is the base model that costs $99.99. It’s missing the haptics, but it features the same sound performance and design as the pricier options. It plugs in via USB-A, and you can change the color of the LEDs through Razer Synapse, as you can with the other two options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYWR7q"&gt;It has been a while since Razer revisited its Kraken lineup of headsets, but these upgrades make it seem like it was worth the wait. I look forward to trying these — particularly the Pro — and we’ll have more coverage soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer launches its own PC components with liquid coolers, case fans, and power supplies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkiainPeCvoF8lZDYSlcw3i3d1g=/450x0:5310x3240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027114/razerdesktopcomponents.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s new PC components.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e11OoO"&gt;Razer is expanding into PC components today with the launch of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers, case fans, and even platinum-rated power supplies. As you’d expect, all three include RGB lighting, a signature of Razer hardware. There’s even a PWM fan controller that will control up to eight fans and integrates into Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfKtZI"&gt;The Razer Hanbo is the company’s all-in-one cooler with an addressable RGB pump cap. Razer has partnered with Asetek to create this AIO cooler, and it says the Hanbo is designed for maximum thermal performance and silent operation. The pump orientates 360 degrees, so you can place it in any case configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAkDITPdt1ZpBeaa6yaDlxpucRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944405/Razer_Hanbo_AIO_aRGB_360mm_Key_Visual_Updated.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Hanbo AIO comes in 240mm and 360mm radiator sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHc7U2"&gt;Razer is making both 240mm and 360mm radiator sizes available, but the company is releasing pricing information just yet. These AIOs will arrive at some point in November, and Razer says it will continue to collaborate with Asetek on new AIO coolers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo6Yqq"&gt;Razer’s new Kunai fans are also designed to help you cool your PC build. These case fans use hydraulic bearings and will be available in both 120mm and 140mm sizes. Razer has built an RGB ring into the front and rear, offering 18 addressable LEDs on the 120mm fan and 22 addressable LEDs on the 140mm version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Tr1lz"&gt;You’ll be able to control the Kunai fans using Razer’s Synapse software, offering up to 2,200rpm on the 120mm and up to 1,600rpm on the 140mm version. Razer is particularly proud of the static pressure in these case fans and says it has 70 percent more than the competition. You’ll be able to daisy chain these fans or control them in sequence together.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PWM fan controller can support up to eight of Razer’s case fans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lBb5gH"&gt;RGB case fans wouldn’t be complete without a fan controller, so Razer has also created a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) fan controller. It will support up to eight Razer Kunai fans and integrates fully into Synapse to provide customizable fan curve controls. Razer has placed a magnet at the rear of the controller, so when you go to hide it during cable management, it will secure to any steel at the back of a typical case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R29ubb"&gt;Razer’s Kunai case fans start at $44.99, and the PWM fan controller is priced at $49.99. Both are available today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVKuLwfIw_JKq3UIB7Ip7x8laXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944410/Razer_Katana_1200_Watt_Power_Supply_Key_Visual.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Katana power supplies come with full Chroma compatibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StzCvX"&gt;The final Razer PC component is a range of Katana power supplies. These platinum-rated ATX power supplies are fully modular and include a zero RPM aRGB fan with full Razer Chroma compatibility. A variety of capacities will be available from 750W to 1,200W, and there’s even a 1,600W Titanium-rated PSU if you really want to go all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alfwAM"&gt;Razer says it’s using Japanese 105-degree rated capacitors and high-quality components for its power supplies and expects to start shipping them in early 2022 once they’ve been fully certified. Razer hasn’t announced pricing for the Katana power supplies yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFjdId"&gt;Razer is entering a crowded market with its expansion into PC components, with players like Corsair, Cooler Master, NZXT, and Noctua all fighting to cool custom PC builds. Without knowing full pricing, it’s hard to see exactly where Razer fits in yet, but the company’s Chroma and RGB lighting compatibility will certainly be appealing to some. Let’s hope the pricing is appealing, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A professor straight up dies in the new Pokémon Legends: Arceus trailer </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yj_T95opNSAgjNUZnaNvWmCMthg=/104x0:1151x698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026855/FCO7qGWXoAEOJsO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqGZl4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company released a new teaser trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698264/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s causing a bit of concern. The 2-minute video features found footage of an unknown professor’s trek through a snowy wilderness as he attempts to document pokémon using a strange device he’s found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckORIN"&gt;The professor — who will probably become the fandom’s newest zaddy because he sounds really cute — can’t contain his excitement as he stumbles on a sneeze of snorunts. But because of this man’s gleeful disregard for his own safety approaching dangerous (but oh so cute) animals in their natural habitats, it’s easy to see what happens next. The professor makes his way deep into a forest where he spots what he thinks is a zorua and zoroark. Suddenly, he’s struck by a shadow and goes silent, with the camera falling to the ground at an odd angle. The pokémon he was spying come into focus, revealing Hisuian versions of zorua and zoroark. The zorua looks concerned and sniffs at the camera for a moment before slinking away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4wx70"&gt;In the language of found footage movies, this guy is dead. Fans on social media registered shock and concern about the professor’s assumed fate, but obviously not before gushing over how cute Hisuian Zorua is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcoCaK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NOOOOO THE ZORUA IS SO CUTEEEE WHEN IT RUNS UP TO THE CAMERA rip that dude tho &lt;a href="https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs"&gt;https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nate   (@chimeraboyz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chimeraboyz/status/1451178230459797508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wAo5A"&gt;Professor Zaddy’s alleged death on camera is both shocking and not really shocking if you think about it. On the one hand, The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company has crafted a very family-friendly image for its 25-year-old, billion-dollar, planet-spanning, cultural phenomena. On the other hand, this is a franchise built on the premise of what is essentially fantastical cockfighting. And if you read the Pokédex entries of any number of mon, like &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hatterene_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries"&gt;hatterne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mimikyu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries_2"&gt;mimikyu&lt;/a&gt;, for example, things&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;get &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; universe. So a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game trailer that mercs a professor for the crime of being overly enthusiastic about pokémon isn’t really tonally far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHm1W9"&gt;A much tamer interpretation is that the shadow spirited the professor back in time to the Hisui region where the game is set, which would be a neat explanation as to why this &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game takes place in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWVv7z"&gt;We’ll find out for sure when &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; hits the Nintendo Switch on January 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island are filing for a federal union election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IWYg7mo8m9vYmzNAa7UQA0ixtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026830/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers may get a chance to vote to form a union | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvDGUV"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island, New York are preparing to file for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board on October 25th, after getting signatures on union authorization cards from more than 2,000 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cqs2Vr"&gt;The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is an independent group of employees that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;trying to organize workers&lt;/a&gt; at four Amazon warehouses in Staten Island. It’s led by former Amazon worker Christian Smalls, who was fired in March after he helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organize a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s JFK8 warehouse to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic. Amazon has said Smalls was fired for violating safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQBNGb"&gt;“This is truly a remarkable historical moment for all Amazon workers all over the country,” the ALU said in a statement Thursday. “We’re not getting complacent, and we now need the support of the communities more than ever as our fight is just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;If the union’s petition is granted approval by the NLRB, it would mean the second-ever unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse this year. In April, a union drive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; failed dramatically when workers voted against unionization by a margin of more than two-to-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFkbWo"&gt;The organizing union later contested the validity of the election, citing concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a USPS mailbox installed in the Bessemer fulfillment center parking lot during the drive&lt;/a&gt;. An assessment by the NLRB in August recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;a new election for Bessemer&lt;/a&gt; warehouse workers, saying the installation of the mailbox had likely violated US labor law, although an official ruling has yet to be issued by the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lcknwE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Unionizing Amazon warehouses was never going to be easy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q1KVrA"&gt;Still, the ALU is confident the Staten Island drive will be more successful. “Since the campaign has launched, Amazon has not wasted any time union busting,” the ALU said in its statement Thursday. “We have endured the same strategies used in Bessemer, Alabama, from signs in the bathrooms and breaks, to the same union-busting firms and consultants being brought in to walk around the workplace and divide the workers. Regardless of Amazon anti-union attempts, ALU has earned the trust of the workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ibwMl"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its workers have always had the choice of whether to join a union, but that the company doesn’t think unions are the best answer for its employees. Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;devoted significant resources&lt;/a&gt; to fight against workers organizing; in just the past few months, the NLRB has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;Amazon threatened&lt;/a&gt; and, in some cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-nlrb/u-s-labor-board-claims-amazon-illegally-fired-warehouse-worker-idUSKBN28R319"&gt;fired workers&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;protested its handling&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 cases at warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8sAuE"&gt;“Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes—quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle,“ Nantel said. “The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated—these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few.” Nantel added that the company had made “great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjvMnj"&gt;At the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year, workers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;Amazon warehouses across the country&lt;/a&gt; raised safety concerns, saying the company didn’t notify them when workers tested positive for the virus. As part of the drive, the Amazon Labor Union is demanding higher wages, safer working conditions, more paid time off options, and longer break periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmthzo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z6QxnT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqH4CY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1WkpJc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Donald Trump’s new social media SPAC, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Trump talks on a phone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_P7ddo8n7KihQWb-nlP3SxruWoY=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026800/34252546901_796261c8af_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/whitehouse/34252546901/" target="_blank"&gt;Shealah Craighead / The White House&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wnfx2i"&gt;In his latest attempt to return to the social media spotlight, Donald Trump is now turning to a current darling of the startup world: the special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrqOe6"&gt;Trump &lt;a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/press-releases/announcement-10-20-2021"&gt;announced Wednesday night&lt;/a&gt; that he has a new company called Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group (TMTG) and that he would be merging this new company with a SPAC called Digital World Acquisition Company (DWAC). If completed, the deal would turn Trump’s new media company into one that’s publicly traded on the Nasdaq. And it would give TMTG enough money to get a new Twitter clone off the ground called “Truth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDWb7Z"&gt;The surprise deal is already turning DWAC into a meme stock, and it raises a fair number of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lfgdzO"&gt;Wait, what’s a SPAC?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kGKJhf"&gt;Briefly, SPACs are shell companies that get listed on exchanges like the Nasdaq and exist for the sole purpose of eventually merging with companies that want to go public. Someone, often from the finance world, starts the company and gets a few other people to throw money in the pot in exchange for shares of the shell — typically sold at $10 a pop. They set themselves a deadline (usually around two years) by which they aim to find a company to merge with and tell the market which industry they’re targeting — though they can really merge with any willing business. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;far more detailed explainer if you’re curious&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="islhcB"&gt;Trump has a new company?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nfwyYE"&gt;Apparently! It was registered in Delaware in February but somehow went unnoticed until Wednesday night. Anyway, Trump has &lt;em&gt;very big &lt;/em&gt;ambitions for TMTG, according to the truly ludicrous 22-page &lt;a href="https://tmtgcorp.com/company-overview/"&gt;investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; that was published on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XQw9ODi8-5xfKcCFdY0sUWWvGgc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945054/Screen_Shot_2021_10_21_at_11.53.11_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TMTG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seriously, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://tmtgcorp.com/company-overview/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;presentation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; must be seen to be believed.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NAn8mx"&gt;TMTG’s ambitions don’t end with Truth Social, Trump’s Twitter clone. Ultimately, TMTG aims to be a conglomerate with plans to — in all seriousness — operate a news network that competes with CNN, a streaming platform that competes with Disney+, and a technology services business that competes with Amazon Web Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X1JclN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trump Media &amp;amp; Technology Group starts with a Twitter clone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WN0Qfl"&gt;So far, the only part of this that exists are bits of Truth Social, which appears to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Techmeme/status/1451211912218218497"&gt;a fork of decentralized social network&lt;/a&gt; Mastodon. The app already has issues. Some journalists have already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikaelthalen/status/1451017501026885632?s=21"&gt;created accounts&lt;/a&gt; on the app with usernames like “donaldtrump” and “mikepence.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNPlsn"&gt;The promotional materials for Truth are full of fake messages from brands that didn’t give TMTG permission to be used. In one image, a “@ChevyTrucks” account has posted messages about a 2022 model year Chevy Tahoe; Chevy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was “unaware of this project.” “There is no 2022 Chevy Tahoe EV,” a General Motors spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e7lw9w"&gt;Other messages include headlines from news outlets like &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Variety. TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s editor-in-chief, Matthew Panzarino, says he didn’t approve the headline. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; didn’t respond to a request for comment. &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; didn’t have an on-the-record comment. If none of these brands were involved, it’s probably a safe bet that they aren’t getting back to us because they’re busy calling their lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="i4JHh1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've approved some clunkers. Just not this one.&lt;/p&gt;— Panzer (@panzer) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/panzer/status/1450992645031956480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vz2tSc"&gt;Meanwhile, the Terms of Service for Truth Social include &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bradheath/status/1450997391142817792?s=21"&gt;a rule that prohibits users from disparaging Truth&lt;/a&gt; on the platform — despite TMTG promoting Truth as a “big tent” where “all are welcome.” You are also not allowed to write posts with too many capital letters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="7eMBmG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The TMTG investor presentation has no details about money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X5rmLV"&gt;The investor presentation is also notable for what it’s missing: details on &lt;em&gt;the money&lt;/em&gt;. Usually, these things at &lt;em&gt;least &lt;/em&gt;glance at what kind of money the company seeking a merger has and what it projects future revenue might be. Usually, this is part of the motivation for SPACing in the first place: IPOs don’t let you project future revenue in quite the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSrG0g"&gt;TMTG’s presentation doesn’t say a word about revenue, past or future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="d0Z4X1"&gt;Haven’t there been a bunch of right-wing Twitter clones?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SQPlDt"&gt;There have! Gettr and Parler were both founded in the wake of the Trump bans, with older networks like Rumble seeing significant growth too. All three benefit from a new sense among conservatives that moderation on Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are biased against them. In theory, that should create a huge potential audience for conservative-friendly alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxHDX5"&gt;In practice, the idea has run into a lot of problems that are likely to repeat themselves in Trump’s “Truth” project. The biggest challenge for any social network is scale: if there’s no one posting, then there’s nothing to read, which means fewer readers and less incentive to post. Outside splashy launches, most conservative-focused networks have struggled to maintain that scale — particularly Parler, where user growth &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2021/06/02/parlers-popularity-plummets-as-data-reveals-little-appetite-for-returning-free-speech-app-favored-by-conservatives/?sh=69fc5b9d5e13"&gt;slowed to a trickle&lt;/a&gt; over the summer. Right-wing platforms also struggled to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383841/mike-lindell-social-network-frank-free-speech-conservative-censorship"&gt;set basic policies&lt;/a&gt; around hate speech and violent threats, caught between “free speech” branding and a lingering resistance to the nihilist chaos of spaces like 4chan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V2qDrx"&gt;But didn’t this specific thing already happen? I remember hearing Trump launched a social network.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5OMiyW"&gt;He said that he was going to, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419850/donald-trump-social-media-platform-ban-twitter-facebook"&gt;when it finally launched&lt;/a&gt;, it was just a blog for his press releases. We’re assuming this won’t just be another blog, but at this point, who knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7EClB"&gt;Who runs the company Trump wants to merge with?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Lyz7L8"&gt;In the broadest sense, a bunch of money guys. It was started by a man named Peter Orlando, who has been an investment banker and ran a sugar trading company. The SPAC’s chief financial officer is Luis Orleans-Braganza&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;a serial entrepreneur who is also a&lt;em&gt; current member &lt;/em&gt;of Brazil’s National Congress, was a member of Jair Bolsonaro’s former party, and the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2020-01-06/royalists-pine-for-days-of-empire-in-bolsonaros-brazil"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e135da74-179a-11e6-b197-a4af20d5575e"&gt;heir to Brazil’s defunct throne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NI335j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The SPAC is run by a prince, an investment banker, and a “disruptive technology investing enthusiast”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j3bu3L"&gt;Orlando is involved in a few other SPACs, though he has yet to find a merger partner for any of them. Most recently, he has been trying to merge one with &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-14/hydrogen-fuel-firm-ecombustible-eyes-up-to-1-billion-spac-deal"&gt;a hydrogen fuel company&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1GUwS"&gt;The existing directors (or nominees to be directors) who already own shares of the Digital World Acquisition Company SPAC have... let’s say, &lt;em&gt;eclectic&lt;/em&gt; backgrounds. Lee Jacobson was an executive at Midway Games and Atari and also ran a mobile games analytics company that went bankrupt in 2019. Bruce Garelick is a hedge fund guy who describes himself as a “disruptive technology investing enthusiast” in DWAC’s SEC filings; he went to Wharton — Trump’s alma mater. Justin Shaner is a real estate investor and developer. Brian Shevland is a portfolio manager who also went to Wharton. Eric Swider has a history working in the resorts business. Rodrigo Veloso created a bottled water company that actually succeeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBpUZf"&gt;But it’s hard to say if they will stick around if a merger gets done. One of the problems with SPACs is that people who help create them are financially incentivized to walk away after the merger. The &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-08-16/hedge-funds-are-demanding-their-spac-money-back-too-fast"&gt;money is just too good&lt;/a&gt; for those who leave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tFAXV3"&gt;What is a PIPE, and why does it matter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lG7DEz"&gt;I apologize for another acronym. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwIpR3"&gt;SPAC mergers often involve a parallel funding round known as the “public investment in private equity,” or PIPE. This means that a company that’s merging gets the SPAC money &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; some&lt;em&gt; more&lt;/em&gt; money from outside investors. In return for that money, the outside investors get a chunk of the new company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4W0kf8"&gt;The outside investors are usually institutions like banks and pension funds. These investors often add legitimacy — even prestige — by having kicked the tires on the company. That can make other investors more comfortable with the SPAC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="3OrL6N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Again — show me the money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTbwRN"&gt;Trump’s merger plan makes no mention of a PIPE. This is honestly very funny! Remember how we talked earlier about Trump’s ambitions to take on Disney, Amazon, and CNN? Okay. So the pile of money that he’s getting from the SPAC is about $300 million. That’s &lt;em&gt;adorable.&lt;/em&gt; Netflix will spend&lt;em&gt; $17 billion &lt;/em&gt;on content alone in fiscal 2021, and they don’t have to build a platform from scratch, which would be a significant expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WQ2sjq"&gt;Why would Trump do this?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ED1S7M"&gt;Because he misses being on Twitter. If he is going to run for president again in 2024, he’ll need a social platform that isn’t just a shitty blog. And while right-wing social networks have failed as platforms, they’ve succeeded as a way of getting attention and dressing up general public indifference as a form of ominous censorship. Whatever happens with this new project, it will give Trump a great excuse to complain about Facebook at rallies. Maybe that’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lh1fbP"&gt;I have to also imagine that there’s an element of financial gamesmanship here. Trump has exploited tax loopholes for decades. He’s pushed banks to grant him risky loans, and when those loans went bad, he’d go to extreme lengths to put them off — like when he sued Deutsche Bank and claimed he shouldn’t pay them back &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/business/05norris.html"&gt;because they helped cause the Great Recession&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="egr2ZX"&gt;So, um, why would this work?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kSEqKK"&gt;Well, remember meme stocks? Donald Trump had a whole meme presidency. Given the strength of his online fanbase and the general proliferation of “we like the stock” investing, it seems possible the plan is just to launch the company and have his true believers buy in. SPACs have been, at times, popular targets for the new class of casual retail traders. It’s not hard to imagine many people buying stock in this company simply for the lulz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="E7RVHM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s already a meme stock, even if it’s not meant to be&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0YZSmE"&gt;In fact, this may already be working! At the time this story was published, shares of the DWAC SPAC are already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SPACtrack/status/1451220906983006213"&gt;approaching the record for number of shares traded in one day&lt;/a&gt;. That extreme volatility has only lifted the stock price to $25, though, meaning we’re not seeing the same kind of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;coordination that propped up the valuation of, say, GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z31x6W"&gt;But there’s risk here, too. If those existing SPAC shareholders leave — as they are kind of financially incentivized to do — then regular people buying the stock could wind up owning shares of a company that’s less valuable than promised. CNBC recently determined that &lt;em&gt;97 percent &lt;/em&gt;of SPACs that have not yet completed a merger are&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/28/higher-quality-spac-sponsors-must-emerge-for-once-red-hot-space-to-turn-around.html"&gt; trading below their initial $10 share price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvSBBD"&gt;Of course, if this deal doesn’t work out, it wouldn’t be the first time that Trump has left other people — including his supporters — holding the bag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JARqep"&gt;&lt;em&gt;With reporting by Mitchell Clark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="426ohD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 2:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Luis Orleans-Braganza was a member of Jair Bolsonaro’s former party, not the Brazilian president’s current one as previously stated. Bolsonaro’s last name was also misspelled. We regret the errors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google shares its commitment to Matter, promises future interoperability between smart home platforms  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwgmA6pFjrbcPQk9-l7l93inf0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026722/dseifert_20210323_4485_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s Nest Hub 2nd Gen has a Thread radio built-in that will be updated in 2022 to enable Matter support.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="In8SuQ"&gt;Google gave a glimpse into how the new smart home standard Matter might actually work in our smart homes today, and it’s looking pretty exciting. At its &lt;a href="https://eventsonair.withgoogle.com/events/smarthomesummit2021?utm_campaign=Q3_2021_SHS"&gt;Google Smart Home Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the company announced new tools to help developers build devices that work with both Google Home, the new connectivity standard Matter, and across any other Matter-complaint ecosystems. This means that, yes — one day, very soon — the (new) Nest Thermostat could work in the Apple Home app without the need for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22678088/home-assistant-amber-smart-home-hub-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; or other workarounds. And if those two can work together, well, anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xu0fn3"&gt;Due to arrive next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430666/matter-project-chip-smart-home-partnership-apple-amazon-google-zigbee"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; is an open smart home application protocol that promises to make smart home devices talk to each other no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made them. It wants to take the hard work out of choosing, setting up, and integrating devices with your smart home and voice assistants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDjQVs"&gt;“Matter is a very big initiative for us,” Kevin Po, Senior Product Manager at Google, told me in a briefing ahead of today’s announcements. “It will really solve that interoperability choice, that frustrating purchasing and setup experience for the user.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/650T2DjqJkUchNh9tZwvw1SEkkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944994/Fg39T_wZn6cXSyiUsE5VWFJcZYp0HgK4Etnqn9wpNloMdq0RMXnAJdYaXtPwMsaRT_OtxaQHJxKLgjjmZrZmZwRbcSM2WSQ1UEZCxIGaSJg5BVD9crA7hFPauYbso0cLOd6xGLMpiVlCAmR63VS7ihfU8L6kPfruCDqytEUqzeb_uH0J_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the Smart Home Summit, Google shared images of how device set-up may work with Matter-enabled devices across different apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6fURmm"&gt;At the event, the company doubled down on its commitment to supporting Matter and its main supporting protocol, Thread (a low-powered mesh network), across its entire ecosystem. It also revealed a new name for its smart home efforts: Google Home. While consumers have been familiar with that moniker for a while, on the backend, developers have dealt with a myriad of different services they needed to understand and pick through to figure out how to make their device work with Google Assistant and Google Nest devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khp3sH"&gt;The new Google Home brings development for device setup, automation capabilities, voice control, and Android and Google Nest devices under one umbrella. The new name is “for our entire smart home platform and developer program,” said Michele Turner, Senior Director of Product for Google’s Smart Home Ecosystem, during the event’s keynote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8gm7n"&gt;A new Google Home Developer Center was also announced. A one-stop shop for developing anything smart home-related, the Developer Center introduces some new tools to help accelerate the adoption of Matter in the smart home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5M5PU"&gt;A Google Home Device SDK for Matter can help developers quickly build and integrate Matter devices so they’ll be ready when the standard launches next year. This is also when Google has committed to updating its Nest and Android devices with Matter support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hhxXnI"&gt;Native Android Support via Google Play Services and a new Google Home Mobile SDK will bring Matter support to mobile devices and apps to help streamline smart home device set up. This should mean setting up a Matter-enabled device — such as a light bulb or smart plug — will be as simple as powering it up and opening an app (either Google Home or the manufacturer’s app). The app will then do most of the heavy lifting of connecting to Wi-Fi and Thread, and any other Matter devices you have. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6zBWq90eJZkpNmfa-brqk1XLH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944944/9pc16xHlCuF_UeXbhcH2Ln92s8R4glbH6h3f8Fd5MyWI10AQ7ZgpYkWxETyplgBS8GHsFG62THDGT4k5A9SCfTTonAAa3cYA3Bdq52B_7YNZw1Npd_25TId9cfU0COkTIY_K2_Y_kOeIwMzTNK1OhG_bevn22F7ty_cQ5rSpK5LYyl3Z_s1600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Home Developer Center launches next year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CC0SOm"&gt;There are a lot of questions still around Matter — but from what Google revealed today, it seems that while a unified setup experience is coming, a unified app is not on the cards. There won’t be a Matter-branded app that you can put all your devices into — instead, you can choose to use one or more apps from a Matter-enabled ecosystem to control your home with. This is similar to how HomeKit-enabled devices work with Apple’s smart home now — you can use Apple’s Home app or a third-party app to control them. Each app will likely offer different features and controls based on how the manufacturers look to differentiate themselves, so you can choose which suits your needs best. Whether you have to install the manufacturer’s app for firmware updates or other reasons is not clear yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1z0P7"&gt;The most important thing for smart home users is that all Matter-enabled devices will work with all apps that support Matter. So, if Apple opens up its Home app to Matter (and it is on the board of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;CSA&lt;/a&gt;, which oversees the initiative), and Google turns on Matter support in its Nest Thermostat — you will be able to control it in the Apple Home app. “If they are compliant from a Matter of perspective, there’s no reason why that can’t be possible,” confirmed Po.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtTdgQ"&gt;In other Google Home news, the company announced the introduction of Suggested Routines in the Google Home app. This should go some way to bringing back more of the functionality third-party device makers lost when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627719/google-works-with-nest-shutdown-clarification-statement-update"&gt;Works With Nest program shut down &lt;/a&gt;(some of which returned with the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9251759?hl=en"&gt;Home / Away presence sensing option&lt;/a&gt; introduced at this event last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkncNc"&gt;Suggested Routines will let manufacturers build their own Routines (which enable your devices to automatically activate) in the Google Home app to interact with both Nest devices and any other third-party devices you have linked to the app. They’ll be able to use what Google calls “context signals” — voice, time, and device/sensor state — to trigger the Routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgJZi9"&gt;Google is sharing details on its announcements from the Google Smart Home Developer Summit on its &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/home"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the new tools are available in preview now and rolling out next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google details extensive phishing campaign targeting YouTubers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b_ybhS7hjiPTg9VkpneHNsDoli4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026711/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="POLvc0"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/phishing-campaign-targets-youtube-creators-cookie-theft-malware/"&gt;put out a report&lt;/a&gt; detailing a phishing campaign directed at YouTubers, which involved around 15,000 fake accounts and over a million messages to targets. The phishing attempts were carried out by multiple hackers, and the company says it’s recovered around 4,000 accounts since late 2019. The attackers weren’t just trying to get the creators to put their password into a fake website, though — they were trying to infect their computer with malware that would steal their login cookies, which is a much more intensive attack than sending a link and waiting for someone to get sloppy with their passwords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haAyEl"&gt;YouTube doesn’t publicly say who was recruiting the hackers, only that they were using Russian-language forums to advertise. The campaign’s focus on YouTube accounts, instead of traditional targets like government computer systems or banks, shows how valuable gaining access to influencers’ social accounts and audiences’ attention can be. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTDAyM-xnoQRQga7LWTBHZYMsqY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944886/table_1.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the advertisements posted to forums trying to recruit hackers to phish YouTubers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQldVK"&gt;The hack generally worked like this: hackers reached out to the YouTubers, pretending to offer ad deals promoting a VPN, antivirus program, or other software on their channel. If the creator agreed, they got a link that, if clicked, would infect their computer using a variety of malware programs, usually designed to steal cookies and passwords. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJGy4A"&gt;Because of the prevalence of two-factor authentication (whether through prompts, codes, or hardware keys), the cookies may have been an especially valuable target — hackers were looking at the ones that websites use to store a user’s log-in session (these files are the reason you don’t have to re-enter your password every time you visit a site). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc49by"&gt;If the hackers got the YouTuber’s cookie (and were able to use it before it expired) they may have been able to take over the channel, and potentially even change passwords to lock the rightful owners out. Of course, since YouTube accounts are tied to Google accounts, these kinds of attacks also gave hackers access to Gmail, Google Drive, Photos, and other services that were tied to that account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aJ5Dyz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hackers were either able to sell the hacked accounts or run Bitcoin scams on them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NazuGe"&gt;According to Google, after all that work, hackers were able to sell the accounts for anywhere from $3 to $4,000. While that feels relatively cheap to get a YouTube account with a good number of subscribers, the numbers may be so low because the hackers wanted to hang on to accounts that they thought could really pull in money — last year, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7jxm8/hackers-hijacked-popular-youtube-channels-bitcoin-scams"&gt;tech leaker Jon Prosser told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that hackers were able to make $10,000 by livestreaming a scam on his channel, promising to double any Bitcoins viewers sent in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6Om6z"&gt;This campaign, and ones like it, could be a motivating factor in why Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/making-sign-safer-and-more-convenient/"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that YouTube creators would be required to turn on two-step verification (which makes having both a password and something like a phone or security key a requirement for logging in), and why it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710421/google-security-2fa-inactive-account-management"&gt;giving away thousands of security keys&lt;/a&gt; to “high risk users” on an annual basis. They don’t stop hackers who’ve taken over your computer, but making the attacks more expensive might help slow them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TxOrRh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Like the giveaway scam comments, we’ll all probably have to live with phishing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgl9Cy"&gt;Google’s also been fighting the hackers in other ways, blocking their emails and files, as well as warning users when they’re visiting a malicious website in Chrome. But given the value that creators’ accounts have, criminals probably won’t be dissuaded from trying to get them — like the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1448336081695412224?s=20"&gt;scam comments that show up all across YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ever-evolving phishing attacks will likely be a part of life online for the foreseeable future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Among Us is coming to Xbox, PlayStation, and Xbox Game Pass on December 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oP_p487HW5Tm7nzfYP9UXAW_d0I=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026536/Among_Us_Hero_JPG.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TsivCO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is arriving on Xbox and PlayStation on December 14th. The popular social deduction game will &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/among-us-launching-with-xbox-game-pass-on-december-14/"&gt;also launch on Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; on the same day and be available on Xbox One, Xbox Series S / X, PS4, and PS5 consoles. The announcement comes months after Sony confirmed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410775/among-us-playstation-4-5-ps4-ps5-ratchet-clank"&gt;coming to its PlayStation consoles&lt;/a&gt; this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWaCuk"&gt;Just like on other platforms, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; will support crossplay and online multiplayer across mobile, PC, and now consoles. The only difference between the two console versions is PlayStation players will get access to exclusive &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank-&lt;/em&gt;themed cosmetics. There’s a skin and hat to make your character look like Ratchet, and a pet that looks like Clank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKlpAs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; was a huge hit during the early stages of the pandemic, becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game"&gt;2020’s most-downloaded mobile game&lt;/a&gt;. Innersloth has been gradually improving the game over the past year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22526162/among-us-innersloth-new-modes-map-hide-and-seek-summer-game-fest-2021"&gt;revealing plans to add&lt;/a&gt; a hide and seek mode, visor cosmetics, and a fifth map earlier this year. Physical editions of the game are &lt;a href="https://www.innersloth.com/xbox-playstation-launch-on-dec-14/?utm_source=social&amp;amp;utm_medium=tweet&amp;amp;utm_campaign=console"&gt;also arriving in Europe&lt;/a&gt; on December 14th, with a US release due in January.&lt;/p&gt;
