    <title>Elon Musk called lidar a ‘crutch,’ but now Tesla is reportedly testing Luminar’s laser sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x70vRVQhXl2DuRlKlGYm_xN0b4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335101/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MYDxVn"&gt;A Tesla Model Y was photographed in Florida sporting rooftop lidar sensors made by buzzy sensor manufacturer Luminar. The sighting caused a bit of a stir among Tesla watchers, given Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s well-established disdain for the laser sensors commonly used by autonomous vehicle companies to create 3D maps of their environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjfeGd"&gt;Even more notably, Tesla has reportedly entered a partnership with Luminar to use lidar for “testing and developing,” &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/tesla-testing-luminar-laser-sensor-musk-called-fool-s-errand?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly this partnership entails we don’t know for sure — neither company is commenting. But it could point to some shortcomings in the technology Tesla is using to power its “Full Self-Driving” driver assist feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB5XIZ"&gt;The vehicle was spotted last week in Palm Beach, Florida, by Grayson Brulte, a consultant for the AV industry who lives in the area. After Brulte tweeted the photos of the Model Y with a rooftop rack of lidar sensors on May 20th, Luminar’s stock surged to its highest level yet. (The Florida-based company recently went public after being acquired by a “blank check” special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TrxEnU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Spotted in Palm Beach, Florida. A &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tesla?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Tesla&lt;/a&gt; Model Y with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LiDAR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#LiDAR&lt;/a&gt; and CA Manufacturing (MFG) Plates. Can anyone offer details/insights? &lt;a href="https://t.co/5Uh4WU0U41"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5Uh4WU0U41&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Grayson Brulte (@gbrulte) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gbrulte/status/1395356317410287617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vfYLQL"&gt;Luminar sold the lidar to Tesla as part of an agreement between the two companies, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. Also, the Model Y was sporting a manufacturer’s license plate that is registered to Tesla in California. The same plate has been spotted on other Tesla vehicles, including a prototype of the Cybertruck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JgYEV"&gt;It’s unlikely that Tesla will reverse its position on lidar based on a single vehicle. As Guidehouse’s Sam Abuelsamid told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, it’s more likely that Tesla is using Luminar’s lidar to validate its Full Self-Driving feature. But it’s still a noteworthy development given Musk’s vocal animosity toward the sensor. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16988628/elon-musk-lidar-self-driving-car-tesla"&gt;In a 2018 earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, Musk said, “In my view, it’s a crutch that will drive companies to a local maximum that they will find very hard to get out of.” He added, “Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z43CvF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Perhaps I am wrong, and I will look like a fool. But I am quite certain that I am not.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mP3y8d"&gt;Then a year later, he called lidar “a fool’s errand” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;during a presentation on Tesla’s efforts to build fully autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. “[A]nyone relying on LIDAR is doomed,” he added. “Doomed. Expensive sensors that are unnecessary. It’s like having a whole bunch of expensive appendices... you’ll see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3xWvu1"&gt;Musk said Tesla is trying to tackle a much bigger problem: passive optical recognition. This is why Tesla is banking on cameras as the key piece of hardware for autonomous vehicles. With their ever-increasing pixel resolution and the low price point, camera sensors are seen as indispensable for advanced driver assistance systems (like Tesla’s Autopilot) and fully autonomous systems. For Tesla, cameras are everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9feS5"&gt;Musk also walked back some of those comments in recent months. In a chat on Clubhouse, Musk admitted to “talking smack” about lidar but noted that SpaceX — his other company — has developed its own versions of the laser sensors to assist the Dragon capsule. In a recent earnings call, Musk spoke about moving away from using radar, stating, “We believe that a vision-only system is ultimately all that is needed for full autonomy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvzjKg"&gt;Luminar, which is based in Florida, went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398974/luminar-lidar-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merge-blank-check"&gt;public last year via a reverse merger&lt;/a&gt; with a SPAC. That merger valued the company at approximately $2.9 billion in “implied pro forma enterprise value,” with an equity value of $3.4 billion at closing. Luminar is also working with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22424726/pony-ai-luminar-lidar-robotaxi-california-china"&gt;Pony.ai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399389/luminar-airbus-lidar-aviation-evtol-partnership"&gt;Airbus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248415/volvo-luminar-lidar-self-driving-highway-pilot-spa2"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18144506/audi-self-driving-car-volkswagen-luminar-lidar"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/27/16373058/toyota-research-institute-self-driving-car-luminar"&gt;Toyota Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton is planning a new $400 million factory in Ohio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A runner trains on the Peloton Tread." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W0l8rUhF3RAbS8rLfExbZR9nCNk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69335093/akrales_190328_3240_0158.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zjp6Bh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;Peloton has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to invest $400 million in a US factory to produce its connected bikes and treadmills, located in Troy Township, Ohio — about half an hour south of Toledo. The facility, which is planned to be approximately a million square feet, is called the Peloton Output Park. Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/peloton-to-open-ohio-factory-in-2023-to-build-bikes-treadmills?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;hopes it will eventually lead to lower prices&lt;/a&gt; for its products, though its CEO John Foley admits that could take a few years to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBd6m5"&gt;Currently, Peloton mainly manufactures its fitness equipment in Taiwan, while many of its customers are in the US. This caused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;expensive shipping delays&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year as the company ran into both &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/24/peloton-to-invest-400-million-on-first-us-production-facility-in-ohio.html"&gt;heightened demand&lt;/a&gt; and long shipping times resulting from the pandemic. The company’s factory announcement is also colored by the shadow of its safety struggles and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423745/peloton-recall-timeline-tread-plus-john-foley"&gt;subsequent recall of its treadmill&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421329/peloton-api-bug-customer-data-exposed"&gt;potential data leak&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XHNFtg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y58nqXNrFH4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BZYG4U"&gt;US-based manufacturing ventures are a reliable way for tech companies to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241646/apple-tim-cook-gave-the-first-mac-pro-to-trump"&gt;generate positive press&lt;/a&gt;, and they can sometimes struggle to live up to the hype. Recent examples include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;Foxconn’s infamous plant in Wisconsin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20974999/trump-is-lying-about-the-new-apple-factory"&gt;“new” “Apple” factory&lt;/a&gt;, which then-president Donald Trump bragged about, that was neither new, nor operated by Apple. For its part, Peloton is promising 2,000 new jobs coming to a reasonably rural area, but the proof will be in the actual Pelotons rolling out from the Ohio factory, which the company says is planned for 2023. According to &lt;a href="https://www.onepeloton.com/press/articles/peloton-pop-announcement"&gt;its announcement post&lt;/a&gt;, the company is currently working with local and state partners to finalize plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="By8KD2"&gt;The Ohio factory may not be the first producing Peloton equipment in the US: the company purchased fitness equipment maker Precor late last year, which has factories in Washington and North Carolina. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266121/peloton-shipping-delays-earnings-q4-2020"&gt;Peloton reportedly hopes&lt;/a&gt; to start building some equipment in those factories by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.6 now available with new Apple Podcasts subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ynrvr-lLBWkVE-FcWLjMfyREk2g=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334814/bfarsace_201106_4269_002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uFiP3s"&gt;Apple is releasing its latest iOS 14.6 update today, and it’s largely focused on audio improvements. This new OS update will allow Apple Music subscribers to enable lossless audio or Dolby Atmos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;once it’s available next month&lt;/a&gt;, and it also debuts Apple Podcasts subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnw8CA"&gt;Podcasts users can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;subscribe to content&lt;/a&gt; in the app for extra perks like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. Apple is also improving the Podcasts app with the ability to mark all episodes as played, recover old episodes, and remove downloads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6cqHT"&gt;iOS 14.6 includes a number of other quality-of-life improvements. If you’re an AirTag owner, iOS 14.6 includes the option to add an email address as a contact method for when the item tracker is in lost mode. There’s also Apple Card Family sharing, with support for up to five people to share an Apple Card for purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a8fYXO"&gt;As always, this latest version of iOS also includes some fixes and security improvements. Apple has fixed an issue with the Apple Watch not unlocking an iPhone correctly, problems with reminders as blank lines, call blocking extensions not appearing in settings, reduced iPhone performance during startup, and Bluetooth issues during calls.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s refreshed Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 is designed for entry-level laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1CDjFyJGpc1TDqL52SK-GbcLLn4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334701/acastro_210430_1777_semiCon_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q6vVoU"&gt;Qualcomm has announced a second-generation Snapdragon 7c Arm-powered processor that’s designed to be used inside entry-level Windows PCs and Chromebooks. The biggest change to the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 (the official name) appears to be a clock speed bump, which &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16696/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-entrylevel-pc-and-chromebook-refresh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; is a jump from 2.4GHz to 2.55GHz. And like the original Snapdragon 7c, it offers integrated LTE connectivity so you can connect to cellular networks, and Qualcomm promises it will support “multi-day battery life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A9V1Sd"&gt;The first device with the chip is set to arrive “this summer,” &lt;a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/05/24/qualcomm-expands-compute-portfolio-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-compute-platform"&gt;Qualcomm said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;, and Lenovo has already promised to release new devices using the 7c Gen 2 “later this year.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLwf7E"&gt;More chipmakers are increasingly making Arm-based chips, which promise better performance and power efficiency. The first Snapdragon 7c was only used in a handful of Chromebooks, so we’ll have to see if this new chip offers enough to get more device-makers on board, but Lenovo’s commitment to make devices with the chip this year is a promising sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdacqQ"&gt;Qualcomm is also going up against Apple and its powerful M1 chip, which you can now find in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review"&gt;Mac Minis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22440059/apple-imac-m1-2021-24-review"&gt;iMacs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor"&gt;iPad Pros&lt;/a&gt;. Those devices are all more expensive than the type of machine the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 is targeted for, however, and it’s possible Qualcomm’s new chip could bring some of the benefits of Arm-based processors to lower-cost (and non-Apple) devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Florida governor signs law to block ‘deplatforming’ of Florida politicians</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis speaks at a press conference..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JApTClDS6pnTN222tY0lBVll9nI=/0x169:4200x2969/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334687/1231882337.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EKZG3K"&gt;Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill Monday that bars social media companies like Twitter and Facebook from “knowingly” deplatforming politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEBGKq"&gt;The bill, SB 7072, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22413934/florida-bill-restrict-social-media-politicians-twitter-facebook-disney-trump"&gt;was proposed in February&lt;/a&gt;, weeks after former President Donald Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the deadly right-wing riot at the US Capitol. The law bars social media platforms from banning Floridian political candidates and authorizes the Florida Election Commission to impose fines if these candidates were to be deplatformed. The fines range from $250,000 per day for statewide office candidates and $25,000 per day for non-statewide offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMVRQA"&gt;“This will lead to more speech, not less speech,” DeSantis said during a press conference at the Florida International University in Miami Monday. “Because speech that’s inconvenient to the narrative will be protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JiwDeO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Many are already skeptical about the new law’s legality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PZRc1o"&gt;Many are already skeptical about the new law’s legality, with the tech-friendly Chamber of Progress calling it “clearly unconstitutional.” As a state law, the measure could be overturned if courts find it conflicts with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which broadly immunizes platforms from liability for good-faith moderation activity. It could also be subject to a constitutional challenge under the First Amendment, which has been interpreted to broadly prevent government interference to corporate speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpWeRg"&gt;But regardless of its legal status, the measure will help establish DeSantis’ political bona-fides among the anti-tech wing of the Republican Party. For years, Republicans have pressured platforms like Facebook over their content moderation policies, accusing the companies of being biased against conservative speech online. DeSantis’ bill is one of the first major victories for populist Republicans in opposition to the power of Big Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8F2GSU"&gt;Carl Szabo, the vice president and general counsel for NetChoice, a trade group representing large tech companies like Facebook and Amazon, argued that the law could be found to be unconstitutional. “The First Amendment prohibits the government from compelling or controlling speech on private websites,” said Szabo. “If this law could somehow be enforced, it would allow lawful but awful user posts including pornography, violence, and hate speech that will make it harder for families to safely navigate online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzI1sp"&gt;Earlier this month, Facebook’s Oversight Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22320329/facebook-oversight-board-trump-ban-decision"&gt;upheld the platform’s ban&lt;/a&gt; on Trump but called on the company to create new rules on imposing permanent suspensions. Facebook has six months to write this new policy and decide whether Trump should be allowed back on Facebook-owned social media platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRgXTi"&gt;“This session, we took action to ensure that ‘We the People’ — real Floridians across the Sunshine State — are guaranteed protection against the Silicon Valley elites,” DeSantis said. “If Big Tech censors enforce rules inconsistently, to discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology, they will now be held accountable.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZxMp64"&gt;Police in India raided the offices of Twitter India in Delhi and Gurgaon on Monday as part of an investigation into why tweets about a so-called “toolkit” of information about the coronavirus were labeled as manipulated media,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/twitter-india-delhi-police-raid-7328607/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Indian Express&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. An officer told the media outlet that police had sent a notice to Twitter demanding an explanation for the label on a ruling party member’s tweet, and that it was seeking “information Twitter has about the toolkit and why they chose to give the ‘manipulated media’ label.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15Q5Vb"&gt;Twitter declined to comment Monday. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/24/delhi-police-run-by-indias-central-government-raids-twitter-offices-over-manipulated-label/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that there were no Twitter employees in the offices at the time of the raid, which occurred late Monday evening India Standard Time. Journalist Aditya Raj Kaul tweeted that Twitter employees in India are currently working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;

Apparently there is work from home at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TwitterIndia&lt;/a&gt; since March last year. Was this move by Government to send out a message? &lt;a href="https://t.co/aCBfjhb5CC"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aCBfjhb5CC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Aditya Raj Kaul (@AdityaRajKaul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AdityaRajKaul/status/1396846575318495237?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68PiW7"&gt;On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;Indian government sent a notice to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; two days after the social media platform &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1395714092837457931?s=20"&gt;applied the “manipulated media” label&lt;/a&gt; to a tweet by Sambit Patra, of India’s ruling BJP party. Patra said in the tweet, which appears to have been removed, that the opposition party Congress had used a “toolkit” in attempts to undermine the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/india-twitter-politicians-tweets-manipulated/"&gt;government asked Twitter to remove the label&lt;/a&gt; out of “fairness and equity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKkB36"&gt;The BJP party says the Congress party created the toolkit to damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to the &lt;a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-is-the-congress-toolkit-controversy-all-you-need-to-know/articleshow/82761578.cms"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Times of India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but the Congress party claims the version of the toolkit the BJP shared was a falsified version of a research note about an unrelated project. &lt;a href="https://www.altnews.in/covid-toolkit-attributed-to-congress-created-on-forged-letterhead/"&gt;Indian fact-checking organization &lt;em&gt;Alt News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that the images of the so-called “COVID toolkit” that Patra and others tweeted about did have some falsified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmNwcM"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/new-approach-to-synthetic-and-manipulated-media.html"&gt;introduced its manipulated media policy&lt;/a&gt; last February, which applies to media shared on its platform that has been “significantly and deceptively altered or fabricated.” Video clips or images that have been altered to change their meaning or context could get a label, and false content presented as true or content found to be “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm” could be removed entirely under the rules. Twitter applied the label to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296518/twitter-trump-video-manipulated-media-deepfake-carpe-donktum"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/18/trump-tweet-label-video/"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt; by former US President Donald Trump, who has since been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;banned from the platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RDUdx"&gt;India’s government has tried to keep tight control over information on social media concerning the spread of COVID-19. Last month, the government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;ordered Twitter to remove tweets&lt;/a&gt; and told &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook and Instagram to take down posts&lt;/a&gt; that were critical of its handling of the pandemic. And in March, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-threatens-jail-for-facebook-whatsapp-and-twitter-employees-11614964542"&gt;India’s government threatened to jail&lt;/a&gt; Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter employees in the country if they failed to comply with its requests to take down content about protests by farmers. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/india-twitter.html"&gt;Twitter ended up permanently blocking&lt;/a&gt; more than 500 accounts and removing others from being visible within the country following a notice of noncompliance from the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGyO25"&gt;According to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/india"&gt;India reported&lt;/a&gt; 222,315 new cases of COVID-19 and 4,454 new deaths on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new tool will identify skin conditions — what will people do with that information? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsnxvL2Gqo42yZYLNTDn5Asp4X4=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334574/Copy_of_derm___hero_image_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nI94jm"&gt;Google announced last Tuesday that it developed a new artificial intelligence tool to help people &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;identify skin conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Like any other symptom-checking tool, it’ll face questions over how accurately it can perform that task. But experts say it should also be scrutinized for how it influences people’s behavior: does it make them more likely to go to the doctor? Less likely?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znOmzX"&gt;These types of symptom-checking tools — which usually clarify that they can’t diagnose health conditions but can give people a read on what might be wrong — have proliferated over the &lt;a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/351/bmj.h3480"&gt;past decade&lt;/a&gt;. Some have &lt;a href="https://ictandhealth.com/news/symptom-checkers-will-see-you-now-startups-race-to-create-a-perfect-health-concierge/"&gt;millions of users&lt;/a&gt; and are valued at &lt;a href="https://mercomcapital.com/your-md-raises-30-million-for-digital-symptom-checker-app/"&gt;tens of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;. Dozens popped up over the past year to help people check to see if they might have COVID-19 (including one &lt;a href="https://landing.google.com/screener/covid19?source=google"&gt;by Google&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHLoaN"&gt;Despite their growth, there’s little information available about how symptom-checkers change the way people manage their health. It’s not the type of analysis companies usually do before launching a product, says Jac Dinnes, a senior researcher at the University of Birmingham’s Institute of Applied Health Research who has evaluated smartphone apps for skin conditions. They focus on the answers the symptom-checkers give, not the way people respond to those answers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fyOykc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You don’t know what the impact is going to be”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OBv7F2"&gt;“Without actually evaluating the tools as they’re intended to be used, you don’t know what the impact is going to be,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vWdJ15"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filling in a knowledge gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9dcLw"&gt;Google’s dermatology tool is designed to let people upload three photos of a skin issue and answer questions about symptoms. Then, it offers a list of possible conditions that the artificial intelligence-driven system thinks are the best matches. It shows textbook images of the condition and prompts users to then search the condition in Google. Users have the option to save the case to review it later or delete it entirely. The company aims to launch a pilot version &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;later this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irtb1z"&gt;It also may introduce ways for people to continue research on a potential problem outside the tool itself, a Google spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXuvLE"&gt;When developing artificial intelligence tools like the new Google program, researchers tend to evaluate the accuracy of the machine learning program. They want to know exactly how well it can match an unknown thing, like an image of a strange rash someone uploads, with a known problem. Google hasn’t published data on the latest iteration of its dermatology tool, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440754/google-health-ai-skin-condition-model-dermatology"&gt;the company says&lt;/a&gt; it includes an accurate match to a skin problem in the top three suggested conditions 84 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9QXK7"&gt;There’s typically less focus on what users do with that information. This makes it hard to tell if a tool like this could actually meet one of its stated goals: to give people access to information that might take some of the load off dermatologists who are stretched thin all over the world. “There’s no doubt that there’s such a huge demand for dermatologists,” Dinnes says. “There’s a desire to use tools that are perceived as helping the situation, but we don’t actually know if they’re going to help.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="uYJOGP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a desire to use tools that are perceived as helping the situation, but we don’t actually know if they’re going to help.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xvGR2U"&gt;It’s a big gap in our understanding, says Hamish Fraser, an associate professor of medical science at Brown University who studies symptom-checkers. “In addition to the basic problem of whether people can even interpret the systems correctly and use them correctly, there’s also this question about whether people will actually respond to anything that is fed back to them from the system.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5oCcB"&gt;Filling that gap is key as more and more of these tools come onto the market, Fraser says. “There are more and more emerging technologies.” Understanding how they could change people’s behavior is so important because their role in healthcare will likely grow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qo2omm"&gt;“People are already voting with their feet, in terms of using Google and other search engines to check symptoms and look up diseases,” Fraser says. “There’s obviously a need there.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NVZRHA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do people do next? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="RnBfiN"&gt;Ideally, Fraser says, future&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;studies would ask people using a symptom-checker for permission to follow up and ask what they did next or ask for permission to contact their doctor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9RWPf"&gt;“You would start to very quickly get a sense as to whether a random sample of millions of people using it got something from the system that related to what was actually going on, or what their family doctor said, or whether they went to the emergency department,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4K1D3"&gt;One of the &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2757995"&gt;few studies&lt;/a&gt; that have asked some of these questions followed up with around 150,000 people who used a virtual medical chatbot called Buoy Health. Researchers checked how likely people said they were to go to the doctor before using the bot and how likely they were to go to the doctor after they saw what the bot had to say. Around a third of people said they would seek less urgent care — maybe wait to see a primary care doctor rather than go to the emergency room. Only 4 percent said they would take more urgent steps than before they used the chatbot. The rest stayed around the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAcUWq"&gt;It’s only one study, and it evaluates a checker for general medical symptoms, like reproductive health issues and gastrointestinal pain. But the findings were, in some ways, counterintuitive: many doctors &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/05/18/google-dermatology-assist-skin-app/"&gt;worry&lt;/a&gt; that symptom-checkers lead to overuse of the health system and send people to get unnecessary treatment. This seemed to show the opposite, Fraser says. The findings also showed how important accuracy is: diverting people from treatment could be a big problem if done improperly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBENoO"&gt;“If you’ve got something that you’re concerned about on your skin, and an app tells you it’s low risk or it doesn’t think it’s a problem, that could have serious consequences if it delays your decision to go and have a medical consultation,” Dinnes says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ADKOd"&gt;Still, that type of analysis tends to be uncommon. The company behind an existing app for checking skin symptoms, called Aysa, hasn’t yet explicitly surveyed users to find out what steps they took after using the tool. Based on anecdotal feedback, the company thinks many people use the tool as a second opinion to double-check information they got from a doctor, says Art Papier, the chief executive officer of VisualDx, the company behind Aysa. But he doesn’t have quantitative data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FR0EBj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We don’t ask them to come back to the app and tell us what the doctor said.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GZNw87"&gt;“We don’t know if they went somewhere else after,” he says. “We don’t ask them to come back to the app and tell us what the doctor said.” Papier says the company is working to build those types of feedback loops into the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHTT79"&gt;Google has planned follow-up studies for its dermatology tool, including a partnership with Stanford University to test the tool in a health setting. The company will monitor how well the algorithm performs, Lily Peng a physician-scientist and product manager for Google, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The team has not announced any plans to study what people do after they use the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZJNa9"&gt;Understanding the way people tend to use the information from symptom-checkers could help ensure the tools are deployed in a way that will actually improve people’s experience with the healthcare system. Information on what steps groups of people take after using a checker also would give developers and doctors a more complete picture of the stakes of the tools that they’re building. People with the resources to see a specialist might be able to follow up on a concerning rash, Fraser says. “If things deteriorate they’ll probably take action,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnRB4K"&gt;Others without that access might only have the symptom-checker. “That puts a lot of responsibility on us — people who are particularly vulnerable and less likely to get a formal medical opinion may well be relying most on these tools,” he says. “It’s especially important that we do our homework and make sure they’re safe.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRAHKy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This picture of cheese helped send a man to prison for 13 years</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bZO26ruaI5PLi7l1j-2CQrhVoqc=/0x333:1080x1053/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334374/stewart1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Police analyzed the palm and fingerprints in the photo to identify the suspect.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Merseyside Police&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3TwWH"&gt;It’s generally a good idea to be careful about the photos you share online. Share a photo of your vaccination card, for example, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/6/22270400/coronavirus-vaccine-card-selfie-social-media"&gt;you risk revealing your full name and date of birth&lt;/a&gt;, which opens you up to the possibility of identity theft. But you might want to be &lt;em&gt;even more&lt;/em&gt; careful if you’re a drug dealer involved in selling heroin and cocaine. Even an innocent picture of a block of cheese can contain enough personal information to help convict you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0wULb"&gt;We’ve got the &lt;a href="https://www.merseyside.police.uk/news/merseyside/news/2021/may/liverpool-man-latest-to-be-jailed-as-part-of-national-operation-venetic/"&gt;UK’s Merseyside Police&lt;/a&gt; to thank for the worrying revelation, the &lt;a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/block-stilton-cheese-downfall-encrochat-20654184"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Liverpool Echo &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, after they successfully identified drug dealer Carl Stewart (39, of Gem Street, Liverpool) and convicted him of conspiracy to supply cocaine, heroin, MDMA, and ketamine with the help of a simple photo of a wedge of stilton. It’s not clear why he posted the pic of blue cheese, but Stewart has now been sentenced to 13 years and six months in prison after pleading guilty to the charges, which also included transferring criminal property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K6R88g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JAILED |  A man identified through a picture of a block of cheese is the latest to be jailed as part of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpVenetic?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OpVenetic&lt;/a&gt;. Carl Stewart, 39, was sentenced to 13 &amp;amp; a half yrs in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply class A and B drugs.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myagds"&gt;Stewart seems to have made two errors in sharing his cheesy photo. The first is that the photo contained a clear image of his fingerprints and palm, which Merseyside Police were able to analyze and use to identify him. Stewart isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242204/whatsapp-drug-dealer-caught-fingerprints-photo-message-wales-police"&gt;the first criminal&lt;/a&gt; to have been convicted thanks to fingerprints identified from a photo, but it’s yet another reminder that your fingerprints &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/2/11540962/iphone-samsung-fingerprint-duplicate-hack-security"&gt;are far from the top-secret identifiers&lt;/a&gt; we often consider them to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ocSb7"&gt;Second is that he shared the photo on EncroChat, the supposedly encrypted phone system that was compromised by authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311306/encrochat-arrests-criminals-police-hacking-uk-europe-encrypted-chat"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt;, leaving its security with more holes than swiss cheese. Since then, Merseyside Police says authorities have identified around 10,000 of its users in the UK, who are “all involved in coordinating and planning the supply and distribution of drugs and weapons, money laundering and other criminal activity.” A total of 60,000 of its users have been identified worldwide, the police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWrDOO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker’s second-generation Nano II GaN chargers are even smaller than before</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vU5ZqN"&gt;Anker’s GaN (gallium nitride) chargers are some of the best around, offering tiny sizes but powerful charging capabilities. Now, the company is introducing its second-generation GaN-based chargers: the Anker Nano II lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d4r5Lw"&gt;The new Nano II chargers use what Anker calls its “GaN II” technology, the company’s second-generation version of the gallium nitride-based components, which Anker says offer a 20 percent increase in working efficiency,” which translates to less heat and even smaller chargers than before. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="SMbWf2"&gt;Gallium nitride is an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"&gt;increasingly popular replacement&lt;/a&gt; for silicon components in electrical devices, thanks to a wider band gap than silicon. That means it can sustain higher voltages at higher temperatures with faster electrical current than the traditional material. Those properties make it perfect for things like ultra-small chargers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pTpVra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Gallium nitride is the silicon of the future","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051974/gallium-nitride-anker-material-silicon-semiconductor-energy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="B8mUUg"&gt;The original Anker PowerPort Atom PD 1 helped usher in the first wave of GaN chargers when it was first released in 2019, packing enough power to charge a small laptop in a brick the size of Apple’s now-defunct (but laughably underpowered) 5W iPhone bricks. Since then, we’ve seen ultra-small GaN chargers offer even more powerful wattage specs: it’s easy and affordable to get a 65W brick that can power a decent-sized computer that fits in your pocket now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMrzXH"&gt;The new Nano II chargers will come in three models: a 30W model for $29.99, a 45W charger for $35.99, and a 65W for $39.99. All three chargers feature a single USB-C port (with the larger 45W and 65W models also featuring flip-down plugs) and come with Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology for managing charging wattages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGHb1c"&gt;The 30W is the smallest of the bunch, measuring in at 1.24 x 1.20 x 1.49 inches — making it marginally smaller than the original 30W PowerPort Atom PD 1, which is 1.6 x 1.4 x 1.5 inches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PanZaO"&gt;The three chargers are available to preorder from both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Anker-Adapter-Compact-MacBook/dp/B091DS2M8X/ref=sr_1_5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://us.anker.com/pages/ankernanoii"&gt;Anker’s&lt;/a&gt; website, and they will ship in June.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to remove your account from someone else’s Twitter list</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U9AbA_-dJBSbg29m08gKeb6OE9Q=/137x0:763x417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69334265/Twitter-block.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8pabmq"&gt;Twitter lists can be a wonderful resource: they can help you categorize different companies, track what’s happening with your friends or family, follow accounts that you enjoy, or keep up with news sources you like to follow. And being on others’ Twitter lists can help amplify your own tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCfj7W"&gt;However, occasionally, you could find yourself on a Twitter list that you’d rather not be associated with. Perhaps somebody misread one of your tweets and thought that you agreed with a certain point of view — and you don’t. Or it could happen that somebody who disagrees with you puts you on a list in order to target you for harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mWGRwF"&gt;Journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twcarey"&gt;Theresa W. Carey&lt;/a&gt; has suggested that it’s a good idea to check your Twitter account regularly to make sure you’re not on any lists that you’d rather not appear on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fcfd5i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They don’t make it easy to check which lists you’re on. On the “Lists” page, there are 3 little dots in the top right corner. Click/tap on those and you’ll see “Lists I’m On.” Tap that and see if you’re on any lists that you would rather NOT be on. I do that at least weekly. &lt;a href="https://t.co/dE0F4xcZEe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dE0F4xcZEe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Theresa W. Carey (@twcarey) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twcarey/status/1396225791357161474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DON9It"&gt;As Carey explains, this is how it’s possible to check which lists you’re on. (These instructions are for the web version of Twitter.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mZcUfV"&gt;Click on the “Lists” icon to the left of your feed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x7W92J"&gt;You’re now on the Lists page, where you’ll find all of your lists. Click on the three dots in the upper-right corner, and click on “Lists you’re on.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="bx9mS4"&gt;Now you can see which lists you are on; the most recent should be on top.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see which Twitter lists you’re on" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y4H1iPQO_1TTMWo1mUH5_Ia_9a8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535915/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.48.13_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see which Twitter lists you’re on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="itG3GM"&gt;If you find that you are on a list you’d rather not be on, you can get off that list by blocking (temporarily or permanently) the person who created the list. Here’s how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="32Gjb5"&gt;Use the method above to find the list you don’t want to be on. Select the account name of the list creator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEUhcQ"&gt;You’ll now be on that person’s profile page. Click on the three dots to the right of their image, select “Block &amp;lt;person’s account&amp;gt;” and confirm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you block an account (temporarily or permanently), you’ll be removed from its lists" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_ySXPjoMwud8MrjLlfEj4sIow8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22535905/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.48.38_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you block an account (temporarily or permanently), you’ll be removed from its lists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="clrt3M"&gt;You’ll now be blocking that account and will have removed your name from any lists created using that account &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="i9yYtp"&gt;If you don’t want to actually block that person permanently, you can then immediately click “Unblock” (which you’ll see if you hover your cursor over the button that says “Blocked”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can unblock the account by hovering over the “Blocked” button (which will then say “Unblock”)." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRy1JQa3ttpKcpVLiGWijCZrbn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22536416/Screen_Shot_2021_05_24_at_9.49.25_AM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can unblock the account by hovering over the “Blocked” button (which will then say “Unblock”).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FcpZLJ"&gt;Of course, if you haven’t permanently blocked that account, they could always put you back on their list — or you may show up on somebody else’s. So it’s a good idea to check every once in a while and see which lists your Twitter account is on.&lt;/p&gt;
