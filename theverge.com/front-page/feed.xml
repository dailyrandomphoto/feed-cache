    <title>Jack Dorsey says Square has a new Bitcoin business named TBD</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yGA1yN"&gt;Jack Dorsey, CEO of both Twitter and Square, is enough of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147574/twitter-ceo-bitcoin-jack-dorsey-square-interview-currency-10-years"&gt;fan of cryptocurrency &lt;/a&gt;that Square’s push into the area won’t stop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22569309/square-hardware-wallet-bitcoin-jack-dorsey"&gt;at releasing a hardware wallet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the company is creating a new business, to go with existing units like Tidal and Cash App, which is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yC2Lf3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Like our new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; hardware wallet, we’re going to do this completely in the open. Open roadmap, open development, and open source. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@brockm&lt;/a&gt; is leading and building this team, and we have some ideas around the initial platform primitives we want to build.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1415765943385563139?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dHSWHW"&gt;What does that mean exactly? Is the new business called TBD, or is the name “to be determined” at a later date? In the words of at least one editor of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “I absolutely do not know what he is talking about.” When contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for Square declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hc25hx"&gt;What we do know comes mostly from the unit’s new leader Mike Brock, who confidently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795489954361347"&gt;tweeted out several names of TBD’s founding team&lt;/a&gt;, and says he’s “super excited to return to the world of open source.” Further updates on exactly what TBD is doing should come via Twitter and GitHub accounts. But exactly when those updates might arrive is, well, TBD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sea4Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; said, we're going to be biasing towards being open and transparent. So we'll be sharing a lot more about our plans in the coming days and weeks. We're also going to be thinking of ways to include the community in our planning. So stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Brock (@brockm) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brockm/status/1415795491879624705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>England footballer calls out weak response from social platforms after online abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New Digital Mural Of The Three Black Footballers Racially Abused After England Lost The Euro’s Final Is Unveiled" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JvcslaJxs1CDh0KmJAxTrWZ7NbI=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588368/1328717139.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mural in support of England footballers Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka was unveiled in Manchester. The three were targeted with racist abuse online after the Euro 2020 final. | Photo by Charlotte Tattersall/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rS8mPr"&gt;Bukayo Saka, a player on England’s national football team said in an &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRWkU6mLLlJ/"&gt;Instagram post Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that social media platforms did not do enough to prevent the racist abuse he and his teammates were subjected to after the team’s loss to Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4814z4"&gt;“To the social media platforms &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/instagram/"&gt;@instagram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/twitter/"&gt;@twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/facebook/"&gt;@facebook&lt;/a&gt; I don’t want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me Marcus and Jadon have received this week,” Saka wrote. “I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vfqd8X"&gt;Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, and Saka, who are Black, were among England’s players to participate in a penalty shootout to decide the winner of the UEFA Euro 2020 championship match on July 11th. England ultimately lost, and the players ‘social media accounts, including Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram, were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;flooded with racist comments and messages&lt;/a&gt; not long after the game ended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIrMbW"&gt;Instagram head Adam Mosseri told a BBC reporter on Wednesday that Instagram had mistakenly marked some of the comments aimed at the players that used monkey emojis as benign “which they are absolutely not.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vxUMk2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have technology to try and prioritize reports, and we were mistakenly marking some of these as benign comments, which they are absolutely not. The issue has since been addressed, and the publication has all of this context.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Mosseri   (@mosseri) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1415335234300690433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzdNQJ"&gt;Twitter said Monday it had removed more than 1,000 tweets and suspended some users for violating its policies against harassment and hateful content; Facebook said it had suggested using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394611/instagram-tool-filter-abusive-direct-messages-harassment"&gt;Instagram’s hidden words tool&lt;/a&gt; to remove the objectionable comments from being visible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5mLbl"&gt;But as Saka wrote in his post, he knew the hateful posts were coming, yet Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and other social platforms typically seem to be in reaction mode when incidents like this occur, rather than taking steps to prevent abuse from happening in the first place. It was unfortunately not hard to predict that there would be racist reactions after the end of the match: Throughout the UEFA tournament, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/13/england-players-take-knee-wembley-euro-2020-boos-applause"&gt;fans at Wembley Stadium had booed&lt;/a&gt; their home team when players kneeled before games as an anti-racism protest. England &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/03/gareth-southgate-england-fans-boos-taking-knee"&gt;manager Gareth Southgate said last month&lt;/a&gt; that fans booing England players kneeling before a friendly match against Austria felt like it was critical of the team’s Black players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xdbxv"&gt;It shouldn’t be up to the targets of abuse to push for better responses from social platforms, especially when everyone except the platforms themselves seem to know what’s coming. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How does Valve’s Steam Deck compare to the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZNfDx1Hfn0R18XRJLqtT9tC0jiE=/214x0:2305x1394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588345/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.18.17_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRbo7Y"&gt;Valve’s surprising &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;new Steam Deck has been officially announced&lt;/a&gt;, promising to let players take their whole Steam library of games on the go. But how does the handheld compare to other major consoles on the market, like the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series X / S, and the PlayStation 5?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvE5q7"&gt;First off, let’s look at the Steam Deck’s specs. It’s powered by an AMD APU with a quad-core / eight-thread Zen 2 CPU and an AMD RDNA 2 GPU with 8 compute units, alongside 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOIFE4"&gt;There are three models available: one with 64GB of eMMC storage for $399, one with a 256GB NVMe SSD for $529, and a top-of-the-line model with 512GB of high-speed NVMe SSD storage for $649. While the base eMMC storage configuration could potentially mean slower game installs and load times, Valve promises that “there is no in-game difference in frame rates or graphics quality” among the three models. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfugIKRSIDj-WqZfG7PlsaV3eEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719626/Image_from_iOS.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRF0ft"&gt;The most obvious comparison for the Steam Deck is, of course, Nintendo’s Switch — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;particularly the upcoming OLED model&lt;/a&gt; — which offers a similar handheld configuration, screen size, and design. Both devices feature 720p touchscreen displays, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMcabs"&gt;Of the two, the Switch is almost certainly the less powerful device: it features Nvidia’s Tegra X1 chipset, an Arm-based processor that’s over four years old, compared to the Steam Deck’s AMD Zen 2 CPU and next-gen RDNA 2 GPU, architectures that also appear in the PS5 and Xbox Series X. The Steam Deck has also been shown off handling games that the Switch simply can’t, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; (which is only available as a cloud-streamed option on Nintendo’s handheld.) And other showcased games, like &lt;em&gt;Jedi: Fallen Order&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;No Man’s Sky&lt;/em&gt;, have never been available in a portable form factor before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="O83yQ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More powerful than the Switch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RCwnGv"&gt;But given that the two handhelds are closest together in form factor and price, it’s still worth looking at them side by side — especially considering that even with the gap in performance, they’re far closer to each other than the dramatically more powerful Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNRBql"&gt;Unlike the Switch, the Steam Deck swaps removable controllers for some additional input methods: there’s a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;Steam Controller-style&lt;/a&gt; trackpads on either side of the display, in addition to the thumbsticks, and four extra buttons on the back of the device that serve as paddle-esque additional inputs. It also offers Bluetooth audio for connecting a pair of wireless headphones, something the Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;rather frustratingly lacks&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Wk23IJhvhbjSZWI6Lt289cXMzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719724/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.19.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V72Gi8"&gt;The Switch does win out in battery life, though, with 4.5 to 9 hours quoted for the Switch OLED, versus 2 to 8 hours on the Steam Deck, with &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/steam-deck-valve-faq-big-questions-answered"&gt;Valve telling &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you can realistically expect 4 hours of &lt;em&gt;Portal 2&lt;/em&gt; at 720p and 60 frames per second. The Switch is also much lighter than Valve’s portable, weighing in at 0.93 pounds to the Steam Deck’s 1.47-pound weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XDXo7X"&gt;Choosing between the $349 OLED Switch and the $399 Steam Deck will largely come down to preference, though: do you prefer Nintendo’s level of polish and lineup of exclusive games, or Valve’s rougher around the edges — but more powerful — option, with its extensive PC gaming library? (The Steam Deck also has other advantages: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578879/valve-steam-deck-handheld-pc-windows-support"&gt;since it’s a full-fledged PC&lt;/a&gt;, you can technically install Windows and leverage it as a portable Xbox Game Pass machine, install the Epic Game Store, and use it for streaming services like Stadia or Luna.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9PtgtJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The PS5 and Xbox Series X win out in virtually every metric&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v2Ohna"&gt;Compared to the lineup of next-gen consoles, like the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, the Steam Deck fares considerably worse: its processor is simply no match for the beefier chips in the latest consoles from Sony or Microsoft, and its GPU is markedly less powerful than even the Xbox Series S, with less than half the graphics cores of Microsoft’s weakest next-gen console. Despite the fact that the Steam Deck uses the same RDNA 2 GPU architecture, it’s just not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4eIQ3"&gt;As seen in the chart below, the PS5 and next-gen Xbox consoles win out in almost every metric on which you care to compare them: more cores, faster CPU clock rates, dramatically more compute units, faster GPU clock rates, and more teraflops of raw GPU power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPuwmJ"&gt;And while that may feel like an unfair comparison, it’s worth considering that the Steam Deck — which ranges in price from $399 to $649 — is priced more in the same ballpark as those more premium consoles than the Switch ($199 to $349).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pUnV8t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10653941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oYhF3"&gt;A more apt comparison, at least when it comes to predicting the Steam Deck’s approximate power, may be that of the last console generation: at 1.6 teraflops, it slots in neatly between the Xbox One S (1.4 teraflops) and the PS4 (1.8 teraflops) in terms of raw graphical prowess. The Steam Deck does use a more modern RDNA 2 architecture, though, so it’s hard to directly compare the two on specs alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztQAm0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees say the company is cracking down on remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kxNmtVq_JC4s00f9NPfwg0RmLZs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69588204/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="74nfy4"&gt;Apple employees say it’s harder than ever to get remote work requests approved after the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;rolled out a new hybrid model&lt;/a&gt; that will require people to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Some employees say they will quit if Apple doesn’t change its stance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNMKlT"&gt;While Apple historically discouraged employees from working from home, there were one-off exceptions to the rule, and some teams were more lenient than others. Now, employees say that even those exceptions are being denied. In a company Slack channel where employees advocate for remote work, roughly 10 people said they were resigning due to the hybrid work policy or knew others who’d been forced to quit. The Slack channel currently has more than 6,000 members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hkEz0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560586/apple-hybrid-work-internal-survey-tim-cook"&gt;survey on remote work&lt;/a&gt; conducted by employees in June, 36.7 percent of respondents said they were worried they’d have to leave Apple due to the lack of flexibility (1,735 people answered the question).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TBg79W"&gt;The return-to-work plan has already been a flashpoint at Apple, where employees wrote a letter in June asking Apple CEO Tim Cook to reevaluate the hybrid model. Deirdre O’Brien, senior vice president of retail and people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22556615/apple-response-hybrid-work-model-employee-letter-remote"&gt;sent a video in response&lt;/a&gt; saying that in-person collaboration was “essential” and noting the company would not be backing away from its current approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="M1xHzX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I will be out of a job in September”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HielYm"&gt;While Apple’s corporate employees certainly have more flexibility than the retail staff, some say it’s out of step with other big tech companies in Silicon Valley. Twitter and Facebook have already announced a permanent work-from-home policy, and Apple employees say they’ve been flooded with recruiting messages from other tech organizations eyeing a potential opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ld1Cht"&gt;One employee said they were currently on an Americans with Disabilities Act accommodation that allowed them to work from home, but were told that accommodation would be denied when the company went back to the office. “I will be out of a job in September,” they wrote in Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jt11t"&gt;Apple typically gives employees 30 days to find a new job within the company if their current team denies a medical accommodation. But one worker said in Slack that there weren’t any open remote positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBKN7"&gt;Some employees say they were told only people with documented medical conditions would be approved for permanent remote work. But the form that Apple employees use to request such an accommodation asks them to release their medical records to the company, which made some people uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oU6QlI"&gt;Now, employees are discussing how to get Apple’s attention. Some suggested writing another letter to reiterate their concerns, while others have discussed talking to lawyers about possible legal action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToWXQ8"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato announces new Stream Deck the same day Valve announces new Steam Deck</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Er4refyJyMUgG4zfZktVZjou9E=/8x0:2660x1768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587965/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_1.39.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elgato’s new Stream Deck, which is different from Valve’s Steam Deck.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oVk4r"&gt;Elgato’s Stream Deck is a popular tool for live-streamers, letting them set shortcuts and controls they can access with the push of a button, and the company announced a new model on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;the Stream Deck MK. 2&lt;/a&gt;. This version brings a host of welcome improvements, including a detachable stand, interchangeable faceplates, and a removable USB-C cable. You can &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/stream-deck-mk2"&gt;order it right now on Elgato’s website for $149.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKi4m"&gt;While the Stream Deck MK. 2 does seem like a nice upgrade, it was announced on perhaps the worst possible day. Just a few hours ago, Valve made a huge splash by revealing its new handheld gaming console called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Preowc"&gt;While they’re entirely different products, there’s sure to be some confusion about the names “Stream Deck” versus “Steam Deck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cT7qrx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;amazing that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@valvesoftware&lt;/a&gt; announced steam deck just hours before &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elgato&lt;/a&gt; announced their new stream deck. i'm gettin eyestrain just THINKIN about these press releases &lt;a href="https://t.co/DJKSCxT6UM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DJKSCxT6UM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tim rogers (@108) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/108/status/1415756755192193027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3kSLJy"&gt;Alongside the &lt;s&gt;Steam&lt;/s&gt; Stream Deck, Elgato also revealed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22568273/elgato-facecam-webcam-price-features-streaming-1080p"&gt;streamer-friendly Elgato Facecam&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415751930471608320"&gt;Wave XLR USB audio interface&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elgato/status/1415752902694498305"&gt;new mic arms&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google adds option to instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R68153-XRoa5BoWJIJh8sqfNMEw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587843/acastro_210104_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YDRprS"&gt;Google is launching a new privacy feature for search that lets you instantly delete your last 15 minutes of search history on mobile, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/search/new-privacy-tool-search/"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. The new option &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/safety-security/our-work-keep-you-safe/"&gt;was first revealed&lt;/a&gt; alongside several other search and Chrome improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/google-io"&gt;at I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt; and is now rolling out to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19UyiI"&gt;The option to delete your last 15 minutes of search history is currently only available in Google’s iOS app and is headed to Android later this year. On desktop, your options for deleting searches are limited to setting your history to auto-delete every three, 18, or 36 months (18 months is the default for new accounts), or deleting searches by hand. You can see what the new option looks like in the iOS app below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5dwpayVPtzvPEZDPR9OTuI1UmdE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720317/QUICK_DELETE.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deleting the last 15 minutes of your Google search life is as simple as tapping one button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X3tpLT"&gt;Google says it only tracks your search history to “personalize” your experience when the “Web and App Activity” setting is enabled. Adding a way to instantly delete your history is great for your peace of mind, but it also means you can get some of the benefits the people who’ve taken the time to mess with their settings receive, without doing the extra work. Think of it as an emergency “oh no” button for terrible, embarrassing, or just plain private searches. If you’d rather just secure your searches from prying, non-Google eyes rather than delete them, Google also offers the option &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452122/google-my-activity-page-password-privacy-verification-web-and-app-history"&gt;to password protect your search history&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Old memes are Bill Murray, dodging them is Tilda Swinton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“The French Dispatch” Photocall - The 74th Annual Cannes Film Festival" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XnSXcUNROPbPrOwH-4IAN408Rm4=/0x166:4681x3287/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587829/1328503506.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the photos from this Cannes photo shoot has been widely memed. Please make it stop. | Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PVY1MR"&gt;Twitter said Thursday it was hearing from users who were seeing too many topic suggestions in their home timelines and was moving to remedy the situation. “We’re fixing that now, and will continue to improve Topics and find ways to show you the very best of Twitter. Things you want to see, that is,” its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1415757630836981764"&gt;Support account tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. To its credit, Twitter has seemed more responsive to users’ complaints — or their lack of interest — of late; in addition to Thursday’s topics announcement, Twitter said this week it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;kill off Fleets&lt;/a&gt;, its ephemeral disappearing tweets that apparently no one was using. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZqvgt"&gt;But instead of showing us more things we want to see, I think Twitter should lean into taking away things we don’t want. I have a suggestion that I think most of the internet will be able to get behind — and we know the internet never collectively agrees on anything, so hear me out here: a way to block memes that are past their expiration date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tihjzw"&gt;This request is inspired by the meme-ified photo of Wes Anderson, Timothée Chalamet, Tilda Swinton, and Bill Murray from the Cannes Film Festival. It’s meant to promote their movie &lt;em&gt;The French Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;, but since we (the internet) have to beat every funny thing into the ground, then dig it up and beat it some more, a version of that meme is now everywhere. Murray represents the “older” end of the spectrum, Swinton is the “cool” one, etc. I’m not going to over-explain it to you. If you know, you know, and explaining memes is probably &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/style/cheugy.html"&gt;cheugy&lt;/a&gt;. (I don’t know, I am Gen X.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m9CYRI"&gt; Example: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eg4XTE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;TechCrunch, The Information, The Verge, Techmeme? &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL"&gt;https://t.co/ZefkeyZqxL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— alex (@alex) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alex/status/1415373066658516993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S87JQs"&gt;I’ll refrain from debating the accuracy of the above (it’s correct), but you get the idea. In all seriousness, a “block image” feature would be extremely useful, and not just to reduce the number of annoying memes in our timelines. Twitter has a way to &lt;a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/437099/how-to-unblock-potentially-sensitive-content-on-twitter/#:~:text=To%20disable%20the%20warning%2C%20head,disable%20the%20warning%20for%20tweets."&gt;block “sensitive media,”&lt;/a&gt; but it would be great if there were a toggle for specific images — maybe ones that are potentially triggering to a given user but not necessarily widely objectionable — rather than a blanket block-all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEm1cX"&gt;For the time being, you’ll just have to continue to grit your teeth through everyone’s “clever” takes on this worn-out meme; it’s a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22Bill%20Murray%22&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;trending topic&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter at the moment. But it’s also beginning to make the rounds on Facebook, which should be the agreed-upon sign that the meme is officially over and we need something new and shiny to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video game handhelds didn’t die after all</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxIdBhI7qTxOCWCkFlUaWksuYKY=/375x0:4425x2700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587743/Steam_Deck_coop.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbZPFL"&gt;When the beloved PlayStation Vita eventually died out, many blamed the rise of mobile gaming. “I think the PS Vita, while ahead of its time in many ways ... launched at exactly the wrong time in terms of market opportunity,” former Sony vice president of marketing John Koller &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22545198/playstation-vita-10-year-anniversary-sony-handheld"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about going up against smartphones. But despite the Vita’s demise, dedicated gaming handhelds didn’t die out — in fact, the space is arguably as vibrant as ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wl0Okd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;Valve just announced the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, a chunky portable PC that looks like a Sega Game Gear from a parallel universe. It’s designed to let players take their Steam library of PC games on the go. Just a few hours later, preorders opened for the latest iteration of the Nintendo Switch, one that doesn’t change much aside from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a bigger, brighter OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a kickstand that doesn’t suck&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Panic is planning to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/5/22/18628360/playdate-panic-teenage-engineering-qwop-katamari"&gt;the oddball Playdate this year&lt;/a&gt;, and Analogue is building &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/16/20906665/analogue-pocket-game-boy-handheld-release-date-price"&gt;possibly the most beautiful Game Boy ever&lt;/a&gt; with the Pocket, also slated for a 2021 launch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CeMwG_ePFdMNsdP7u7vnsihAghY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719912/3_Analogue_Pocket_All_Angles.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Analogue’s Pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gLkJm9"&gt;Nintendo showed that there’s still a market for this kind of device. Nearly five years ago, the company completely changed its approach to hardware with a machine that blurred the lines between a handheld and a home console, and the Switch has since become a massive hit, moving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;more than 84 million units&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps most interesting, though, is that the two hardware revisions since the Switch debuted in 2017 have both been focused on portable play. First, there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;the handheld-only Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, and now the OLED version; a better screen doesn’t matter much if you’re playing the Switch docked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V7BZtX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The DS was Nintendo at its best and weirdest","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIjXG2"&gt;The Steam Deck follows a similar approach. It’s basically a cheap PC with a screen so you can play on the go, but which can also connect to an external monitor or TV if you want. It’s kind of like a Switch without Nintendo games. Given Valve’s history with building hardware like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2019/11/26/20984123/valve-steam-controller-discontinued-sale-price"&gt;the Steam Controller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17190394/valve-steam-machines-steamos-section-hidden-pc-gaming-living-room"&gt;living room-focused Steam Machines&lt;/a&gt;, chances are the Steam Deck won’t be the breakout hit the Switch was. It could usher in a new style of PC gaming hardware, or, far more likely, it could end up as a beloved niche. But its sheer existence further proves that there’s a market here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wzQAH6"&gt;Because smartphone gaming didn’t kill the portable console.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Mobile gaming continues to be a massive success; EA isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood"&gt;throwing around&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile"&gt;billions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; for nothing. But, for the most part, the kinds of games that have proven to be successful on mobile aren’t the ones you would buy a device specifically to play. Free-to-play has completely upended the space, covering virtually every genre and major release, from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Candy Crush Saga&lt;/em&gt;. At this point, unless your game is called &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, it’s probably not going to sell. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22370217/apple-arcade-fantasian-nba2k-wonderbox-classics-netflix"&gt;Apple Arcade is an attempt&lt;/a&gt; to bring things back to those early, exciting days of premium iPhone gaming, but dedicated handhelds seem better suited to filling that niche.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WDR6e3V0BcEnw5hzccFO3AfxVE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719930/Playdate_model_shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Panic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Playdate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y4h490"&gt;What’s most exciting about this handheld renaissance is how different each machine is. The Switch is so incredibly Nintendo, an underpowered device that’s still a must-own because of &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;. The Steam Deck is a PC on the go. Analogue’s first foray into portables — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18513025/analogue-console-clones-gaming-history-preservation-code-hardware"&gt;the company makes some great retro consoles&lt;/a&gt; — solves a very important problem, namely letting people play original Game Boy cartridges on a beautiful, modern screen. The Playdate is the strangest of all: a little yellow box with a crank handle you can use to play black-and-white games designed by the likes of Keita Takahashi and Zach Gage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0fMGu"&gt;In some ways, 2021 looks a lot like the handheld markets of years past. You have Nintendo leading the way at the top, and lots of other companies — some big, some small — trying to carve out their own niche. In the past, those failed experiments have turned into much-loved devices. I still keep a Vita, Game Boy Micro, and Neo Geo Pocket Color in a desk drawer because I can’t let go. That could very well happen again here, as none of these machines are a guaranteed success. Years from now, a Playdate might fill an empty space in that drawer. But one thing &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; for certain: I can’t wait to travel again with a messenger bag full of games.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Self-driving startup Aurora will raise $2 billion in SPAC merger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6M6UtTJ_OVjlGpEOz8gl6217hO0=/342x0:2364x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587551/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_2.45.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vmJI52"&gt;Self-driving technology startup Aurora, which was founded by the former head of Google’s autonomous vehicle program, is the latest company to announce that it’s going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC). The deal will give Aurora about $2 billion in new cash when it closes, which will help the startup in its quest to become a provider of self-driving hardware and software to companies in the trucking and ride-hailing industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwgA16"&gt;Aurora is merging with a SPAC called Reinvent Technology Partners Y that’s already listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange, and is run by LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus, and investor Michael Thompson). That trio is also in the process of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298957/joby-aviation-public-evtol-electric-aircraft-spac-hoffman"&gt;taking electric aircraft startup Joby Aviation public&lt;/a&gt; with another Reinvent SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BAL0qG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aurora’s co-founders came from Google, Tesla, and Uber &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UiEzX5"&gt;Founded in 2017, Aurora has a short history. But its executives have deep and diverse experience with autonomous vehicles. Chris Urmson, who architected Google’s self-driving car project before it was spun off as Waymo, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/12/10/13905292/google-car-chris-urmson-new-company"&gt;started plotting Aurora in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. He eventually recruited Sterling Anderson, who was the head of Tesla’s Autopilot team until &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teslas-push-to-build-a-self-driving-car-sparks-dissent-among-its-engineers-1503593742"&gt;he reportedly resigned over disagreements&lt;/a&gt; about Elon Musk’s push to advertise that the company’s cars would be capable of “full self-driving.” Urmson also tapped Drew Bagnell as a co-founder. Bagnell had been a self-driving engineer at Uber after the tech company poached him from Carnegie Mellon (as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2015/5/19/8622831/uber-self-driving-cars-carnegie-mellon-poached"&gt;much larger raiding of the university’s vaunted robotics division&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfHLA5"&gt;Since then, Aurora has been developing the hardware and software required to allow vehicles to drive themselves — a package of technologies that it calls the Aurora Driver. The startup already has deals in place with companies like Uber, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274640/toyota-aurora-denso-self-driving-car-robotaxi"&gt;Toyota&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358005/volvo-aurora-autonomous-truck-partnership"&gt;Volvo&lt;/a&gt; to use the Aurora Driver. Aurora also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;bought Uber’s entire self-driving division at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ZtNNBw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10368711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WMZr9M"&gt;The deal with the Reinvent SPAC will value the self-driving startup at $11 billion and is expected to close in the second half of 2021. Just under $1 billion will come from the SPAC itself, while the other $1 billion will come from a consortium of investors that includes Uber, Volvo, and PACCAR (a trucking company that Aurora also has a deal with), as well as T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, Sequoia Capital, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PDz6Gq"&gt;Aurora said in &lt;a href="https://aurora.tech/ir"&gt;presentations and filings made public Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that it plans to have trucking customers start using the Aurora Driver without humans behind the wheel in late 2023, and in ride-hailing vehicles in late 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0EeJR"&gt;Aurora expects to lose money until at least 2027, which is why the SPAC merger is crucial. The next two to three years are going to be very expensive for Aurora as it continues to prove out its technology to the point that it can start making money selling it to other companies. Aurora lost $214 million across 2020 (with $179 million of that going to research and development), and that cash burn has only accelerated since, as the startup lost $189 million in the first quarter of 2021 alone (with $159 million spent on R&amp;amp;D in the quarter). Aurora has pitched investors that putting money into a technology this expensive is worth it, though, because the startup believes the autonomous vehicle industry will be dominated by very few players. In one slide, it compares the self-driving industry to the digital ad duopoly held by Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUcCGg"&gt;The deal announced Thursday is just the latest in an increasingly long line of SPAC mergers in the wider transportation industry, which is resulting in huge injections of cash into startups that need the money. Faraday Future is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq next week in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22247942/faraday-future-spac-merger-public-psac-property-solutions-nasdaq"&gt;a deal that will net the EV startup $1 billion in fresh cash&lt;/a&gt;. Lucid Motors will pull in an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22268085/lucid-motors-spac-merger-public-nyse-cciv-deal-air-sedan"&gt;astonishing $4.4 billion&lt;/a&gt; when it goes public soon after. LIDAR companies like Luminar, Velodyne, and AEye have also gone public by merging with SPACs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qao4N"&gt;Not all the deals have gone well. Some startups have struggled with the scrutiny that comes with being publicly-traded, like Lordstown Motors, whose CEO already resigned following an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;investigation into false statements he made about preorders&lt;/a&gt;. Velodyne is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453138/velodyne-david-hall-spac-letter-board-removal"&gt;locked in a legal battle with its own founder&lt;/a&gt;, who was ousted from the board of directors following the merger. EV startups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336751/lordstown-motors-sec-inquiry-review-hindenburg-investigation-orders"&gt;Lordstown Motors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454738/nikola-cult-founder-worship-trevor-milton-general-motors"&gt;Nikola&lt;/a&gt; are all facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;federal investigations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOc2ha"&gt;At the very least, Aurora’s founders can’t sell shares for four years and some of the SPAC’s leaders agreed to similar terms, in a show of commitment to seeing this through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvWCNI"&gt;Self-driving startups had not jumped into the SPAC fray until now. But that may be changing. In addition to Aurora, fellow autonomous vehicle startup &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-08/ford-backed-argo-said-to-choose-citigroup-jpmorgan-to-go-public?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Argo AI is reportedly in talks to go public in a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldBdqB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s payment system extends to online retailers in August</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5X6hhojPhhf7Xerp3yCrb9-T7xo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69587398/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRCmCK"&gt;Online shoppers will eventually see another option listed next to the usual payment methods, now that &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website"&gt;Facebook Pay will expand beyond the company’s own platforms&lt;/a&gt;. Not long after credit card companies dropped out of its Libra cryptocurrency project, Facebook launched its payments system for use across the main site, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zrK06wjN52nBRSvy5rAEt5-QIW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22719620/218332548_1237235380047988_2622834128320440862_1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook Pay is coming to online shopping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ThDddn"&gt;Now, just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/16/17358034/google-pay-how-to-mobile-payments-android-iphone"&gt;Google’s stored cards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/19/22541286/paypal-raise-seller-fees-transactions-online-payments"&gt;PayPal integrations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/17970466/amazon-prime-shopping-behavior-streaming-alexa-minimum-wage"&gt;Amazon Pay&lt;/a&gt;, and others, Facebook Pay is opening itself up for use in transactions with participating retailers. Shopify merchants are first in line to add the system on their sites, with others to follow after it launches in August. Interested merchants &lt;a href="https://pay.facebook.com/business/"&gt;can sign up here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJ5tDH"&gt;Of course, this isn’t just an easier way for retailers to get paid with cards customers have already stored in their Facebook profiles, it’s also a way to get even more data into Facebook. The announcement points to &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/11/privacy-matters-facebook-pay/"&gt;this privacy page&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook Pay, which clearly states:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hb5wZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this impact data collection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmA7jD"&gt;As with previous payment options on our apps, when you make payments with Facebook Pay, we’ll collect information about the purchase such as the payment method, transaction date, billing, shipping and contact details. We designed Facebook Pay to securely store and encrypt your card and bank account numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6rATa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does this impact the ads I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9B870"&gt;As with our other products, the actions you take with Facebook Pay can be used for purposes such as to deliver you more relevant content and ads, to provide customer support and to promote safety and integrity (e.g., to investigate violations of our payments policies). For example, if you buy a baseball glove on Facebook Marketplace, you might see an ad for a baseball bat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZmEUj"&gt;The card and bank account numbers you provide will not be used to personalize your experience or inform the ads you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RUlD4g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
