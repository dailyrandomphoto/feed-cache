    <title>eBay introduces an interactive 3D sneaker viewer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Yq3sKmcF7PN03tYntIzmSKD0pg=/217x0:2479x1508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241557/ebay_3d_viewing_sneaker.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-debuts-new-3d-true-view-feature-for-sneakers/" target="_blank"&gt;eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pTtpFd"&gt;eBay now lets you get a 360-degree look at some of the sneakers it has for sale, all thanks to its handy new 3D viewing tool, called eBay 3D true view. In a post on &lt;a href="https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-debuts-new-3d-true-view-feature-for-sneakers/"&gt;eBay’s website&lt;/a&gt;, the e-commerce platform said that the feature will let sellers add interactive images of their sneakers to listings. It’s partnering with Unity, a platform that can be used for real-time 3D modeling, to pilot the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MX8w09"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scans of sneakers will be uploaded to the cloud and processed using AI&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxD6R6"&gt;Starting this month, eBay says that select sneaker sellers will get the chance to try out the feature, however, the 3D images will only be viewable from its iOS or Android app. To use it, sellers will have to use a proprietary app to take a video of their sneakers from all angles. From there, that data is uploaded to the cloud and processed “using AI methodology” (that eBay didn’t elaborate about) resulting in what eBay says is a “photorealistic” 3D recreation of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSrwcj"&gt;While the feature is only available to a limited number of sellers currently, eBay plans to expand it in 2022. Any sneaker sellers interested in using the 3D feature can sign up for the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Febay.com%2F3Dwaitlist&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822678%2Febay-sneaker-viewer-3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;waitlist&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is live on the site right now, and if you’re on mobile, you can start viewing sneakers in 3D &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2Ffashion%2Fsneakers-in-3d-113021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F7%2F22822678%2Febay-sneaker-viewer-3d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from here&lt;/a&gt;. It appears that not every listing has the 3D viewer right now, though, so you might have to tap a few different ones before you find a listing that uses 3D true view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tq9wgv"&gt;eBay continues to dive headfirst into the sneaker market. In October, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514028/ebay-sneaker-con-authentication-100-guarantee-fake-counterfeit-limited-edition"&gt;rolled out a sneaker authentication service&lt;/a&gt; to help combat counterfeiters and later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808373/ebay-sneaker-con-acquisition"&gt;bought out the third-party sneaker authentication&lt;/a&gt; company that it was using, called Sneaker Con. eBay isn’t the first online marketplace to implement 3D views of sneakers, however: &lt;a href="https://stockx.pvxt.net/c/482924/530344/9060?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstockx.com%2Fnews%2F360-degree-images-are-live%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;StockX has been offering 360-degree images&lt;/a&gt; of sneakers since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon starts rolling out Smart Home Dashboard and other new features to Fire TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wfSkURHYX9IcxEQXKqBn9r-kIQE=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241439/Smart_Home_Dashboard.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwJInB"&gt;Amazon is today beginning to roll out new features and functionality to its lineup of Fire TV streaming devices and the recently released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22785648/amazon-fire-tv-omni-review-alexa"&gt;Fire TV Omni&lt;/a&gt; and 4-Series televisions. At the top of the pile of new tricks is a Smart Home Dashboard that looks similar to what’s already available on the company’s Fire tablets and Echo Show smart displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QPH45"&gt;The dashboard, available in the US and Canada, offers quick access and on / off toggles for connected lights, plugs, and switches that are linked to your Alexa system. Smart cameras get their own row in the dashboard, complete with a thumbnail of their perspective — though not a live view until you actually click into them. Previously, you could control your smart home gadgets with voice commands through the Fire TV’s Alexa Voice Remote, but it’s always nice to have an actual interface on the screen for this stuff. Samsung offers a TV dashboard for its SmartThings platform, and the Apple TV has a semblance of one via Control Center. Amazon says additional features like smart home groups and smart thermostats will be added to the dashboard next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2M59Y"&gt;On the subject of Alexa, Amazon’s also adding what it’s calling an Alexa Shortcut Panel that appears on-screen when you press the remote’s Alexa button. This will get you to “smart home controls, weather, news, and your video library.” The company says this feature will be “broadly” rolled out across Fire TV hardware in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS0zo0"&gt;Amazon is also beefing up the audio side of its Fire TV experience. The company is expanding the ability to use Echo speakers (like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Echo Studio if you’re feeling fancy&lt;/a&gt;) as speakers and bringing that feature to the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K Max&lt;/a&gt; and the Fire TV Omni / 4-Series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdSRW4"&gt;On the TVs, Alexa Home Theater supports audio both from streaming apps and connected devices, but Amazon says the same even holds true for the Stick 4K Max so long as it’s plugged into the eARC port on your TV. Sound from other inputs like a game console will be routed through the Alexa Home Theater setup. That’s a first and something the other Fire TV streamers aren’t capable of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ijHUX5"&gt;With Fire TV Omni Series and 4-Series televisions, audio will output when streaming on Fire TV and across any compatible device that’s connected, including cable boxes, gaming consoles, and antenna sources. Fire TV Stick 4K Max can now do the same, so long as it’s plugged into your TV’s HDMI eARC port, which means you can broadcast audio to Echo speakers, even when you’re enjoying content on inputs other than Fire TV. Set-up instructions are &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.amazon.com_gp_help_customer_display.html-3FnodeId-3DGDFMQWDYT5MCAEA4&amp;amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=IGt1VQsTZCfLQH1674IFDQUVoZpbOko0Qdd91-cp1Z0&amp;amp;m=hf8VoHnI165iA-RYtjZ1ldA9Zw_uguHmzto-pqAECfNwbXz1cPRmgRxFbZK8SGNL&amp;amp;s=kzxDwDAZX7elx_fsJo-X7R0l6xGcxbRQUUIlk8D8bH8&amp;amp;e="&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Rgd5pq"&gt;After promising to support Apple’s AirPlay 2 on its Fire TV Omni and 4-Series TVs, that feature is also set to roll out soon — though AirPlay integration is sadly still nowhere to be found on standalone Fire TV streaming devices. And last, Amazon again confirms that Zoom is on its way to the Omni TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tocWqb"&gt;Owners of the first self-branded Amazon TVs will be able to plug a camera into the USB port for videoconferencing. In the coming weeks, you will be able to place and receive Zoom meetings from the biggest screen in your home. After downloading the Zoom app through Fire TV, simply plug a compatible 720p–1080p webcam into the USB port and say, “Alexa, find Zoom” to get set up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EtDgn"&gt;Fire TV owners can expect all of these new features to arrive in the “coming weeks,” according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker’s early access period didn’t provide much access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AsqN_S-AKlRX5kQLGZGAeisYMio=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241384/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_32.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kUJcXc"&gt;On December 3rd, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;’s latest expansion launched its early access period, allowing those who preordered the game the opportunity to play &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; in advance of its December 7th release date. Or at least that’s how it was supposed to work. For lots of players, the early-access experience was an exercise in patience. With game servers at max capacity and login queues containing upward of 4,000–8,000 players, if you were in early access and actually got access, you were one of the privileged few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5jyap"&gt;Square Enix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22809776/ff14-endwalker-square-enix-log-in-queues-extended-wait-times"&gt;warned players this would happen&lt;/a&gt;. Days before early access began, it published a notice detailing what the company had done to prepare for the inevitable congestion, along with tips to mitigate wait times. Still, after a summer of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; consistently breaking player records, hourslong queues, disconnections, and the player dissatisfaction that accompanies those events seemed inevitable. During peak hours, wait times were as long as six to eight hours on popular servers. And even if a server didn’t have a massive number of people waiting to get in, aspiring Endwalkers could still experience the dreaded “2002 error” which disconnects players from the lobby, forcing them to reenter the queue, sometimes preserving a player’s place in the queue but often times not. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAi7JnBnefLAoCFjl71uLKurO_M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070938/queue.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The (comparatively light) queue for my world, Zalera, a low-population server. Typical queues before Endwalker early access were 20–60 players long.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fIDBNI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; game director Naoki Yoshida published several posts over the weekend apologizing for the exceedingly long wait times, explaining this early access period has seen the most simultaneous logins in the game’s eight-year history. In addition to outlining everything the development team was doing to increase stability and ease congestion, Yoshida announced that Square Enix would provide players with seven days of free game time. He also shared some insight on the busiest times, so players can maximize their playing time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NqhJCz"&gt;Though the congestion status may vary for each logical data center, I’d like to share information regarding the peak hours of congestion we’ve currently observed as of December 5.&lt;br&gt;North American Data Center: 12:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (PST) / 20:00 to 6:00 (GMT)&lt;br&gt;European Data Center: 3:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. (PST) / 11:00 to 23:00 (GMT)&lt;br&gt;Japan Data Center: 1:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. (PST) / 9:00 to 15:00 (GMT)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj2GgS"&gt;On the &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; subreddit, players were generally understanding of the extended wait times but expressed dismay over other bugs, errors, and player behavior that exacerbated the already frustrating experience. One of the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/r8ylaj/dear_se_if_youre_going_to_have_a_login_queue_can/"&gt;most upvoted threads for this week&lt;/a&gt; was a post that explained players were fine with waiting but were upset that even patient waiting wouldn’t guarantee them a chance to play with the specter of the “2002 error” looming large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Hg6J1"&gt;“6k+ long queues wouldn’t be so bad if I knew I was getting in at the end of it,” user CodeMagick wrote. “Instead, you get a lobby error every 5-10 minutes and have no idea if your spot in queue is saved or not when you log back in.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWFVAb"&gt;Others on the subreddit were annoyed by players who seemingly tried to circumvent the game’s inactive timeout feature or those who appeared to just take up space without meaningfully engaging with the game. &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; is designed to disconnect players who are inactive for 30 minutes. Creative players would try to bypass this forced logout by auto-attacking training dummies or exploiting the auto-run feature. In &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;, there’s also a popular tradition for players to gather in hub worlds and use the dance emote for hours at a time. While being a funny example of &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; culture, the action was also thought to circumvent a timeout. In one of his weekend blog posts, Yoshida reassured players that regardless of using emotes or other methods, players who are inactive even in those states after 30 minutes are booted from the server. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Syl2ooZ_QxkSBky3Q-gdT3B12TE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070996/limsalominsa.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, dancing in Limsa Lominsa will not save you from auto timeout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tLMZQo"&gt;Congestion is also affecting key in-game features. As of the time of publication, all servers with the exception of Malboro do not allow the creation of new characters, meaning all the players excited by the addition of male viera as a playable race will have to wait a little longer before they can dress them up as pretty maids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzIpnZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/4269a50a754b4f83a99b49341324153ef4405c13"&gt;In his address to fans&lt;/a&gt;, Yoshida expressed remorse that the queues are what they are and that the best solution to this problem — the addition of new servers — would be long in coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fdtaE"&gt;“On the one hand, following the explosive rise in players coming to &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt; beginning in spring 2021, we spent over half a year scrambling to address the need to add new [servers],” Yoshida said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6kZYc"&gt;“However, due to policies surrounding COVID-19, which have had an effect on the entire world, even now we have been unable to procure the required hardware for adding new [servers] ... Given the current situation, we anticipate that it may take several months or more to add new [servers].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDmiCK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; launched today for the PlayStation and PC. If you log in now, the queues are pretty light.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Power companies commit to building nationwide EV charging network </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Orange County Register Archive" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aaqfaqoUCzojqXc-1APVrLHXrXQ=/0x19:4062x2727/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241319/1034907296.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;City leaders and representatives from NRG eVgo unveil three new electric vehicle charging stations at the public parking structure in Hermosa Beach, CA on Friday, September 05, 2014. | Photo by Scott Varley/Digital First Media/Torrance Daily Breeze via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1UZ02"&gt;Over 50 utilities across the US have come together to speed up the build-out of electric vehicle charging stations along the nation’s highways. The new National Electric Highway Coalition was announced today by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), an association of investor-owned power companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qc2JVT"&gt;Together, the companies aim to “fill charging infrastructure gaps along major travel corridors,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.eei.org/issuesandpolicy/Documents/EV_NEHC_Fact_Sheet.pdf"&gt;fact sheet&lt;/a&gt;. Each utility that’s a member of the coalition must commit “in good faith” to create an EV fast charging network across its service territory “using any approach they see fit” by the end of 2023. The US will need more than 100,000 fast charging ports for the 22 million electric vehicles expected to traverse American roadways by 2030, according to the EEI.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bO1XaC"&gt;For now, the roughly &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/06/07/todays-electric-vehicle-market-slow-growth-in-u-s-faster-in-china-europe/"&gt;1.8 million electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; registered in the US can juice up at just &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;amp;country=US"&gt;46,000 public charging stations&lt;/a&gt; in the country. Just around 5,600 of those, according to the Department of Energy, are DC fast charging stations that can get an EV battery to 80 percent charged in under an under hour. Easier access to faster charging stations, in particular, could help drive greater EV adoption among &lt;a href="https://www.utilitydive.com/spons/from-range-anxiety-to-charger-anxiety-evolving-challenges-for-ev-adoption/588063/"&gt;wary customers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jsJH0X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Things are on track to change quickly&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hQ5wBn"&gt;Things are on track to change quickly, however, because of new policies set in motion by the Biden administration. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22610501/biden-2030-ev-goal-trump-emissions-rollback"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt;, Joe Biden signed an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/08/05/executive-order-on-strengthening-american-leadership-in-clean-cars-and-trucks/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; setting a goal for half of all new passenger vehicles sold in the US by 2030 be electric or hybrid cars.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;To meet rising needs for EV charging, the recently passed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/#electricvehicle"&gt;bipartisan infrastructure law&lt;/a&gt; includes $7.5 billion to invest in a national network of EV chargers. That could benefit utilities that choose to partner with states on putting those dollars to work, according to Kellen Schefter, director of electric transportation at EEI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZPvfi"&gt;“We’re excited about the additional funding that will be coming from the federal government to support public charging, we think all of that is needed and more,” Schefter says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVGYL0"&gt;On top of permitting delays, the process of connecting new charging stations to the grid has &lt;a href="https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/ev-charging/ev-charger-installations-in-california-are-bogged-down-by-local-permitting"&gt;slowed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/27/evgo-is-behind-on-charger-installations-for-gm-grounds-for-agreement-termination/"&gt;down&lt;/a&gt; the rollout of EV charging infrastructure in the past. But utilities have the advantage of already knowing what the grid’s existing capacity is at any potential new location for a charging station. That intel could help the coalition smooth out some of the road blocks that other initiatives have faced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKZE0g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZhHXHk"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; opened its newsletter with an article on Vice President Kamala Harris’ &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2021/12/06/kamala-harris-is-bluetooth-phobic-495343"&gt;aversion to using Bluetooth headphones&lt;/a&gt;. The VP was “Bluetooth-phobic,” the story claimed, “wary” of her AirPods and cautious with her technology use to an extent former aides described as “a bit paranoid.” Proof could be seen in her televised appearances: wires dangling from her ears in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K00Zx8apeg"&gt;an interview with MSNBC’s Joy Reid&lt;/a&gt; or clutched in her hand &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1325126733482385409"&gt;during the famous “We did it, Joe” call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PjqI9Y"&gt;But for a high-profile public official, this is a lot more reasonable than you might think. As security researchers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1468044270099742723"&gt;were quick to point out&lt;/a&gt;, Bluetooth has a number of well-documented vulnerabilities that could be exploited if a bad actor wanted to hack, say, the second most powerful person in the US government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v5aG27"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The CVE Program lists 459 current and historic vulnerabilities involving Bluetooth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T50pSW"&gt;Some of these attacks come down to the basic mechanics of how the Bluetooth protocol works. With Bluetooth switched on, a phone, laptop or other smart device is constantly broadcasting a signal that can be detected by other devices in range — which provides an unnecessary vector for attack that can easily be eliminated by simply keeping Bluetooth off. Assuming Bluetooth is enabled, a smartphone user generally gets a prompt from any unknown device trying to connect. But in certain cases this can be skirted, as with one exploit that &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-devices-vulnerable-short-range-bluetooth-exploit"&gt;impersonates a trusted Bluetooth device&lt;/a&gt; already known to the user in order to connect to the phone, at which point the attacker can request or send data via Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89rDim"&gt;(The complexity of this attack makes it unlikely to affect regular people, but for a figure like the VP — who is undeniably a high-value target for foreign surveillance attempts — there’s a non-zero chance of falling victim. It also affects both Android and Apple devices, the latter of which Harris appears to use.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e1WTrC"&gt;Other less severe Bluetooth attacks would let an attacker crash devices through denial of service, essentially overwhelming a phone with connection requests until the processor is unable to respond. Again, such attacks have previously affected both Android &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/05/18/apples_bluetooth_flaws/"&gt;and Apple devices&lt;/a&gt;, although iPhones are considered to have a more secure implementation of Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pAkehy"&gt;In total, the CVE Program, which tracks cybersecurity vulnerabilities, lists &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=bluetooth"&gt;459 current and historic vulnerabilities that mention Bluetooth&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Kamala Harris is right to be wary. There’s a simple way to mitigate all of these attacks — disabling Bluetooth, sticking to wired headphones — but doing so means swimming against the technological current, and maybe looking like you can’t afford AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7SBsWo"&gt;Still, Harris’ justified distaste for Bluetooth is a win for anyone who’s been met with skepticism for suggesting that hey, perhaps they &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to carry around a ball of tangled headphone wires instead of connecting wirelessly via a &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/history-bluetooth-explained-846345/"&gt;decades-old protocol&lt;/a&gt;. If anyone should be shunning the latest technology in favor of the secure option, it’s the vice president.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alleged Bitcoin inventor trial ends without a real Satoshi standing up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z0ELMK2fJrQ0XaJhi-yUulopDxk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241273/acastro_170726_1777_0007_v6.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rexIL1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/miami-jury-rules-in-favor-of-craig-wright-bitcoin-claimed-inventor.html"&gt;A jury has ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Craig Wright, a man who claims to have invented Bitcoin, won’t have to give up half of his supposed stash of crypto — a stash valued at over $50 billion. The court case has generated a lot of buzz in the Bitcoin community because he would have had to transfer those Bitcoins if the court had ordered him to, and that’s something only the real Satoshi can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnTC3G"&gt;If the name Satoshi Nakamoto rings a bell, it’s because that name shows up on the original whitepaper &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf"&gt;that described how Bitcoin would work&lt;/a&gt;. While Satoshi is a hallowed name in Bitcoin lore (it’s also used as a way to denominate the smallest unit of the currency), Nakamoto’s identity has never been proven — we don’t even know if it was one person or a group of people. While Wright has often repeated the claim that he’s Satoshi, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/16/why-are-we-still-debating-whether-craig-wright-is-satoshi/"&gt;many experts agree&lt;/a&gt; that he hasn’t provided any evidence to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dzmit5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to prove that a pseudonymous currency belongs to a pseudonymous person&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ugZVnu"&gt;Proving whether a pseudonymous currency belongs to a pseudonymous person is... &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/09/01/value-of-legacy-hunting-down-satoshi-bitcoin"&gt;difficult, to say the least&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; amassed a stash estimated at somewhere between 750K and 1.1 million Bitcoin early on, and it’s thought that only the inventor of Bitcoin could have done such a thing. The coins were some of the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;mined on the Bitcoin blockchain&lt;/a&gt; when it was first invented, back when mining could be done on a home computer rather than using specialized equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2S8raw"&gt;It’s these Bitcoin that were at the heart of the case, which started in 2018 when Wright was sued by a deceased former colleague’s relatives. Those relatives actually agreed that Wright was involved in the creation of Bitcoin but claimed Wright wasn’t the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; one — arguing that a man named Dave Kleiman helped Wright invent the cryptocurrency and that the estate was therefore entitled to half of the Satoshi stash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GApAVt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eyes were on the trial to see if Wright would be called to absolutely prove he has the Satoshi million&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W4dltn"&gt;The court case garnered so much attention because, again, much of the Bitcoin community feels absolutely certain that Wright didn’t create the cryptocurrency — and there was the tantalizing possibility that the court might make Wright &lt;a href="https://protos.com/nakamoto-bitcoin-stash-probably-lost-forever-craig-wright-ira-kleiman-trial/"&gt;actually prove that he owned the coins&lt;/a&gt; during the trial or that he’d have to cash them (and similarly prove ownership) if he was ordered by the state to pay out half of them to Kleiman’s family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZflRAt"&gt;While the trial was an absolute rollercoaster — the judge more or less &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/judge-blasts-intentionally-false-testimony-by-supposed-bitcoin-creator/"&gt;called Wright a liar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/judge-slams-craig-wright-for-forged-documents-and-perjured-testimony"&gt;accused him of trying to use forged documents as evidence&lt;/a&gt; — we didn’t get any moments where Wright was asked to prove without a doubt that he was Nakamoto. Wright claims the trial proved he invented Bitcoin, but &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-06/self-described-bitcoin-creator-must-pay-100-million-in-lawsuit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; writes&lt;/a&gt;, the “yearslong litigation in Florida has done little to quiet the skeptics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHeThY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/126475/craig-wright-incredibly-relieved-after-jury-orders-him-to-pay-100-million-in-billion-dollar-bitcoin-lawsuit"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury wasn’t asked to determine whether Wright was actually Nakamoto. Instead, its job was to determine whether Wright and Kleiman had a business relationship that would entitle the Kleiman estate to any fortune Wright may have made &lt;em&gt;if &lt;/em&gt;he actually did invent Bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6bNdtB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Wright still owes $100 million, in fiat instead of crypto&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2byax3"&gt;The story isn’t quite over yet, though — Wright’s &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/miami-jury-rules-in-favor-of-craig-wright-bitcoin-claimed-inventor.html"&gt;been ordered by the jury&lt;/a&gt; to pay $100 million to W&amp;amp;K Info Defense Research, a company Wright started with Kleiman (the jury says he breached the LLC’s intellectual property rights). Coming up with $100 million is no small task, so if we see a stack of Bitcoin (in the neighborhood of 2,000 coins at today’s rates) move from the addresses widely attributed to Nakamoto, it could prove what the courts didn’t. Craig has also &lt;a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-bitcoin-trial-defendant-wins-dispute-over-50b-in-bitcoin/2635479/"&gt;reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that he’ll donate most of his Bitcoin fortune to charity now that he’s won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7RXlh"&gt;While many in the crypto community wouldn’t bet even a single Satoshi on that happening, it’s almost impossible to imagine what would happen to the price of Bitcoin if it did. In May 2020, someone moved 50 of the 2009-vintage Bitcoin that Wright claimed were his, subsequently &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/did-satoshi-just-move-craig-wrights-bitcoins"&gt;causing a minor market meltdown&lt;/a&gt; that knocked almost $6.5 billion off the BTC market cap. Those coins &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/20/50-btc-just-moved-for-first-time-since-2009-but-it-doesnt-look-like-satoshi/"&gt;probably weren’t even Satoshi’s&lt;/a&gt;, and yet, their transfer had that much of an effect — imagine if some of the 1.1 million BTC stash started moving or, worse, being sold en masse. Whether it went up or down, watching the stock ticker would be &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZHjRQjbHrE"&gt;bananas&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Amazon server outage is causing problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Amazon Web Services logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVu4i0c_YWVLUdA-WvFOOWrbvps=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240006/1230840274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="lI8pyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s internal apps went down, too, cutting off some delivery drivers and stalling warehouse robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;While some affected services that rely on AWS have been restored, the internet is still a bit slower and more unsteady than usual. The most important app impacted by the outage might be the ones that Amazon employees use. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/07/amazon-web-services-outage-causes-issues-at-disney-netflix-coinbase.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; points out Reddit posts from Amazon Flex, warehouse, and delivery workers who say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822736/amazon-delivery-van-atoz-app-warehouse-outage-aws"&gt;the apps that keep track of packages, tell them where to go, and generally keep your items on time went down, too&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLyUbN"&gt;There have been reports of outages for Disney Plus and Netflix streaming, as well as games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt; We’ve also noticed some problems accessing &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and other Amazon products like the Alexa AI assistant, Kindle ebooks, Amazon Music, or Ring security cameras. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; list of services with spikes in their outage reports runs off nearly any recognizable name: Tinder, Roku, Coinbase, both Cash App and Venmo, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERNiN"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29473630"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb226w/aws_outage/"&gt;network admins&lt;/a&gt; everywhere about errors connecting to Amazon’s instances and the AWS Management Console that controls their access to the servers. Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;official status page&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with messages confirming the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjgLO8"&gt;[11:26 AM PST] We are seeing impact to multiple AWS APIs in the US-EAST-1 Region. This issue is also affecting some of our monitoring and incident response tooling, which is delaying our ability to provide updates. Services impacted include: EC2, Connect, DynamoDB, Glue, Athena, Timestream, and Chime and other AWS Services in US-EAST-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYGg42"&gt;The root cause of this issue is an impairment of several network devices in the US-EAST-1 Region. We are pursuing multiple mitigation paths in parallel, and have seen some signs of recovery, but we do not have an ETA for full recovery at this time. Root logins for consoles in all AWS regions are affected by this issue, however customers can login to consoles other than US-EAST-1 by using an IAM role for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKq2j"&gt;It appears that the problems are focused on the US-EAST-1 AWS region hosted in Virginia, so users elsewhere may not see as many issues, and even if you’re affected, it could manifest as slightly slower loading while the network reroutes your requests somewhere else. Contacted for comment, Amazon pointed to the updates on its status page, which indicate the company is “actively working towards recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlT80z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 3:41PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about impacts for warehouse and delivery workers, and most recent status message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram makes it easy for teens to find drugs, report finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dpw48HuPlhOHgHfgG-gB5ZCfNfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70241240/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HHAdk"&gt;Instagram’s algorithms recommend drug dealers’ accounts to minor users, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/xanax-ecstasy-and-opioids-instagram-offers-drug-pipeline-kids"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Tech Transparency Project. The platform also suggests drug-related hashtags, the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehthwu"&gt;In the report, published Tuesday, the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) created seven fake accounts for teen users aged 13, 14, 15, and 17. Instagram did not stop those accounts from searching for drug-related content. In one case, the platform auto-filled results when a user started typing “buyxanax” into the search bar. One suggested account was a Xanax dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcoFt9"&gt;After following the account of a Xanax dealer, a fake minor user got a direct message “with a menu of products, prices, and shipping options,” the report found. A fake minor account that followed an Instagram dealer got suggestions to follow an account selling Adderall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlHsCS"&gt;“I would say Instagram is one of the worst places for exposure to this kind of content,” Tim Mackey, a professor at the University of California, San Diego and founder of S-3, a company that tracks illegal drug sales online, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-pushes-drug-content-teens-rcna7751"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FwC3Q"&gt;Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Instagram parent company Meta, said in a statement &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/instagram-pushes-drug-content-teens-rcna7751"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the platform prohibits drug sales. “We’ll continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITxm7S"&gt;The report also found that Instagram’s guardrails against drug-related content aren’t working well. The platform bans many drug-related hashtags, like #mdma, but when the fake minor users tried to search that hashtag, Instagram suggested alternates — like #mollymdma. Otway told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt; that the company will review hashtags to check for policy violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KenlU1"&gt;The report comes during a period of renewed scrutiny of how Instagram and Facebook affect the mental and physical health of its adolescent and teen users. A group of academic researchers published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820675/open-letter-meta-mental-health-research"&gt;an open letter&lt;/a&gt; Monday calling for Meta to be more transparent about its research on the mental health of its young users. Congress &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;held hearings&lt;/a&gt; on the platforms in October after reports in T&lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; highlighted concerns that Instagram could harm the mental health of young users, particularly teenage girls. During those hearings, Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-testimony-platform-trust/"&gt;pointed to another TTP report&lt;/a&gt;, which found that Facebook approved ads promoting drug use and anorexia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQxFEN"&gt;Instagram chief Adam Mosseri is set to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/24/22800901/instagram-chief-adam-mosseri-testify-congress-facebook-meta-zuckerberg"&gt;testify before Congress Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; at a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/12/protecting-kids-online-instagram-and-reforms-for-young-users"&gt;hearing titled&lt;/a&gt; “Protecting Kids Online: Instagram and Reforms for Young Users.” &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hVywrG"&gt;Yesterday, NASA announced its newest class of astronauts: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820265/nasa-new-astronaut-candidates-artemis-generation-announcement"&gt;10 new candidates who will train to fly to space&lt;/a&gt; with the agency over the next two years. The group included plenty of qualified individuals with backgrounds in the military, as well some with more unique professions. One of the candidates was most recently a flight surgeon at SpaceX, while another has worked as a drilling engineer on remote rigs in the Arctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeuIZ5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke briefly with three of the newest astronaut candidates to get a better understanding of their backgrounds and what inspired them to pursue becoming an astronaut. Learn more about the newest members of NASA who could fly to deep space one day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4i6l1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;These interviews have been edited for brevity and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="sql4gH"&gt;Anil Menon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vUmEFM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anil is a medical doctor and Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force, who worked as the first flight surgeon for SpaceX. He was also a flight surgeon for NASA, and is a practicing emergency medicine doctor with experience as a first responder during natural disasters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWZDxeUjPxsMlHpyO5D8aTh87kQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070458/astronaut_candidate_anil_menon.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BMLpTR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a really rich background in medical science. So did you always want to be a doctor? And did you ever think that your experience could translate to the space world one day?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5cRV"&gt;Yeah, I wanted to be both. I had an early dream of being an astronaut. I saw this movie called &lt;em&gt;The Dream is Alive &lt;/em&gt;at the Omni Theater in Minnesota. It was an IMAX movie and there were astronauts in space — just enthralled by a job that could also entail adventure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6mGcSc"&gt;But I also got into medicine. I broke my arms in high school; my mom got hurt and wound up at the County Medical Center, and I wanted to be a doctor. It just helped move me to figure out a way to help people. I didn’t know how to make the paths converge, but I was inspired by some early astronauts. I knew there was one named Scott Parazynski, an ER doctor and an astronaut, and he inspired me to go into medicine and see how I could make that into space medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ke3swt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“One job opened up at SpaceX, and I was lucky and fortunate to get that job.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="710Au9"&gt;Since then, I worked through school, and then found myself working at NASA as a flight surgeon with 20 other doctors. So it wasn’t a big field, and it was hard to find. One job opened up at SpaceX, and I was lucky and fortunate to get that job. But it was just one job. What was really cool was to take that, and at SpaceX, to build a medical student rotation where students could get interested in space at that commercial partner and then to get residents and fellows. Over the past three years, I’ve now been able to work with hundreds of people who have had jobs of all sorts — paramedics, nurse practitioners — in commercial space supporting NASA. So now this is a huge field that I feel is at an inflection point and about to just really take off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PJxv9W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You also practiced wilderness medicine. I’d love to hear more about that. And do you feel like that helped to prepare you for space medicine eventually?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGq102"&gt;It’s medicine in a unique environment without all the resources at your standard ER. So I am an ER doctor, but I take wilderness medicine to Haiti or Nepal or the Mount Everest base camp. You have what you have right there. You take it to the space station, or to [future] Moon missions. It’ll be a lot more limited than what we have on the ground. And so I think there’s a huge amount of overlap there, and a huge need for development and research in these fields, because the better we can get at that, the healthier we’ll be both off the Earth and on the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQ8nol"&gt;I got deployed to Afghanistan and to take care of people in remote areas in 2009. I learned from just practicing medicine on the back of a helicopter, and it’s not too dissimilar from what I’ll be doing in the future space ship. Though I think some of the learning that we have at NASA and space medicine translates back to those kind of military, Wounded Warrior rescue missions, translates back to wilderness medicine, maybe taking care of people via telemedicine and rural parts of America, Antarctica or different countries. There’s a lot of cross pollination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCaB6r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having worked on a SpaceX vehicle, would you want to fly on a SpaceX vehicle as an astronaut moving forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHsBXd"&gt;I would be happy to fly on any. But I would love to fly on a SpaceX vehicle as well. I know the people and the engineers who designed that vehicle, and I know how safe it is. I know how just incredibly well designed it is, and so I have the utmost confidence in them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7wBbSK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“as a NASA astronaut, I’d be open to any of the commercial partners.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jXvATq"&gt;But as a NASA astronaut, I’d be open to any of the commercial partners, because like I said they do such a good job of sharing that safety culture and knowledge with everybody. And it’s great that there’s choices. There’s so many different ways to get to space out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quNDdj"&gt;Jack Hathaway&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JB3T5x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jack Hathaway is a commander in the U.S. Navy with more than 2,500 hours of flight experience, piloting more than 30 different types of aircraft, according to NASA. He recently served as a subject matter expert for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the Pentagon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vdz0ODn8FGSURmu7BhbRIheOZz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070463/astronaut_candidate_jack_hathaway.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hYJQs6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have plenty of experience as a naval aviator. I’d love to know when you caught the bug to become a pilot and fly.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFZkuq"&gt;I mean, I can’t even tell you, I was so young. It’s probably seven or eight seconds after I was born, I was ready to become a pilot. Really, as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to do it. I took some flying lessons as a kid, and as I started to learn about the different types of flying jobs available, I just kind of matched with the Navy — like culture of the Navy, the flying that they do. It just kind of made sense to me. So that was kind of it for me once I figured out that that could be a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToUaYU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you know that you always wanted to go to space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4sTbW"&gt;Go into space has been a dream since I was a little kid. Flying is definitely what I wanted to do, but the opportunity to go to space, also from a young age, was something that I was excited about. I used to watch the Shuttle and I was like, ‘Man, you can fly to space and then fly back from space. That sounds like something that’s pretty cool.’ So I’ve been excited about it. It’s kind of a budding environment. And it’s been in the back of my head since a kid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BsCg9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you moved forward with your career, did you always make those choices with the idea that maybe one day you could translate them into becoming an astronaut?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12bsLQ"&gt;I got some great advice when I when I was a young officer in the Navy: Don’t pick your next job based on what you think other people will want you to do or what you think will be career enhancing. Pick your next job based on what makes you happy and that it’s something that you want to do. So in some ways, I was always cognizant of the fact that the Naval Academy, jet pilot and test pilot school, all those things were on a track to become an astronaut. For me, while I was cognizant of that fact, I also I wanted to do all those things just in and of themselves at the time too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqyUHa"&gt;But I really never lost lost sight of the fact that becoming an astronaut someday would be pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hJuZf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve also flown 39 combat missions. How would describe that shaping your experience in terms of your piloting and how you think that might translate to being an astronaut someday?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynNsBP"&gt;Most naval aviators today that have been on deployment in the last five or 10 or 15 years have done some sort of combat mission in Afghanistan or over Iraq. So it’s pretty common in the F-18 community to find pilots that have flown combat missions. So I’m not sort of abnormal at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uLTOBV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I really never lost lost sight of the fact that becoming an astronaut someday would be pretty awesome.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hjfcOK"&gt;I would say that the Navy does a lot of training, and NASA does a lot of training. So in that sense, we’re very similar. The Navy does a full set up workups to get ready to go on a deployment. We do all sorts of training pipelines to develop pilots from junior guys that are just showing up, to learn how to fly by themselves, to fly with other aircraft, to fly with larger formations. We train ourselves through a robust process to be good at what we do, since we’re trying to support the American taxpayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T562Wz"&gt;And I think that mindset translates really well to NASA, because NASA does extensive training. All the details are worked out beforehand, so we’re as prepared as humanly possible to do the mission that we like to do, to handle emergencies that pop up, work together as a team. Because it’s not just about accomplishing a specific mission, but doing it in the context of a large team, where we need lots of different people, different perspectives, different roles on the team to accomplish that mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bV4QGM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I saw that you were aboard the USS Truman when you got the call about becoming an astronaut. Tell me what it was like to get that news while at sea?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBZxxy"&gt;I missed the call, because we didn’t have a lot of connectivity. So I ended up getting an email from the chief of the astronaut office that said, ‘Hey, man, you missed a phone call. Please give me a call.’ So I furiously tried to get an outside line. It took me a few minutes, but I finally got through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC8kBw"&gt;I will say that it was awesome to get that phone call out at sea, surrounded by my second family. Those men and women, both the officers and enlisted, like they’re like brothers and sisters to me. They were all so excited for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ItsjMf"&gt;Deniz Burnham&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r3TNWD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deniz Burnham is a drilling engineer based in Alaska, as well as lieutenant in the U.S. Navy. She continues to serve in the Navy reserves and has spend the last decade working in the energy sector, with experience living on oil rigs in the Arctic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/enD8oLiG15TKCZM2XbbLKtMzMzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070465/astronaut_candidate_deniz_burnham.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FeqjUi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I read that you were part of a military family growing up and that you moved around a lot as a kid. Where all did you live?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cqhSbK"&gt;Both my parents were actually in the military, and so I was born at Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. And my father got orders to Nebraska shortly after I was born. So I’ve lived in Turkey, Nebraska, Florida, Georgia, California. And that was just childhood moving around. And of course, because I work in oil and gas, that’s kind of taken all the rest of my moving around. So I’ve lived in Alaska, Canada, Ohio, Wyoming, Texas, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJ8WIi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you’ve been all over. Have you enjoyed exploring the world that way? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VA089q"&gt;Oh, absolutely. From a young age, it forces you to be flexible, right? It makes you learn how to adapt. You have to go to new schools, sometimes in the middle of the year. So it’s kind of up to you to try and make friends, play sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxAKEZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did your interest in space began? Was that an early dream, or did it come later?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIE3sG"&gt;It was actually an early dream. My grandfather, he was born in 1927. So he had a big love of two things: He loved bicycles and telescopes. And he shared his love of telescopes with me, thankfully. So he liked amateur astronomy and getting to see Mars and Saturn’s rings just in your own backyard. It really just touched my heart differently. We would have these really beautiful deep conversations, just about space. And, I also was a NASA intern as well, so I’ve always kind of had that desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vQqfg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about getting into engineering, specifically in the energy sector. What prompted you to pursue that field?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qq7VMI"&gt;I studied chemical engineering at UCSD. And my first job after college was actually in the Arctic, on the rigs up there as a field engineer. And it was very challenging, very fast paced. You have to make these real-time decisions that can be very critical. So I’m very grateful for the experiences that I had, working in those fast-paced operational environments, because that’s ultimately what I feel like I can apply towards just furthering NASA’s mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ef7pU2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These oil rigs sound like very remote places. I’m curious what that kind of lifestyle was like? And do you think that’s a good way to prep for going into space someday?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rQmqt"&gt;They are definitely very remote locations in extreme climates. It’s one of the things I’ll never forget, first stepping foot off the plane, landing in the Arctic. never seen that type of weather before. Just seeing the rig for the first time too — very complicated systems. You’re working in small crews. Everybody has to live together. So I think all these things are very applicable towards the kind of skill set that teaches you how to be adaptable, focus on teamwork, putting the team before yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5WzkGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I want to go with, ‘Hey, you know what, it’s okay to train an oil driller to be an astronaut.’”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="chUPRq"&gt;But it also goes to show too, as you hear [the astronauts’] different stories, that there’s no one set path. And I hope that inspires people to follow what they’re passionate about and stay the course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zM4Rg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where were you when you got the phone call from NASA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4iZSju"&gt;I do my navy drills in Alameda in Northern California. And so I had to go for that drill weekend, for my Navy Reserve commitments. And I was actually at my mom’s house. It was pretty early on the West Coast. Working in oil and gas, getting a call from a Houston area code, it’s not abnormal for me. So I just kind of look at it, and I’m thinking, ‘Well, maybe.’ But at the same time, it could be anybody just from work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5ft6c"&gt;So when I heard the chief astronaut officers’ voice, I was holding my breath. And then of course, he asked, ‘Hey are you still interested in working with us at NASA?’ Instantly, I was in tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1tT1S"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, I have to ask this question, and I’m sure you’re going to get it a lot. When you were selected, and they said your profession was a drilling engineer, obviously, people &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tweetsoutloud/status/1468057868322566146?s=20"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;immediately thought of the oil drillers from &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Armageddon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. So I’m curious, since you have drilling experience: Do you think it’s &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ahtp0sjA5U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;easier to train oil drillers to be astronauts or to train astronauts to be drillers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RskJ5C"&gt;Well, you know what, the beauty of it is now they get to test the theory, right? I want to go with, ‘Hey, you know what, it’s okay to train an oil driller to be an astronaut.’&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon outage isn’t just online: delivery vans and warehouse bots aren’t moving packages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZXDFa_O2tmxo1BuufF5hr3kUA0=/0x0:3896x2597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240988/1155745592.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="goafai"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822332/amazon-server-aws-down-disney-plus-ring-outage"&gt;Amazon Web Services outage that started this morning&lt;/a&gt; might be worse than it seemed. That’s not only because it’s reportedly cutting off some streams from Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, and Netflix, but because the apps that keep warehouse, delivery, and Amazon Flex workers connected are down, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPKHhy"&gt;Amazon has confirmed it’s “experiencing elevated error rates for EC2 APIs in the US-EAST-1” region, meaning that connections from one of its largest server operations are spotty at best. Posts in the Amazon employee subreddits say many people can’t access the &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amazon-a-to-z/id1413909063?mt=8"&gt;AtoZ app&lt;/a&gt; that manages practically everything about their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWrEsI"&gt;Warehouse workers report entire facilities shut down due to network problems and have &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AmazonFC/comments/rb4pj2/currently_at_cle2/"&gt;posted pictures&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s automated shelves sitting motionless. Truck drivers report they used pen and paper forms to check each load out, assuming they could leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHdOqJ"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-07/amazon-aws-users-report-issues-accessing-services?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, three delivery service partners said the app they use to communicate with Amazon is down, leaving vans sitting idle instead of getting on the road to distribute packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LbS4u"&gt;The most recent update &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/#SA_block"&gt;from Amazon&lt;/a&gt; regarding the issue came at 2:26PM ET, saying, “We are pursuing multiple mitigation paths in parallel, and have seen some signs of recovery, but we do not have an ETA for full recovery at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
