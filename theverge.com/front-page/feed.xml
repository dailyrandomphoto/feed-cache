    <title>Apple clarifies that iOS 14.5 won’t let you permanently choose a new default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pceXmG"&gt;iOS 14.5 is in beta right now, and the first beta appeared to have a long-awaited feature: it seemed you would be able to set Spotify and other music services as the default for Siri requests. But Apple has clarified &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/04/apple-clarifies-you-cant-actually-set-a-default-music-service-in-ios-14-5/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the feature doesn’t actually work that way. Instead, selecting a music service for Siri requests is apparently intended to improve Siri’s smarts so that it can better know your audio-listening preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="penUze"&gt;In our testing of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272460/apple-ios-14-5-default-music-streaming-service-siri-spotify"&gt;the first iOS 14.5 beta&lt;/a&gt;, when you would ask Siri to play a song, it would show a list of music services to play a song from. After you made your choice, Siri song requests would then play from the service you selected without requiring you to pick again. But you’re not actually picking a default service, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnCp6L"&gt;“The feature is an attempt to help Siri to learn the listening apps you want to use for different types of audio content — not just music,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “Perhaps you want to use Spotify to listen to music, but prefer to keep up with your podcasts in Apple Podcasts or some other third-party podcasts app. And you may want to listen to audiobooks in yet another app.” Apple’s assistant may even ask your preference again in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyDZHb"&gt;Apple also noted to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;that there’s no setting in iOS where you can set your music service default, unlike the options available for setting a default email service or browser. (We also observed this when we tested the feature with the first beta of iOS 14.5.) However, you can still ask that a song play from a specific service as part of your Siri request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAXYrI"&gt;Apple still seems to be tweaking the feature, as it was &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/02/17/hands-on-with-ios-14-5-beta-2-changes-and-features-video/"&gt;dropped from the second beta&lt;/a&gt; before being reintroduced this week with the third. And because it is still in beta, there’s always the chance the feature could change ahead of the final release, though we’ve asked Apple if it can confirm that it will appear in the public version of iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators ask FTC to fight stalkers exploiting people search sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Continuing Resolution" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hhtkIwzJojXpKsyoGI_3uQitLfw=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913088/908866726.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CfcPDF"&gt;Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) want the Federal Trade Commission to take steps to protect people who have experienced abuse and stalking from invasive people search sites, potentially including measures to help them remove their addresses from data brokers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2aZzJE"&gt;“We write to express serious concerns about recent reports that data brokers are publicizing the location and contact information of victims of domestic violence, sexual violence, and stalking,” the senators wrote in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136"&gt;the letter&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/541616-klobuchar-murkowski-urge-ftc-to-protect-domestic-abuse-victims-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt; reporter&lt;/a&gt; Chris Mills Rodrigo posted online. “We have serious concerns that third-party data brokers play a role in revealing [a] protected address and providing access to personal information that can lead to continued abuse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NgOiom"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;here's the bipartisan letter in full &lt;a href="https://t.co/jDxs2xsjlZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jDxs2xsjlZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— chris mills rodrigo (@chrisismills) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chrisismills/status/1367521239049392136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dcD8VU"&gt;The letter cites &lt;a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/personal-information/i-tried-to-get-my-name-off-peoplesearch-sites-it-was-nearly--a0741114794"&gt;a 2020 &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; about the risks of data brokers like Intelius and Spokeo — which are promoted as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/14945884/people-search-sites-history-privacy-regulation"&gt;modern-day phone books&lt;/a&gt;, offering phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and other information. These sites have takedown policies, but the sheer volume of services — as well as the way they automatically scrape personal data — can make it almost impossible to permanently keep phone numbers or addresses offline. That’s despite some state laws regulating data brokers or offering confidentiality programs to people threatened by stalkers or abusers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOKXAT"&gt;Murkowski and Klobuchar ask the FTC to outline how it could coordinate with other agencies to keep violent abuse perpetrators from accessing personal information, as well as its current measures to help educate victims about data broker services and help them in the event of a privacy breach. The letter also asks if the agency has plans to prevent brokers from “collecting, buying, or selling lists of vulnerable populations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5qiNg"&gt;The letter could be a precursor to more congressional action around abuse and privacy online. Klobuchar, for instance, recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;sponsored the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt; — which adds legal liability for sites that host harassment or stalking-related content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube will lift Trump’s suspension when ‘the risk of violence has decreased’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TUDz3rk2RLalFXGJvmQ-1pMQV-A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68913077/acastro_180403_1777_youtube_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FzdKUy"&gt;YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki says the site will lift former President Donald Trump’s suspension when the risk of him inciting violence decreases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="obbmQI"&gt;Trump was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended in January&lt;/a&gt; after encouraging supporters to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, just before a violent attack on the US Capitol. Unlike similar suspensions on Twitter and Facebook, however, his YouTube channel suspension was &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/19/youtube-extends-trump-suspension-for-another-week.html"&gt;described as temporary&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Nl-pl667U&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;In a new interview&lt;/a&gt; with the head of the Atlantic Council think tank, Wojcicki offered a more concrete description of how — although not precisely when — Trump could return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPUhR"&gt;“The channel remains suspended due to the risk of incitement to violence,” Wojcicki said. “Given the warnings by the Capitol Police yesterday about a potential attack today, I think it’s pretty clear that that elevated violence risk still remains. However, I do want to confirm that we will lift the suspension of the channel. We will lift the suspension of the Donald Trump channel when we determine that the risk of violence has decreased. That’s per our policies, that’s how our three strikes system works. But when the channel is reinstated, it will be subject to the same policies that every other channel follows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dgKHvt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_0Nl-pl667U?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1700&amp;amp;start=1700" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0lmEE"&gt;Wojcicki noted that Trump could be given a second or third strike if he uploads more content that incites violence or violates YouTube’s election integrity policies; after three strikes with a 90-day period, a channel is removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH2TOR"&gt;Trump was permanently suspended from Twitter and Facebook. However, it’s possible he will also return to Facebook in the future — since the semi-independent Facebook Oversight Board is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;reviewing his ban&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6ytBA"&gt;Meanwhile, federal investigators are still investigating the January attack on the Capitol, reportedly including &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/20/us/politics/justice-dept-roger-stone-capitol-riot.html"&gt;the potential role&lt;/a&gt; of Trump associate Roger Stone. Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/03/us/politics/capitol-riot-qanon-trump.html"&gt;police warned&lt;/a&gt; of a “possible” follow-up plot by right-wing militia members — possibly inspired by the QAnon conspiracy movement, which has circulated false claims that Trump will return to the White House on March 4th. Congress canceled the day’s session in response.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Porsche unveils a pair of ridiculously expensive electric bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3A0tKVFXcG0Hc3DD0jWmEBMCgSQ=/0x108:2560x1815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912976/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tHBhu0"&gt;Porsche is the latest automaker to try its hand at making and selling electric bikes, and the result looks very interesting and very expensive. The Volkswagen-owned company announced that it would start selling a pair of full-suspension e-bikes this spring. The bikes were announced alongside the Porsche Taycan Cross Turismo, which was just unveiled today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwNiWZ"&gt;There are two models of Porsche e-bike, the Sport and the Cross. The Sport is a road bike intended for everyday use, with a full-suspension carbon fiber frame, integrated front and rear lights, Shimano mid-drive motor, and a price tag that would make Jeff Bezos blush. The Sport, which weighs a little less than 48 pounds, will set you back about $10,700, which is just an astonishing price for an e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8cHqeSp8896lBAx9FflLzPMHV4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345773/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_mood_urban_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4qySVU8s6JpVVz9-qvQLRGffTlo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345783/Porsche_eBike_SPORT_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IJPwzQ"&gt;But then again, carbon fiber frame bikes are traditionally more expensive than other bikes, and the Porsche badge on the head tube is worth a premium to a certain cross-section of bike rider. (I’m often reminded of how much money serious racing bike enthusiasts will spend, not just on the bike itself, but on all of the gear that goes with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucupwb"&gt;The Cross is more for off-roading adventures, Porsche says. It also sports a Shimano mid-drive, carbon fiber frame, and full suspension, in addition to Magura-MT Trail hydraulic disc brakes that are extra-large and “heat resistant.” It weighs 48.7 pounds and will retail for $8,549. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khCASodcfMLH_L8vXH7c_QXUdBc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345784/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_mood_outdoor_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ici2P03qv1W8kV8CIu3ADjyzN_s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345777/Porsche_eBike_CROSS_angle_view_front_scaled.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hWWWrZ"&gt;The Shimano EP8 motor that is featured in both bikes is smaller than previous versions — Porsche describes it as “ultra-compact” — and provides up to 25 km/h of pedal-assisted support. (Seems slow, but that’s the legal top speed allowed under European Union regulations.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVOs7T"&gt;Porsche is the latest company specializing in combustion engine vehicles to dip a toe into the world of electric two-wheelers. Aside from the price, there’s some reason to be skeptical. Often, when you hear about car companies releasing their own electric bikes, most of the time, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate cost-cutting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7za3ip"&gt;But occasionally, something interesting emerges, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;Harley-Davidson’s recently released Serial 1 e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. Porsche’s bikes are sure to find an audience among the same people who love the 911 or Taycan, but it remains to be seen whether it will be a long-term business for the automaker. Both bikes will be available for purchase starting in spring 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I tried the Nuggs, and they tasted like memes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Some nuggets sitting in front of a Nuggs box, which has an image of a chicken being offered a nugget." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wSiBSLUs0sFVQBo3T_kYAgl-36A=/0x540:2393x2135/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912189/NUGGS_box_nuggets.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold the Nuggs.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Simulate&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Every version of the chicken simulation&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Cfe7le"&gt;“Welcome to the simulation” read a card inside the package sent to me by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Simulate&lt;/a&gt;, the company responsible for the Nuggs brand of plant-based chicken nuggets. Inside the package, nestled among some dry ice, were what looked like several specimen bags. Each bag contained two Nuggs, from version 1.0 to version 2.0 with six versions in between. They were each carefully labeled: “Project: The Verge. Variant: V.1.6.” As I transferred the cargo to my freezer, I felt less like I was putting away some groceries and more like I was participating in a lab experiment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5JVhd0"&gt;That’s the kind of energy Simulate is going for. Its branding is simultaneously silly and self-serious, and it’s deliberately steeped in internet culture. The &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/nuggs/"&gt;Nuggs Instagram&lt;/a&gt; is almost entirely memes, with product announcements interspersed sparingly. “The name Nuggs is funny to most people, so we kind of leaned on that,” says Ben Pasternak, the company’s founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="exbn71"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkLFCN"&gt;Jokes aside, Simulate, founded in 2019, is part of an industry where the competition is only getting more serious. Meat alternatives have been around for decades — Morningstar Farms was founded in the mid-1970s — but the last few years have seen an explosion of similar products as companies have gotten better at mimicking meat. A combo platter of advanced food tech and concerns about the sustainability of factory farming has made more people than ever willing to give not-meats a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAnb1a"&gt;The giants are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22193672/beyond-meat-ceo-interview-ethan-brown-decoder-podcast"&gt;Beyond Meat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192336/impossible-foods-ceo-interview-vergecast-podcast-plant-based-meat"&gt;Impossible Foods&lt;/a&gt;, both of which make plant-based patties that are meant to be as indistinguishable from beef as possible, going so far as to make them “bleed.” In the chicken nugget space, &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2020/2/4/21122370/kfc-beyond-chicken-nuggets-fake-meat"&gt;Beyond Meat paired up with KFC&lt;/a&gt; to offer plant-based nuggets at select locations of the chicken-based chain. &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetforgrieve/2020/09/18/morningstar-farms-courts-kids-with-vegan-nuggets-shaped-like-mickey-mouse/?sh=17f3a43e5170"&gt;Morningstar Farms recently partnered with Disney&lt;/a&gt; to bring Mickey-shaped nuggets to the freezer aisle. Even Big Chicken companies like Tyson have &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/13/tyson-foods-unveils-plant-based-nuggets-in-move-into-meat-alternatives.html"&gt;plant-based offerings&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIvhbk"&gt;Which brings me back to Simulate, Pasternak, and my freezer full of experimental Nuggs. Pasternak sees Tyson as competition, but he’s more interested in putting his nuggets head-to-head with its chicken-based products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwivRx"&gt;Unlike other companies that keep most of their development behind closed doors, Pasternak says he wants to “operate from a place of truth,” showing everyone the changes Simulate’s recipe has gone through. When I was offered the chance to peek inside the lab (virtually) and try every single version of the company’s Nuggs, I figured why not. You know, for science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYiVoR"&gt;Each version of Nuggs comes with release notes, similar to software updates. “Nuggs 2.0 includes fixes and improvements,” says the Simulate site. “Enables a close to indistinguishable chicken flavor.” You can only buy the latest version (in this case, Nuggs 2.0), but &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Freleases%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the notes for each past version&lt;/a&gt; live on the site. Looking through the notes while eating each Nugg added some fun insights to my experience. Version 1.5, which “enable[d] decreased sodium content,” did indeed taste less salty than Version 1.4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L29cFj"&gt;Pasternak began his career building software, which explains why software updates show up in Simulate’s branding. He thinks of Simulate as a nutritional company with a software framework, where new iterations of the product are constantly being developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A skinned nugget sits on the side of a microscope while a nugget sliver is in the slide." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34Z2XRFxMSu6qeT7jTsRREm3QFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342542/Image_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Nugg ready for examination.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NKMumt"&gt;And there have been plenty of iterations. Doug Henderson and Bob Schultz, two of the five&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Simulate food engineers who spend their days poking and prodding simulated nuggets, say that for every version of Nuggs released, there were hundreds more&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;tested in the lab. They use devices that press, squeeze, and tear the Nuggs to measure and track tiny changes in their cohesiveness, chewiness, and springiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27uwEm"&gt;Between Versions 1.6 and 2.0, they put together a database of every plant-based meat product on the market so they could track and compare them to Nuggs. The constant testing and comparison led them to switch from pea protein — which Schultz says is an “immature technology” with several texture and flavor issues — to wheat and soy proteins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBvbpv"&gt;My own judgment of the Nuggs was much less rigorous. I have not eaten a nugget that originated from an actual chicken in about 14 years, and I therefore am less than qualified to say how close in taste and texture Nuggs and chicken nuggets are. I &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; say that my face journeyed from a grimace at a strange aftertaste in Version 1.0 to a contented nod at the crunch of Version 2.0. I didn’t get to experience the Simulate &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsimulate.com%2Fsauce%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22308229%2Fsimulate-nuggs-fake-chicken-plant-based-memes" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BBQ sauce&lt;/a&gt;, but I did divide my duos of Nuggs for a highly scientific taste test. For each version, I tried one Nugg plain; these were my control group. I added hot sauce to the other for an extremely research-driven reason. (I really like hot sauce.) The verdict: they are very good vehicles for hot sauce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rx6Bty"&gt;I’ve never been particularly interested in products that aim to perfectly re-create meat. The idea grosses me out, even though I appreciate the novelty. But Pasternak sees Nuggs as a product that should appeal to all people, vegans and meat lovers alike. (Though the current price of $35 for 32 ounces of Nuggs online, and $7 for 10.4 ounces in retail, might dissuade people in either camp.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hands of two people, crossed at the wrists, holding nuggets that are almost touching. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-DcvwB3zDnKfeZB8JZqUBF_Ry3o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342576/NUGGS_2020_0495.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Simulate&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These nuggets are not here to proselytize.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rx05IP"&gt;Part of Simulate’s brand mission is to remain “non-preachy.” The people behind the company aren’t pushing a specific vegan or vegetarian agenda — “We wanted to not use any of the V words,” Pasternak tells me — they just want to make a good nugget. “We don’t want to tell anybody that this is a healthy food,” says Schultz, “we just want it to be the best chicken nugget experience you possibly can have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1voH2N"&gt;That makes sense since plant-based doesn’t automatically equate healthy. “We didn’t evolve to eat ultra processed foods and these meat substitutes are ultra processed foods,” says Marion Nestle, a Nutrition and Food Studies professor at NYU. “People would be much better off eating real food.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl66wB"&gt;Other experts take a softer stance: these aren’t health foods, but they are at least healthier than real nuggets — which, for the record, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/12/robert-c-baker-the-man-who-invented-chicken-nuggets.html"&gt;were also developed in a lab&lt;/a&gt;. Nuggs are processed, but they’re lower in cholesterol, a major contributor to heart disease. “If you’re taking that cholesterol out, and you can provide consumers with an alternative, then why not?” says Jillian Semaan, director of food and environment at Earth Day Network, an environmental activism nonprofit. As the Simulate site boasts, Nuggs “kill you slower.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMFdzX"&gt;Simulated meats are also better for the planet, says Semaan. There’s no livestock involved when making meat from plants, meaning there’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22287498/meat-wildlife-biodiversity-species-plantbased"&gt;less land required&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane"&gt;greenhouse gas burps&lt;/a&gt;. “We need to take a closer look at how we’re using our resources,” she says. Whether it’s Nuggs or other plant-based foods, “it’s kind of a no-brainer when it comes to having a sustainable place for all of us to live on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="do6M3C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are taking a closer look at what they’re eating”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vk26ps"&gt;Pasternak hopes that simulated meats will become more popular than their animal-based counterparts in the next few decades. Semaan isn’t sure the tide will turn so quickly, but she does see a shift happening. “I think people are taking a closer look at what they’re eating, how food is grown, and what foods that they can consume,” she says. “That’s going to be for the betterment of themselves and the planet.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFLb2Y"&gt;I could pretend otherwise, but I really wasn’t thinking much about the planet, or my own health, while I was munching on the different variations of Nuggs. My deepest thoughts were more along the lines of “This first version tastes like a shoe,” and “There’s a nice amount of seasoning in this breading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P2IsGg"&gt;Personally, when I’m staring down the shelves in the grocery store, taste and ease of preparation are further toward the front of my mind than a product’s environmental impact. Ultimately, even after going through the entire experiment, I still don’t know if Nuggs taste like chicken or if they will be the future of sustainable food. But I did find that they were enjoyable enough to eat when a hankering for nuggets strikes — along with some hot sauce, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP5U9i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 4th, 3:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story implied there are only two engineers who spend their days poking and prodding the Nuggs. There are five. We regret the error. This story has also been updated with the retail price for Nuggs. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New funding models can help riskier games — and might change studios in the process</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3txffwXdTcnJsFEJaIjHUrZ3OoU=/0x0:1653x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912955/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_12.50.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OUxlBB"&gt;Evva Karr was frustrated. During talks with creators, they’d begun to notice a theme: the conversation always seemed to turn to funding. Developers wanted to know how &lt;em&gt;HyperDot &lt;/em&gt;creator Charles McGregor and Karr, who helped publish it, had shipped the game. Inevitably, the developers would share their own experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGIOTg"&gt;“While some of those deals were good news, others were just kind of shocking and really unimaginable to me,” Karr says. “There were just a lot of folks who were getting bad deals, not knowing what good deals even look like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ihotg"&gt;Karr, the founder and CEO of Glitch, wanted “a whole new damn table” — a way for developers to play with new ideas and make games that might be unappealing to traditional publishers. Earlier this year, they created &lt;a href="https://heyglitch.com/moonrise"&gt;Moonrise&lt;/a&gt;, a fund that promises to help a handful of candidates annually. It’s a collective of backers that range from directors at AAA devs to leaders at successful independent studios — a simple theory that throwing support behind people over projects that Karr has big aspirations for. “I think that Moonrise fund is going to change the way that we think about making games, funding games,” they say. There’s untapped potential for change not just in what developers will make, but how they choose to make it — and what studios arise as a result. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wYikCw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s an underserved market and money to be made”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1myOn"&gt;It’s not just funding for games; it’s funding for games that might otherwise be left out. Karr says the goal is to create a model for early prototype funding. “We wanted to design a different way to think about financing that gives creators options to raise those funds, work with publishers, or even team up with platforms that really isn’t focused on drawing money out at just the absolute wrong time,” Karr says. “We all recognize that there’s an underserved market and money to be made. Our approach is different because we only want to get paid when the creators are also getting paid — ideally, a very handsome amount when the time is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EggcMR"&gt;Funding options for video games have evolved over the years. From the traditional model of pitching to big publishers to the rise of crowdfunded efforts on platforms like Kickstarter, money comes in many forms. Indie publishers like Devolver Digital and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540676/annapurna-games-indie-publisher-development-studio"&gt;Annapurna&lt;/a&gt; offer a more boutique experience for a handful of titles. Groups like Indie Fund finance projects — though as outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/feb/15/video-game-funding-indie-investment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; note, “investors of Indie Fund perceive to be safe bets is a matter of perspective – and in a mostly white, cisgender male group, that perspective is arguably limited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B9bZYq"&gt;It’s a perspective that Karr echoes: “Our current funding sources are just quite risk-averse. Especially when we’re looking at studios that are founded by women or BIPOC or queer creators who are thinking bigger or differently about play, especially in new markets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tI53TP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s a big difference between a cool project and a cool project idea”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PRKV2s"&gt;Funding doesn’t just apply to money either, argues Karr. It comes down to the time and privilege someone has to even make games. “It’s either unpaid time, or borrowed time in a way,” says Karr. “Or it’s through savings, where someone has taken money to buy back their time in order to be able to create something.” Karr reflects on their own time during weekends and nights, spent drafting grants to secure funds. It also impacted the types of projects they worked on, restricting creativity in the name of making something that had a better chance of scoring necessary cash. “Early stage equity and financing in this way offers a way for people to buy their time back in order to be able to focus on the things they really want to do — and the games that they really want to make and put out into the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcB9Ds"&gt;Karr is less concerned with what teams want to make, as long as they can make it. “I don’t want them to have to ask for permission,” they say. Their interest is in people with a strong creative and technical background who brings a unique perspective on play. “I think there’s a big difference between a cool project and a cool project idea, or even a cool game idea vs. a mediocre game idea that a really great team can iterate and build off of to make into an even better game,” Karr says. “It’s just a different process. I don’t think they’re exclusive to one another.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dautS9"&gt;What makes a project appealing for something like Moonrise is also what could classify it as a risk for traditional publishers. “Seeing something at the earliest stages is often scary … it can be scary to think about funding towards it,” Karr says. Think barebones, a project distilled down to its most base ideas of play: no art, no form, just something to toy with — a paper prototype, a couple of on-screen cubes that move around a screen. “To the average person who plays, the games would be unrecognizable,” Karr says. “It just really hones in on interaction and discovering, or at least uncovering, the moments of fun and what makes something fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCsA1O"&gt;Much like the developers it benefits, Karr says Moonrise allows them to experiment. Funders can be a little risky about what they invest — a benefit that can help give new voices a way onto the field. “It’s really a system that has been created out of a desire for equity in a different sense,” Karr says. “It’s built out of trust and a shared love for play in this industry.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="iaMPZI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 2021 2:53PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Walmart will have &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPlayStation-5-Console%2F363472942&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition%2F493824815&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in stock today at 3PM ET. You can find more information on the retailer's restock &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22295709/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-walmart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kPqddq"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is available now. Due to the pandemic and high demand for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550842/sony-playstation-5-ps5-launch-day-in-store-purchases"&gt;retailers such as Best Buy and Target will only sell the console online&lt;/a&gt; for the foreseeable future. So, if you were planning to camp outside your local Target hoping to buy the console today, there will be no walk-in purchases available this year. But, you can order one online and request an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

The biggest difference to note is that the PS5 Digital Edition is smaller than the PS5 standard, costs $399, and it does not include a Blu-ray disc drive. The PS5 standard is $100 more, is a bit bulkier than the digital edition, and includes a disc drive, allowing you to play game discs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Turntable.fm is back from the dead — and now there are two</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33tVPQIbZ6wo_No2f0YGPruErd8=/175x0:1852x1118/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912610/Screen_Shot_2021_03_04_at_10.41.48_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jA3koz"&gt;It’s rare that apps come back from the dead, but it seems like that may be what’s happening with Turntable.fm, a site that let users create their own radio stations and DJ sets with music they curated before it got shuttered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526484/turntable-fm-founder-shuts-down-his-music-startup-and-launches-new"&gt;in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Even rarer, it seems like there are two versions involved in the revival: the original Turntable.fm site is back up and running (with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billychasen/status/1367530525104177155?s=20"&gt;involvement of its original founder&lt;/a&gt;, Billy Chasen), but there’s also Turntable.org, which will &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210202005883/en/All-new-Virtual-Music-Lounge-Turntable-to-Launch-in-Beta----April-2021"&gt;reportedly be launching in beta this April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsCZ9a"&gt;The two sites seem to be taking different directions: &lt;a href="http://Turntable.org"&gt;Turntable.org&lt;/a&gt;, the new version, mentions there will be a subscription fee (perhaps not a bad idea, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/2/5167020/dropping-the-needle-the-life-and-death-of-turntable-fm"&gt;given the fate of the first version&lt;/a&gt;), while the original seems to be largely unchanged from the one that shut down in 2014. While the original founder has confirmed he’s involved with the .fm version, the .org version also has OGs working on it: the Our Team section mentions an original Turntable founding member as well as the artist who designed the original avatars in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uLVpsY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10374548"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dPxKNN"&gt;The original app, and the current Turntable.fm, lets you create a virtual room, then select what music you want to play for anyone listening. At the moment, the song selection seems to be limited to what’s available on YouTube, so you probably won’t be able to sneakily slide in your mixtape. There appears to be a SoundCloud integration that’s not working yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjFz6L"&gt;Also, the whole site seems to be phasing in and out of existence, perhaps due to word of its return getting around:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/khrrUWVVMiHBrjboRBrt7acrCD4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345870/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qdqr1U"&gt;Assuming you can find your way in, the audience can chat about your great (or awful) song selections. You can also co-DJ with collaborators, if you feel like riffing off a friend, or co-worker. While the app looks much the same as it used to, there are some 2021 updates: my avatar has a mask on, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22253363/wall-street-bets-verge-stories-gamestock-reddit-discord"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; stickers available for DJ’s virtual laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yk6KhDllLdl1-PVs2vyo_9dL9r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22345867/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nyan Cat and GameStop are both weirdly relevant in 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dRfRcQ"&gt;Turntable.fm shut down in 2013, after a drawn-out fight for survival that we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5134694/turntable-fm-shutting-down-focus-on-live-concert-service"&gt;watched closely&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/12/4722236/turntable-fm-kills-music-upload-fights-for-survival"&gt;hoping that the app would make it&lt;/a&gt;. Every piece of news since seemed to point to it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/19/5526484/turntable-fm-founder-shuts-down-his-music-startup-and-launches-new"&gt;never coming back&lt;/a&gt;, but today, the site popped back up again, asking for a password to gain access. To get access to the password, the site requests that you send an email including your favorite song (it says it’ll let you in if it’s a good song, so there go my chances).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2H9uV9"&gt;The original site was loved by many, including us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a welcome surprise to see it back. The world, especially the music industry, has changed a lot since 2013, and it remains to be seen what, if any, lessons Turntable.fm and Turntable.org take from the first go-around and from &lt;a href="https://www.jqbx.fm/"&gt;the replacements that have popped up&lt;/a&gt; since its demise. Turntable.fm’s About page still boasts that it’s music selected by people, not algorithms, which may be just the new / old thing I needed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uh7kl4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dropping the needle: the life and death of Turntable.fm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/2/5167020/dropping-the-needle-the-life-and-death-of-turntable-fm"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The days of knowing how big a movie is are seemingly over in a streaming-first era</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJZUICiQF3YpwbKMXWuIT-HmPTk=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68912330/billie_eilish_doc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0jz2Fx"&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/streaming/22303848/billie-eilish-documentary-review"&gt;debuted on Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt;. The documentary became the “biggest hit title for young adult audiences that Apple has had so far across its slate of films and TV series,” &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry-huge-global-ratings-apple-tv-plus-1234705943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drawing a “record-breaking 33 percent new viewers to the service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YM3Az"&gt;Sounds impressive, right? It would if Apple provided any kind of context for declarations like “biggest hit” and “record-breaking” subscriber adds. Instead, we’re left wondering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s6ToRp"&gt;How many subscribers does Apple TV Plus have currently? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xTS31W"&gt;How many people actually watched &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWjS4R"&gt;How many of those new subscribers are on free Apple TV Plus trial plans? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J8U8B7"&gt;How do those viewership numbers and subscriber additions compare to every other title?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="dzhb6w"&gt;Without any of this context, 10 million people could have watched &lt;em&gt;Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry &lt;/em&gt;or 10,000 people. I was one of them! But there’s a stark difference between those two figures. In a pre-streaming world, if the documentary was released in theaters or debuted on a network like MTV, there would be actual statistics. Weekly box office reports and Nielsen breakdowns exist to provide public insight into how well a movie or TV show is performing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFpEIm"&gt;It’s not just Apple either — with a stronger push to streaming, there’s no reason for companies to divulge numbers. As more original series and films premiere on streaming services, and as more films get taken out of theaters early to move onto a streaming service, the idea of what’s considered an official hit becomes much more difficult to track. Here are just some examples for the past few months: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oCeZBI"&gt;Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21566042/trailers-fresh-prince-breach-black-beauty-happiest-season-pixar-netflix-hulu-hbo-disney"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;was the “most-watched film across all acquired and Hulu Original films” over its opening weekend. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="B7rIOw"&gt;Just a few weeks prior to &lt;em&gt;Happiest Season&lt;/em&gt;, Hulu’s &lt;em&gt;Run &lt;/em&gt;set the record for the “most-watched film ever on Hulu during its opening weekend.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="agw09I"&gt;HBO Max’s &lt;em&gt;The Little Things &lt;/em&gt;“quickly shot up to number one” in its opening weekend, according to WarnerMedia executive Andy Forssell. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jAzhcC"&gt;As of right now, there’s no reason for the companies to release numbers. It’s a pick ‘em on will strategy. A movie or TV show does astoundingly well, and that’s a good reason for a company like Disney or Netflix to send out a blast. (Video game publishers use a similar numbers-boasting strategy.) Netflix will note that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;99 million household accounts&lt;/a&gt; watched &lt;em&gt;at least two minutes &lt;/em&gt;of &lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;within the first four weeks of its release. It sounds really good! It’s also, unfortunately, the most upfront a streaming service is about viewership. But how many people finished watching &lt;em&gt;Extraction &lt;/em&gt;compared to how many people might have thrown it on and decided after five minutes to just watch &lt;em&gt;The Witcher &lt;/em&gt;again or do something else entirely? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xyXlf"&gt;None of this matters to the streaming companies. Netflix has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;more than 203 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; and is growing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;, Hulu, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253988/peacock-nbcuniversal-comcast-streaming-broadband"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; are also growing, based on quarterly earnings. Apple has never announced how many subscribers Apple TV Plus has, but third-party analyst firms have repeatedly pointed out that a significant portion of its subscriber base &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/apple-tv-plus-freeloader-problem-percent-free-1234890385/"&gt;is using free trial periods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A73SxA"&gt;The box office doesn’t dictate quality, but it does track global cultural phenomenons. As Todd Boyd, a professor of popular culture at the University of Southern California &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2012/12/17/167256415/no-1-at-the-box-office-four-reasons-why-it-doesnt-matter"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “they’re like some huge event that for many people is an option for them to say that ‘I participated in something that a lot of other people also participated in,’ and this allows them to be defined as part of a group.” In the case of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, people rallied to try to make it the most successful film of all time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20678706/avengers-endgame-avatar-box-office-marvel-disney"&gt;tracking daily box office numbers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2MQXH"&gt;Last year, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos told analysts the company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21526664/netflix-movies-billion-dollar-box-office-blockbuster-ted-sarandos-earnings"&gt;making the equivalent of billion-dollar movies&lt;/a&gt;. The billion-dollar movie — a new &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fast and Furious&lt;/em&gt;, Marvel, or DC title — speaks to the power of a cultural phenomenon, of a true pop culture moment. It’s a sign of something celebrated and experienced with millions of other people around the world — people who went to a movie and likely sat through the entire thing. As &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-the-netflix-hit.html"&gt;Bilge Ebiri wrote at &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, having public data about people who watched an entire movie on Netflix or Hulu or HBO Max “tells us not just whether a movie or show made it to the right people, but also whether those people stuck with it or not — maybe even, gasp, enjoyed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUBs5F"&gt;With the future of theaters so uncertain, this will only become a bigger problem being brought over to streaming platforms. Even less data will be made available about what swaths of people are watching. As a result, more viewing experiences will feel increasingly isolating. People like partaking in popular culture, in watching the hit that everyone else is watching — but figuring out what’s a hit and what isn’t is getting much harder to determine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BHa1v0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnTwhQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfYnOg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jb6Otv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 4th, 2021 2:24PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;has stock available for the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-S%2F606518560&amp;amp;subid1=vergenextgenrestocks02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. You can find additional information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22295709/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-s-restock-walmart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.
