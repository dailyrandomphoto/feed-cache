    <title>Google denies Facebook collusion claims in new court filing and blog post</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google denies colluding with Facebook in new court filing | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wg7Xr3"&gt;Google has filed a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184858/Google_MTD_1_21_2022.pdf"&gt;motion to dismiss&lt;/a&gt; the antitrust complaint filed last week, which alleges it colluded with Facebook to manipulate programmatic ad markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdG0Hp"&gt;“State Plaintiffs’ complaint — cheered on by a handful of Google’s rivals who have failed to invest properly, compete successfully, or innovate consistently — might serve the narrow interests of those rivals,” Google argues in the motion, “but it also threatens to stifle the dynamism that drives Google and other firms to deliver the products on which businesses and consumers depend every day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IDI9EX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The complaint misrepresents our business, products, and motives”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe6alL"&gt;Originally filed in November, the antitrust suit has been led by Texas attorney general Ken Paxton of Texas and has gradually revealed more allegations through a series of revised complaints. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883987/mark-zuckerberg-sundar-pichai-ad-collusion-tx-ag-paxton-complaint"&gt;complaint filed last week&lt;/a&gt; provided particularly specific details about Google’s alleged collusion with Facebook, including a project nicknamed “Jedi Blue” that the suit says intended to limit ad header bidding practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpRyTo"&gt;The new complaint relies on internal emails that show the Jedi Blue deal was reviewed with input from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta / Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Sheryl Sandberg. But Google has denied that the deal involved any anticompetitive behavior and says it was approved without Pichai’s direct approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idnHGI"&gt;Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Google, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; accompanying the new response that the allegations are “more heat than light” and that Google doesn’t think they meet the legal standard to bring the case to trial. “The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z2q0uI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OEI2Fz"&gt;At the heart of the lawsuit is the allegation that publishers are forced to use Google’s ad server to access its ad exchange. But Google says this claim is incorrect, “and AG Paxton offers no evidence to prove otherwise.” The company also disputes allegations that it has held back rivals from using its Open Bidding program and that it rigged ad auctions to favor Facebook. In addition, Cohen says, the lawsuit is based on outdated information “that bears no correlation to our current products or business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKm3cp"&gt;The new complaint quoted a 2015 email in which “Google employees expressed fear that Google’s exchange might ‘actually have to compete’ with other exchanges at some point in the future.” A newly unredacted section of the complaint also alleges that Google made concessions to Facebook as part of Jedi Blue, which gave Facebook an advantage in auctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVaMdD"&gt;In its motion to dismiss, Google argues that the lawsuit does not illustrate any anticompetitive conduct. “Despite amassing a lengthy collection of grievances, each one comes down to a plea for Google to share its data or to design its products in ways that would help its rivals,” the motion states. “The Sherman Act requires no such thing. None of the conduct alleged in the [complaint] falls into the narrow exception to the general rule that any firm may choose with whom it will deal, and courts are rightly skeptical of challenges to how a company designs its own products, especially when innovation creates more choices for consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ts2WR4"&gt;Google also disputes Paxton’s claim that the company secretly colluded with the Facebook Audience Network via its Open Bidding agreement, with Cohen noting that the agreement is not exclusive and that it “&lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/latest-admob-updates-making-more-money-mobile-app-ads/?fbclid=IwAR3dY0kup3tTR1O_1dAHDaKecUUS-aduWQb_W_MNF-7VZVV3n0E55Ryaovc"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; FAN’s participation as one of over 25 partners in our Open Bidding program, all of whom have signed their own agreements to participate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hNIA2"&gt;Cohen added that Facebook participating in the agreement benefits advertisers and publishers. “In fact, if FAN &lt;em&gt;weren’t&lt;/em&gt; a part of Open Bidding, AG Paxton may have claimed we were preventing a rival from accessing our products and depriving publishers of additional revenue,” he wrote in the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3QZbX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5Lb2A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1gphO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Employees at Activision studio Raven Software formally organize union</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty Warzone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Laq8ITfLgdxzQjW_A5GTM6F05iQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416791/04C_IN_GAME_MODES_BR_TOUT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Activision&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TVCmCm"&gt;After five weeks of striking, the QA testers at Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision Blizzard, have formed one of the first unions in a AAA game publisher. The union, known as the &lt;a href="https://gameworkersalliance.com/"&gt;Game Workers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, was formed in association with the&lt;a href="https://cwa-union.org/"&gt; Communications Workers of America (CWA)&lt;/a&gt;, a labor union that represents telecommunications and digital media workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c7PJhN"&gt;Back in December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;12 QA workers were laid off&lt;/a&gt;, sparking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; support studio. Since then, some members of the QA department engaged in a sustained strike at Raven Software, prompting the creation of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826129/activision-blizzard-employees-create-strike-fund-while-taking-steps-toward-unionization"&gt;GoFundMe to support the striking members&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szatzy"&gt;“We formed the Game Workers Alliance (CWA) because my colleagues and I want to have our voices heard,” said Brent Reel, a QA lead at Raven, in a CWA press release. The union is asking for formal recognition from parent company Activision Blizzard, who, in recent SEC filings related to the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;pending acquisition by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-19-activision-blizzard-tells-sec-its-unaware-of-employee-strike"&gt;failed to acknowledge&lt;/a&gt; that a strike was taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUij2o"&gt;Activision Blizzard has also been engaged in alleged union-busting activities, with executives imploring workers to “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828146/activision-blizzard-exec-brain-bulatao-anti-unionization-letter"&gt;consider the consequences&lt;/a&gt;” of signing union authorization cards. Elsewhere in Activision Blizzard, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Treyarch recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467936015071559683"&gt;converted all contract employees to full-time positions&lt;/a&gt;, prompting questions as to why Raven Software could not do similarly. The formation of the union comes a week before the formal termination of the laid-off workers was to take place on January 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nly4oe"&gt;Rich George, senior director of game communications at Activision Blizzard, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ld1cT4"&gt;“Activision Blizzard is carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition from the CWA, which seeks to organize around three dozen of the company’s nearly 10,000 employees. While we believe that a direct relationship between the company and its team members delivers the strongest workforce opportunities, we deeply respect the rights of all employees under the law to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpE185"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK"&gt;A Better ABK&lt;/a&gt;, an Activision Blizzard employee advocacy group, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1484563155464462342"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are so incredibly excited for our allies at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WeAreGWA"&gt;@WeAreGWA&lt;/a&gt;. It has taken months of meticulous planning and careful work to get where we are today, but we couldn’t have done it without each other. Thank you to everyone who has publicly supported us and stay tuned. We’re not done yet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTt0eY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W4EjyC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkKxsA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGdPx6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PdzOjp"&gt;With the rise of the Omicron variant, we’ve been urged to use COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to make sure that we don’t spread the virus to friends and family. However, it’s been very difficult to follow that suggestion, what with long lines at COVID testing stations and high prices for home kits — when you can find them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euZO1K"&gt;To try to alleviate this situation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889571/free-covid-19-tests-usps-website"&gt;the US federal government has created a website&lt;/a&gt; where you can order four free rapid test kits per month per household. While the site was scheduled to officially open Wednesday, January 19th, it started taking names and addresses a day early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRPiGo"&gt;It’s extremely simple to put in your order. You will not need to submit a credit card or any other financial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HeKtVl"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://covidtests.gov/"&gt;COVIDTests.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KSN8FP"&gt;Tap on the button reading “Order Free At-Home Tests.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1XuoG7"&gt;If you don’t see the button for any reason, you can go directly to the USPS site (which is where the button would send you anyway) at &lt;a href="https://special.usps.com/testkits"&gt;special.usps.com/testkits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DLzP1J"&gt;Fill in your name, email address (if you want to receive notifications), and shipping address.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="egN7Sd"&gt;Click on the green “Check Out Now” button — and you’re done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vWK2i6OSwH_RhFwxKvSiPp2A0Gs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23177189/Screen_Shot_2022_01_18_at_1.34.45_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The USPS form for ordering free rapid tests is very simple.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNKDCC"&gt;So far, we haven’t had any reports of problems with the site itself, although (as can be imagined), it’s highly popular. (According to the site &lt;a href="http://analytics.usa.gov"&gt;analytics.usa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, as of 2PM on Tuesday, January 18th, over 700,000 people had already visited the website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a05RJ0"&gt;There is now also a phone number if you have difficulty accessing the internet or have any problems placing an order: 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQEAia"&gt;The kits are supposed to ship within 7–12 days, starting in late January. Until then, as far as rapid tests are concerned, we’re still on our own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQTbBP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt;Some apartment dwellers are reporting problems with putting in an order if somebody else in their building already did:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BLXfsZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Houston, we have a problem!  People at same street address but different apartment numbers are being refused free COVID test kits at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS"&gt;https://t.co/Rm7vj6zgKS&lt;/a&gt; if another apartment dweller ordered first.  This happened to me and I’m not the only one. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USPS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#USPS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CovidTesting?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CovidTesting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZllXT7m6jq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZllXT7m6jq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicky Sundt (@NickySundt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NickySundt/status/1483521702315405315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 18, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KBv29U"&gt;There have been a number of solutions suggested if this happens to you, including putting your apartment number on the same line as your street address, putting your apartment number on the second address line, or using a word (such as “suite” or “apartment”) rather than a hash sign. None of these have been verified; we’ll let you know if we hear anything further. Meanwhile, if you’re having problems, you can try the 800 number mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Microsoft to acquire Activision,  Google building a headset, and the 5G battle with airlines</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7uk013"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where we discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kb4LEK"&gt;The biggest news in tech this week was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft acquiring game publisher Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; for $68.7 billion. On today’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with games reporter Ash Parrish and senior reporter Alex Heath about the acquisition, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;the issues behind the culture&lt;/a&gt; at Activision Blizzard, and what this means for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889457/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-mobile-gaming-candy-crush"&gt;gaming space in the future. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jt0c8k"&gt;The crew also discusses Alex’s scoop this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22892152/google-project-iris-ar-headset-2024"&gt;Google is building an AR headset&lt;/a&gt;, internally codenamed Project Iris, that it hopes to ship in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V52eo3"&gt;Later in the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;policy editor Russell Brandom joins to discuss the ongoing battle between the FAA, AT&amp;amp;T, Verizon, and airlines over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889664/att-5g-limits-c-band-expansion-airports-further-carrier-airline"&gt;activating 5G towers around airports&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893641/antitrust-big-tech-reform-amazon-google-apple-klobuchar-grassley"&gt;tech antitrust bills&lt;/a&gt; developing in Congress this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Beats Fit Pro get their first major discount and drop to $153</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CQEt-_8D2BkuiFz7ldNZ8js-RGg=/0x39:1419x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70416262/_BeatsFitPro_4FAM_Lifestyle_0036_WEB_v4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Fit Pro come in black, gray, white, and pink. Today’s deal is on the black and white colorways.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Beats&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Vc0Erx"&gt;Time and time again, we see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"&gt;Apple AirPods and AirPods Pro wireless earbuds getting frequent discounts and deals&lt;/a&gt;. In general, if you want to buy any pair of true wireless earbuds — with active noise cancellation or without — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats"&gt;you should be able to find a deal somewhere&lt;/a&gt;. One holdout that has been elusive up to now was the Beats Fit Pro. These latest models from Apple-owned Beats came out in late 2021 and surprised us with how good they are — even besting the AirPods Pro in the sound quality department. They have held steady at their $199.99 price point the whole time, but now they finally see a discount of about $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hePsYN"&gt;Today, you can pick up the Beats Fit Pro on sale from Amazon and Walmart. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Fit-Pro-Cancelling-Built/dp/B09JL41N9C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has both black and white colorways for $153.11&lt;/a&gt; (add it to your cart to see the price), while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBeats-Fit-Pro-True-Wireless-Earbuds-Beats-Black%2F232379973&amp;amp;subid1=beatsfitprobreakout012122" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has the black model matched at the same price&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has the white model on sale, but its discount is not as sizable. The funkier gray and purple colors remain at full price, but nothing beats black and white in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KNqYcD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10844241"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TESug6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22753158/beats-fit-pro-earbuds-review-apple"&gt;In our review of the Beats Fit Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Welch found the wing tips to be comfortable over long listening sessions — offering a more secure fit than the AirPods Pro. The sound quality is excellent, and the active noise cancellation and transparency mode are of the same caliber you expect from Apple and the AirPods Pro. The biggest caveats of these earbuds are their more limited functionality with Android phones and their lack of wireless charging. You have to plug the case in via USB-C, which is still nice to have in lieu of a Lightning port. At this discounted price, it’s easier to overlook these flaws, and if you use Apple products, you get all the conveniences of the H1 chip and deeper OS integration and connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nwwFyhC7ZPVVKpAaM-7gBbzqu-g=/15x0:1065x700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414132/s22U.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1476660792527306754" target="_blank"&gt;evleaks (Twitter)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WA4EOF"&gt;For the launch of Samsung’s next flagship smartphones — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;the Galaxy S22, S22 Plus, and S22 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;, we think — the Korean electronics giant will once again let you signal your intent to buy its phones &lt;em&gt;before they’re even announced&lt;/em&gt;, much less go on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq7k0V"&gt;So if you’re the kind of person who absolutely &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; the new Samsung handset before anyone else (except influencers, journalists, and the like), you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsVu5GbT1T" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this page at Samsung’s site&lt;/a&gt; to reserve a preorder for one of these unannounced phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdVcCO"&gt;If it’s anything like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202683/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-plus-s-pen-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335591/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-preorder-reserve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;occasions&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t need to plunk down a virtual wad of cash just yet — you’re simply reserving a slot to order the phone later, typically after the company’s actual smartphone keynote (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;coming February, the company just confirmed&lt;/a&gt;) ends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C1x8wX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung confirms February Unpacked, hints at the end of the Note line","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893640/samsung-unpacked-february-2022-galaxy-s22-ultra"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vZ4vx5"&gt;Like before, you’ll also get $50 of credit towards other Samsung Galaxy products when you preorder, so maybe there’s a free case or charger in your future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3LEQb1"&gt;While we don’t have official details on what the new phones are quite yet, they have leaked fairly extensively as usual, and the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, in particular, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;expected to effectively be the new Galaxy Note, stylus and all&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung mobile president TM Roh threw some gas on that fire &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-setting-a-new-standard-for-smartphones-in-our-changing-world" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in a blog post today,&lt;/a&gt; too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N8T6m4"&gt;We know many of you were surprised when Samsung didn’t release a new Galaxy Note last year. You loved the unparalleled creativity and efficiency of the  Galaxy Note series, which enabled you to switch from gaming nirvana to high-octane productivity in the blink of an eye. You raved about the lifelike S Pen, which many say rivals putting ink to paper. And we haven’t forgotten about these experiences you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xjUcBQ"&gt;“At Unpacked in February 2022, we’ll introduce you to the most noteworthy S series device we’ve ever created,” he adds later — clearly a play on the word noteworthy — and says that “you will help Samsung rewrite the future of smartphones once again.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDq6oK"&gt;If you’re still not convinced the Note is merging, there’s this video too:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AatdJO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_kk-AfcbNI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oj20J3"&gt;Otherwise, Samsung’s hinting the new phone will have a brighter camera for better night photos, claiming it will offer “game-changing Nightography,” and earlier this month, the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/17/22888966/samsung-exynos-2200-soc-chip-announced-amd-gpu-rdna-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new Exynos processor with AMD RDNA 2 graphics&lt;/a&gt; that might feature in the S22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DNQ7e"&gt;For a better sense, I’d suggest looking at the many leaks we’ve covered, which go over a variety of likely specs, including a wide array of cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AbhmFh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung’s Galaxy S22 lineup takes shape in unofficial leaks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"},{"title":"Samsung’s leaked Galaxy S22 Ultra is just straight up a Galaxy Note now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860479/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-leak-official-image-note-design"},{"title":"Samsung’s next tablet lineup could include a 14.6-inch ‘Ultra’ model with a notch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886595/samsung-tablet-lineup-ultra-notch-rumor"},{"title":"Samsung leaks new notched tablet on its own website","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890937/samsung-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra-tablet-android-leak"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="mjkMUb"&gt;And then, as always, I would suggest waiting for the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDBTys"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WtLbz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW review: tough choices</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The DuraSport 5G is one of the few rugged options available&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="XH6g5P"&gt;After releasing the tank-like $899.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446490/kyocera-duraforce-ultra-5g-uw-review-price-specs-screen-camera"&gt;DuraForce Ultra 5G UW in April 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Kyocera is back with a more subtly rugged (and more affordable) phone — the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW. If you want a sub-$600 rugged phone that works on Verizon’s millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G network, the DuraSport 5G UW is really your only choice. Roughly the size of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Google Pixel 5A with 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the DuraSport is small but strong: it’s dust, sand, and waterproof in up to 6.5 ft of water for 30 minutes (IP68), as well as MIL 810H-certified to survive five-foot drops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fyRyM"&gt;Underneath that toughness, the DuraSport is a sub-$300 phone at heart. It shares similar specs as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs"&gt;$239.99 OnePlus Nord N200 5G&lt;/a&gt;: they both use the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of internal storage. But the DuraSport has a smaller 4,500mAh battery and comes with some unique outdoor apps and camera features. This leads to the obvious question: is a budget rugged phone worth the premium, or are you better off getting a cheap 5G phone and adding a very protective case around it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mQRyhj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10954621"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Irpu2G5AQ1fM2aqWOGvUvsuIYeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100512/gsin_190401_4934_0001_cropped.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FceIkL"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="87ab7q"&gt;At a time when every new budget phone seems to be over 6.5 inches tall, the DuraSport is surprisingly compact. It’s similar to the Google Pixel 5A with 5G but thicker and slightly more narrow (6.09 x 2.78 x 0.39-inch or 154.7 x 70.7 x 9.9mm). They even look alike, with the same rounded corners and fingerprint sensor on the back — handy for unlocking the phone when you’re wearing a mask. This phone fits nicely in my small hands, and I can stuff it into most pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6x0Q5"&gt;For a phone built to survive the rigorous military-grade tests for dust, sand, water, and drop protection, the DuraSport’s design doesn’t scream rugged. Unlike its more expensive sibling, the DuraSport has normal dimensions and proportions. But it still obviates the need for a separate case: not only is its screen protected by Gorilla Glass 6, but it has reinforced corners, water-tight seams around its buttons, and a Dragontrail Glass over its rear cameras. Despite its extra bits of engineering, the Kyocera weighs about the same as the Pixel 5A. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/szgt5xhgFStySime-UT16E5-eCI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100514/gsin_190401_4934_0004_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport has some texture on its sides to help with grip, but it’s not very comfortable to hold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9A00JY"&gt;While the DuraSport’s hard plastic shell can withstand a lot of abuse, it’s not the most comfortable to hold. Kyocera added some light texture to its back cover and along the sides, but they don’t provide much substantial grip to the device. Not that this phone needs the extra protection, but a case would make the phone easier to hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwU83e"&gt;Among the many ways you can customize this phone, the most obvious is the programmable button on the left side. You can set it to open the exact camera mode you need in a hurry (underwater shutter button) or open a particular app if you double-press the button. I kept hitting the programmable button by accident because that’s where my thumb lands when I hold the phone; the actual power button is a bit too low for my liking. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/goH2npYLIBiyfmDpLl-sLeG10_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100518/gsin_190401_4934_0012_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included suite of outdoor apps can provide useful information, but they require constant access to your location, even when you’re not using them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FSjlj"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8pyQG8"&gt;Despite its mid-range price tag, the DuraSport has low-end internal components. Its processor is the budget-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 with 4GB of RAM, which makes the DuraSport just a beat slower to open a webpage or switch between portrait and landscape mode when watching a YouTube video. This was particularly evident when playing a round of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;, where the middle of a battle slowed to such a crawl that I couldn’t move my Pokémon out of the way to dodge an attack. While a sub-$300 phone can get away with just 64GB of storage, it’s mismatched to the DuraSport’s nearly $600 price tag, even if it has a microSD card slot for expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGZaCB"&gt;The DuraSport somewhat redeems itself with a 6.1-inch 1080p IPS LCD display that is quite bright (500 nits), making it possible to use the screen at just 60 percent brightness in direct sunlight. When you look at high-res photos like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/22829680/2021-art-illustrations-photography-verge-roundup"&gt;The Verge’s 2021: A Year in Art&lt;/a&gt;, the images look smooth and detailed even when you pixel-peep, thanks to this screen’s over 400PPI pixel density. Best of all, the touchscreen is functional when I’m wearing gloves or there is water on the screen, which is a huge help during winter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnFy7I"&gt;This phone is preloaded with apps for outdoor enthusiasts: an Outdoor Portal, Compass, Barometer, Sun&amp;amp;Moon, Weather, Tide (if you fish or have a boat), and Solunar (if you want to meet or avoid certain animals). In my case, I skate on an outdoor rink in the winter but am extremely picky about when I do so: the temperature needs to be at least 32 degrees or below the night before and throughout the day, with minimal wind, and after sunset so the ice has a chance to harden. I used the Outdoor Portal to monitor my local weather and sunset / sunrise data rather than cycle between multiple apps. While I appreciate the convenience of having these apps on my phone, I was not impressed that I had to give the apps non-stop access to my location, even though they said I could just limit the data collection to when I use the apps. If you don’t care to use these apps at all, you don’t have to worry about the location tracking, but they are a big part of the DuraSport’s selling points.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Za_0PTHZr5E8GrE4FGg5EUTFO3k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100513/gsin_190401_4934_0003_cropped.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The included outdoor apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WugW9L"&gt;Beyond these outdoor apps, the DuraSport essentially runs an unmodified version of Android 11. As one of the phones selected for the &lt;a href="https://androidenterprisepartners.withgoogle.com/device/#!/Atw0zjuq92nTHyfuwwaC"&gt;Android Enterprise Recommended&lt;/a&gt; program, Kyocera is already committed to providing quarterly security updates to the DuraSport until November 2023. This, along with the fact Kyocera provides two years of warranty, compared to the industry standard of just one year, means this phone should last you a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLv26q"&gt;The DuraSport’s 4,500mAh battery is actually quite energy-efficient and able to go without a charge after two days of use — and that’s from using mostly 4G LTE. After listening to a couple of hour-long podcasts, taking some photos and videos, posting and scrolling through social media, and reading various articles, I got about 15.5 hours of screen time out of the DuraSport over two days. Using the included charger, I was able to recharge the phone within 2.5 hours, which isn’t particularly fast. The DuraSport also lacks wireless charging — you have to step up to the Ultra model if you want that.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ge9x8YJkswhw_6oWgX2d-TQLTtc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100516/gsin_190401_4934_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DuraSport’s camera is budget-level, despite its mid-range price tag.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GcaNqZ"&gt;DuraSport 5G UW Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NdYqvf"&gt;Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re serious about photography, then you won’t like the cameras on the DuraSport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwh9GB"&gt;The phone has two cameras on the back, a 48-megapixel main and a 16-megapixel ultrawide, as well as an 8-megapixel front camera. The cameras take perfectly fine photos in good lighting conditions, but they’re not designed for anything challenging like low-light or action photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="14riyf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10988512"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NP3CMo"&gt;Its cameras share the same problems that plague other sub-$300 phones. Not only do the colors differ between the main and ultrawide camera, but the main camera also sometimes has trouble focusing and separating the subject from the background in portrait mode. I’ve also noticed that photos from low-light environments look as if there is vignetting around the edges — whether they were captured with the main, ultrawide, or selfie camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pyd2wN"&gt;The DuraSport tries to make up for its technical deficiencies with some unique video interfaces like the Action Overlay and beauty filters. (I did not have access to ANT Plus compatible fitness sensors, so I could not test the Action Overlay being linked to my fitness data in real-time.) Ultimately, it’s let down by a camera app that is slow at switching between cameras and will randomly close for no reason, which makes it frustrating to take photos with it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txzVUzQNArBSUldpMHGKeU1EaBk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23121642/gsin_190410_4934_0023.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kyocera DuraSport 5G UW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0eOIY"&gt;There is no doubt you’re paying a premium for the rugged design of the $579.99 DuraSport 5G UW — despite the fact it has cheap components that are more common in sub-$300 budget phones. It’s a shame it doesn’t use a faster processor or feature better cameras for a phone that is almost $600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvqoKv"&gt;There are plenty of other, better phones in this price range, including Google’s own Pixel 6. But if you’re looking for a rugged phone and want to use Verizon’s faster mmWave 5G network, the DuraSport is really the only budget rugged 5G phone available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsci4J"&gt;If having excellent cameras on your phone is more important to you, and you are willing to accept a water-resistant (IP67) rather than a waterproof one (IP68), then the $449 Pixel 5A with 5G would be a better choice. After all, they look and feel almost identical to each other, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okGCOQ"&gt;The peace of mind of having a phone that can handle serious spills and drops without needing to be replaced within a few years, thanks to Kyocera’s two-year warranty, is worthwhile, but most of us are better off just investing in a durable case for another phone.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter brings NFTs to the timeline as hexagon-shaped profile pictures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter NFT profile pictures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YEFh1Ul4rSgI6PGU7Y1NnVIRDeI=/66x0:1292x817/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70413202/twitter_nft_hex.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter NFT profile pictures&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Twitter.com&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0WEXJy"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22689806/twitter-bitcoin-lightning-tipping-nft-authentication"&gt;said in September&lt;/a&gt; that it would add a way for users to authenticate non-fungible tokens (NFT), and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226494708662273"&gt;now the feature is live&lt;/a&gt; — if you pay for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22766286/twitter-blue-subscription-service-scroll-nuzzel-undo-tweets-ad-free-articles-us"&gt;$2.99 Twitter Blue subscription&lt;/a&gt; and are using an iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jaqDlppdRPR0r8e0kb-WjRJ-wZ0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182610/twitter_nft.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Twitter animation showing the transition from regular profile picture to NFT-enabled soft hexagon" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EZyHXf9prLN8HoXNRjLlgpxxtpM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23182589/twitter_nft_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;aside id="dv2qfL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NFT fans say Twitter hasn’t solved the “right click save” problem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35T8tJ"&gt;On one hand, NFT profile pictures could be viewed as an incredible technology integration adding real utility for verified digital items. Alternately, it’s an unmissable signal pointing out the people that you should block or mute before they try to sell you some of their blockchain receipts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWXuT"&gt;No matter what your opinion of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22829383/matrix-nft-keanu-reeves-interview-carrie-ann-moss"&gt;easily reproduced&lt;/a&gt; digital trinkets is, Twitter is integrating them in a way that separates ridiculous images of cartoon apes that have been right-clicked for use as standard profile pictures from ridiculous images of cartoon apes that are connected to blockchain tokens by adding a special “soft hexagon” shape around them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwtH4B"&gt;At launch, Twitter is supporting several crypto wallets that users can connect to their profiles and verify that their tokens are of the non-fungible variety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="la8n6r"&gt;Argent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w7DhB0"&gt;Coinbase Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ld2BLx"&gt;Ledger Live&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yGHwCU"&gt;MetaMask&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sfF0Mi"&gt;Rainbow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2obJCp"&gt;Trust Wallet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="oh8au7"&gt;However, one side effect of limiting its interaction with the blockchain to a list of approved sources means that information on who owns what is not as decentralized as you may think. As researcher Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1484191510455533569?s=21"&gt;noted earlier Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, a database outage &lt;a href="https://status.opensea.io/incidents/88862t31ybw5"&gt;that knocked the OpenSea API offline for a few hours&lt;/a&gt; caused Twitter’s NFT collection pages to lose their information too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="0YV07O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;All due respect, that's not good enough. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part of what makes this feature important to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFTs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFTs&lt;/a&gt; is the ability to prove ownership at a glance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You've created a system that still allows people to right-click-save &amp;amp; benefit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Verified collections need to be marked ON the hexagon.&lt;/p&gt;— Adam Hollander (@HollanderAdam) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HollanderAdam/status/1484250493979353092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bXj2gZ"&gt;Despite Twitter’s list of wallets, there are people who think it isn’t doing enough to verify the provenance of NFTs. As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HollanderAdam/status/1484246971208642577"&gt;Adam Hollander points out&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter’s setup and hexagon logo only checks to see if there is an NFT connected to the user’s wallet — it doesn’t check or tell viewers if that NFT is verified as belonging to a high-profile collection (like the Bored Ape Yach Club, for example). You could go through the same right-click save exercise mentioned above, mint the image as a new NFT, and on your profile page, it will look identical to that of a person who has ownership of the verified image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6d0qyq"&gt;The only way someone can tell if your NFTs are actually from the collection that they appear to be is to click on your profile picture and check the details. Otherwise, a fake BAYC toke (&lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x9aa7b42dd0f716572c2d11f53c1206082f9bc987"&gt;like this one&lt;/a&gt;) looks at first glance just like the officially minted one (&lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter’s head of consumer product marketing Justin Taylor says this is on purpose, and that “We don’t want to limit this to just verified collections, that would be wrong, and non supportive of the broader nft movement. Anyone SHOULD be able to mint anything and make it their nft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="DIU8cn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XbC9Zv"&gt;&lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-blue-labs#nft"&gt;This FAQ explains the process&lt;/a&gt; (while trying to make sure NFT owners avoid clicking a phishing link instead of Twitter’s official ones, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22870912/nft-communities-boom-discord-hackers-cryptocurrency-webhooks"&gt;an all-too-frequent vector for NFT theft&lt;/a&gt;), and answers the question of what happens if you sell the NFT that’s in your picture. As it turns out, Twitter will continue to display the image, regardless of what the blockchain has to say about who owns it, however, it will revert to a common circle frame instead of the special crypto wallet-only hexagon shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sw6djT"&gt;If you see someone flashing one of these images and need to know more about their items, you can click on the hexagon profile pic. select ViewNFT details and find out information about the “NFT owner, NFT description, collection, properties, and additional details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TQLPK4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

Follow these simple steps to connect your crypto wallet and let’s see your NFT PFPs! &lt;a href="https://t.co/epSL7VXG5o"&gt;pic.twitter.com/epSL7VXG5o&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Blue (@TwitterBlue) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226540984356864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gyl8zG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 9:11AMET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about the verification, or lack thereof, for NFTs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak reveals Microsoft’s canceled Windows OS for dual-screen devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gkidiET_FLjl9Pgu5vFmUMqI7o=/91x0:1510x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415928/andromeda_os_screenshots_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RRFuQ1"&gt;Microsoft was working on a secret “pocketable” Surface device powered by a custom Windows OS before the company turned to Android for its Surface Duo. Codenamed Andromeda, the device appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17518582/microsoft-surface-dual-screen-andromeda-device-pocketable"&gt;leaked emails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16780124/microsoft-surface-notepad-foldable-tablet-hinge-rumors"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16553250/microsoft-surface-courier-device-rumors"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout various references to it in Microsoft’s Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VevZxw"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; has obtained&lt;/a&gt; an early test version of Andromeda OS running on a Lumia 950 to show just how close Microsoft got to launching a more modern successor to Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEnFn9"&gt;While Andromeda OS was never designed to ship on a Lumia 950, some Microsoft engineers used these devices to test parts of the operating system. As is typical for secret device development at many tech companies, not all engineers got access to prototype dual-screen hardware, but they still had to work on OS components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vA4xho12FfXqIEryP6gwkxYgM2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184378/andromeda_os_screenshots_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Central&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andromeda OS’ UI looked a lot like Windows Phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xeUvvp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;’s hands-on&lt;/a&gt; of Andromeda OS shows a very early version of what would have ultimately been a Windows Phone for dual-screen hardware. The lockscreen is clearly inspired by Windows Phone, with Cortana managing notifications. A big difference is the ability of the lockscreen to act as a giant canvas to take notes. No need to launch a separate notes app — just start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyWvmS"&gt;Even the home screen was another inking canvas, something Microsoft called Journal. This digital notebook supported inking, sticky notes, images, and 3D objects and was always instantly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9BblM3owRkLkZFkQ82jJLmpBFKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184383/andromedaos.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Central&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lockscreen was a giant canvas for inking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hftDqg"&gt;Elsewhere, there is early gesture support that clearly led to what eventually shipped on the Android-powered Surface Duo. Most of the early Andromeda OS UI looks like parts of what shipped with the Surface Duo or even ideas that went into Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjTw4h"&gt;Still, it’s interesting to look back at what could have been. Microsoft eventually canceled plans for Andromeda and Andromeda OS in favor of similar hardware that would be powered by Android. The software maker was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;working on Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, a larger dual-screen device powered by Windows 10X. That project ended with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;cancelation of Windows 10X last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks like Windows 11 will lead the way for any devices from OEMs that attempt to bring foldable or dual-screen hardware to life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Twitter could take NFTs mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdJw5LQCkGD1RzMd3aCSFbQfoks=/0x58:800x591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415810/twitter_nft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5zPl1"&gt;Today, just four months after announcing it was exploring the idea, Twitter began letting some people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twitterblue/status/1484226494708662273?s=21"&gt;use non-fungible tokens as their profile pictures&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers to the $2.99-a-month Twitter Blue service can now connect a crypto wallet, and display any NFTs they own in their profile. These users are easily distinguished from those yet to be crypto-pilled by the shape of their avatars: a hexagon, rather than the traditional circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfUmI6"&gt;In September, when Twitter first broached the idea, I suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-twitter-could-take-nfts-mainstream"&gt;the company’s adoption of NFTs could take the technology mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter users already invented the hashtag, the @ mention, and the retweet; by using profile pictures to display their (unauthenticated) NFTs already, I argued, owners of CryptoPunks, Bored Apes and other popular collections had invented the NFT profile. And now here it is, as an official Twitter product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcsJUU"&gt;In accordance with the polarizing nature of blockchain-based projects in general, Twitter’s introduction of NFT profiles was met with significant disdain. Recent criticism of NFTs has highlighted &lt;a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"&gt;the degree to which the technology does not live up to its own promises&lt;/a&gt;: of decentralizing power, or even of verifying ownership. (For the most part, NFTs today do not encode the owned media on the blockchain; rather, what is encoded is essentially a receipt for it.) Viewed through this lens, Twitter could be accused of legitimizing a technology that can leave people open to theft, scams, and other dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeZOv9"&gt;At the same time, millions of people are about to begin seeing those hexagons every day and wonder what the fuss is about. The question is whether Twitter — and all the other platforms racing to build NFT integrations — can brute-force digital collectibles into popularity, over the strident objections of critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKvMuG"&gt;As it so happens, we’ve had an early test of that question in the gaming industry. Over the past several months, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/15/technology/cryptocurrency-nft-gamers.html"&gt;several top developers have announced plans to integrate NFTs into their games, in the form of digital goods&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting stories generally include the phrase “massive backlash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0VkM"&gt;Gamers’ complaints are straightforward. The gaming industry has gradually shifted from a model of charging you a one-time fee to own a game to one in which you might be asked to pay for it multiple times (to download new expansions, or buy cosmetic items); or continuously (via subscriptions). Loot boxes, which award players items at random, introduced an expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56614281"&gt;much-hated form of pseudo-gambling&lt;/a&gt; into the gaming world. As a result, gamers often feel nickel-and-dimed by developers, without the games generally feeling more fun as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqsDun"&gt;The idea that playing a video game in the future might involve connecting a crypto wallet, paying steep fees just to transact on the marketplace, purchasing scarce digital goods, and then working to protect them from thieves — well, it’s not clear how that would make games much more fun, either. (One of my favorite YouTubers, the game critic SkillUp, now has a recurring feature about NFTs in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcyJSeTLtlzGRENniEdwxC2C6mXOXlcz"&gt;his weekly round-up of games news&lt;/a&gt;: it’s called “No Fucking Thanks.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3NdLn"&gt;And so &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/88880/after-backlash-ubisoft-calls-gaming-nfts-a-major-change-that-will-take-time"&gt;Ubisoft was roasted&lt;/a&gt; after announcing a plan to put NFTs into its shooter game &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt;. Square Enix, maker of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series and others, drew criticism for suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/square-enix-nft-backlash"&gt;it could “potentially” offer crypto tokens in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile gaming company Zynga seems to have avoided much backlash for&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/mobile-gaming-giant-zynga-pledges-eco-friendly-nfts-78420ca7-6fb5-483e-948f-bc55726be934.html"&gt; hiring a blockchain chief&lt;/a&gt;, but then Zynga games have been built on asking players to make constant, frustrating transactions &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-06/zynga-s-quest-for-big-spending-whales?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;from the start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uqSOYg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This fight will shape the metaverse conversation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4SMFm"&gt;For would-be operators of thriving NFT trading platforms, this backlash represents more than a series of negative public relations cycles. Silicon Valley’s collective vision of the next version of the internet, the one we have taken to calling the metaverse, hinges on video games as the thing that will lure the masses to buy augmented and virtual reality headsets. The basic idea, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg articulated to me last summer&lt;/a&gt;, is that you’ll buy virtual clothes or other digital goods as NFTs, and take them from VR experience to VR experience, starting with games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOcIAM"&gt;If players continue to hate the idea of NFTs forever, then, the metaverse will look very, very different. And developers that have raised funds at sky-high valuations based on the idea that games will bring billions of people onto web3, such as the team behind &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-axie-infinity-is-turning-gaming"&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mek5wj"&gt;It’s not just players who are skeptical. In a survey published today by the Game Developers Conference, 70 percent of studios said they have “no interest” in NFTs. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893216/gdc-annual-survey-2022-game-developers-nfts"&gt;Jay Peters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K4dmhX"&gt;“When asked how they felt about the possibility of cryptocurrency or NFTs in games, a few called it ‘the future of gaming,’” the survey said. “However, a vast majority of respondents spoke out against both practices — noting their potential for scams, overall monetization concerns, and the environmental impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVm5dq"&gt;Many quotes directly from developers were scathing. “How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me,” one wrote. “I’d rather not endorse burning a rainforest down to confirm someone ‘owns’ a jpeg,” said another. “Burn ‘em to the ground. Ban everyone involved in them. I work at an NFT company currently and am quitting to get away from it,” said another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EeCj3I"&gt;Of course, another way of reading this data is that almost one-third of game developers today say they are at least interested in NFT integrations. But for now, at least, they are in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnR2UX"&gt;All of which brings us back to the question of how these dynamics will play out on Twitter. There are some important differences between games and tweets: gamers hate NFTs in large part because they feel they fear they will be forced to buy them; on Twitter, buying and displaying any digital art that you purchase will be optional. And while the audience for video games numbers in the &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/gaming/a-marketers-guide-to-breaking-down-stereotypes-in-the-gaming-audience/"&gt;billions&lt;/a&gt; and defies easy categorization, I imagine Twitter’s diverse audience may have an even wider range of reactions to NFTs in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oR0STj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Crypto skeptics are dunking on hexagons; crypto enthusiasts are dunking on people mad at hexagons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8LpsRs"&gt;Today I saw reactions of two kinds: from crypto skeptics, dunking on hexagons; and, from crypto enthusiasts, dunking on people who are mad at hexagons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DK4cBq"&gt;Who will prevail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjjkR8"&gt;Sometimes, a technology is so reviled from the start that it is driven out of polite society. Ask anyone &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/seattle-dive-bar-becomes-first-to-ban-google-glass/"&gt;who wore Google Glass into a bar in 2013&lt;/a&gt; how that worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5L5UC"&gt;Other times, though — and this feels especially true on Twitter — things get ridiculed into legitimate popularity. (People who research extremism have a term for the way jokes are often used to smuggle ideas into the mainstream: &lt;a href="https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/INT_4981.html"&gt;irony poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.) And crypto enthusiasts have been masterful at co-opting insults hurled at them into badges of honor. When critics derided their art works as “JPEGs,” for example, the community quickly began using that term — with a wink — to refer to their collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBeGdn"&gt;If Twitter can’t take NFTs mainstream alone, it won’t be the last to try. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on Thursday that&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628"&gt; Meta plans to let people create and sell NFTs on its platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/google-forms-blockchain-group-under-newly-appointed-executive?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt; Google now officially has a blockchain team as well&lt;/a&gt;, and surely YouTube will fit into its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpT6Ob"&gt;It’s far too soon to gauge the prospects of any of these efforts, which remain in their earliest stages. But in the meantime, we may look back on Twitter’s hexagon launch as the day NFTs became accessible to a broad, mainstream audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jK6jeq"&gt;Now we wait to see whether the mainstream actually wants them.&lt;/p&gt;
