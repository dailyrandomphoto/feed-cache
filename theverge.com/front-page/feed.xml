    <title>Personal data of 533 million Facebook users leaks online </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Tzt1xO"&gt;Personal data from 533 million Facebook accounts has reportedly leaked online for free, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378314424239460352"&gt;security researcher Alon Gal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/stolen-data-of-533-million-facebook-users-leaked-online-2021-4?r=DE&amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; said it verified&lt;/a&gt; several of the leaked records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zxF8r"&gt;“The exposed data includes personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India,” according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and — in some cases — email addresses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMaCH2"&gt;If that 533 million number might sound familiar to you, that’s because this information is apparently from the same dataset that people could pay for portions of using a Telegram bot, which &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz7bd/facebook-phone-numbers-bot-telegram"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported on in January&lt;/a&gt;. Now, though, it appears that those who want to get their hands on the data won’t have to pay anything at all.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa0XL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Details include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Phone number, Facebook ID, Full name, Location, Past Location, Birthdate, (Sometimes) Email Address, Account Creation Date, Relationship Status, Bio.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bad actors will certainly use the information for social engineering, scamming, hacking and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;— Alon Gal (Under the Breach) (@UnderTheBreach) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UnderTheBreach/status/1378315550103863298?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NgsrQj"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that this data was scraped because of a vulnerability that it fixed in 2019. The company gave a similar answer to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; in January. “This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019,” &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/533-million-facebook-users-phone-numbers-leaked-on-hacker-forum/"&gt;Facebook told &lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We found and fixed this issue in August 2019.” Facebook has not replied to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZjYUy"&gt;Troy Hunt, the creator of the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned database&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378632650538188802"&gt;said on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that “I haven’t seen anything yet to suggest this breach isn’t legit.” In the data, he found only about 2.5 million unique email addresses (which is still a lot!), but apparently, “the greatest impact here is the phone numbers.” Here’s what that might mean, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485540425670657"&gt;in Hunt’s words&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LDNsOV"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;But for spam based on using phone number alone, it's gold. Not just SMS, there are heaps of services that just require a phone number these days and now there's hundreds of millions of them conveniently categorised by country with nice mail merge fields like name and gender.&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485999781613569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDRN6t"&gt;If you can, I strongly recommend taking a couple minutes to read &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378463581604220931"&gt;Hunt’s full Twitter thread about the breach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGZkM2"&gt;Hunt has already loaded the leaked email addresses into &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;Have I Been Pwned&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you can check to see if yours was included as part of the dataset. He is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378632650538188802"&gt;still considering&lt;/a&gt; whether or not to make the leaked phone numbers available through the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Ok5w0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Should the FB phone numbers be searchable in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@haveibeenpwned&lt;/a&gt;? I’m thinking through the pros and cons in terms of the value it adds to impacted people versus the risk presented if it’s used to help resolve numbers to identities (you’d still need the source data to do that).&lt;/p&gt;— Troy Hunt (@troyhunt) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378503918284460035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>The visual jazz of Genesis Noir</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N-iev1JXpAWFsAswkyEcWm_ACYg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69073896/GenesisNoir_MissMass.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pz6uhH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; is set at the start of existence, reimagining the Big Bang and the natural expansion of the universe as the violent end result of a love triangle gone wrong. It’s a marriage of jazz and film noir in a point-and-click adventure game that sometimes works better as an audiovisual plaything than it does a series of puzzles. But &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyvOoCZyWRQ"&gt;the game’s visual style&lt;/a&gt; is a clear standout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eahC4Q"&gt;The monochromatic, abstract, line-drawn look that makes &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; so unique comes from a host of influences: classic film, Italian literature, other indie games. The real mystery to solve was combining those ideas in a way that makes sense — and it actually ended in a playable game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0uiUy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Evan Anthony’s jumping-off point was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmicomics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cosmicomics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a collection of science-inspired short stories by Italian author Italo Calvino. “I think just initially I was trying to translate what I was envisioning when I was reading that book,” Anthony tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Calvino’s writing, even in the translation to English is “very visually rich storytelling,” Anthony says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SkrLUT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/26397024?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4fwKWp"&gt;Those ideas started solidifying into a style when Anthony and technical lead Jeremy Abel saw &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F26397024&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F4%2F22364576%2Fgenesis-noir-adventure-game-jazz-black-and-white-visuals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umbro Blackout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Made by &lt;a href="https://buck.co/"&gt;Buck&lt;/a&gt;, a creative studio specializing in animation, &lt;em&gt;Umbro Blackout&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of a soccer player visiting New York during the blackout of 1977. “It’s just very simple black-and-white graphics. I wanted to bring that kind of clever transitions and juxtaposition of settings and scenes into an interactive space,” Anthony remembers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPHfVv"&gt;The actual genesis of &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir &lt;/em&gt;started&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on newsprint paper. Anthony and Abel sketched the early character designs that would become &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir’&lt;/em&gt;s initial trio of film noir archetypes — turned “gods” in the language of the game — in charcoal. They’d go on to become No-Man, the player character and a manifestation of Time; Miss Mass, a jazz singer femme fatale and representation of gravity; and Golden Boy, a star saxophonist and sort of creator god whose attempt to murder Miss Mass sets off the events of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeybuB"&gt;Indie games served as guidance for Anthony and Abel as well, neither of whom had a background in games or designed a level before. You can find some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083368/kentucky-route-zero-act-v-review-pc-switch-ps4-xbox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kentucky Route Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt;’s interactions, fixed perspectives, and transitions between scenes. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18642356/kids-game-android-iphone-steam-double-fine-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kids&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the short film / video game hybrid from 2019, was also a big north star for doing a lot with a little. “[&lt;em&gt;Kids&lt;/em&gt;] was definitely a great reference in like what you could do with one asset,” Anthony says. “Like how we can be economical, very economical with the assets that we have,” Abel continues.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G8-d0hmX56K0BqqMgFYAktbJOxA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416842/40761846_cc94_44f6_9cac_028e34cf2623.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Time and memories repeat in &lt;/em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;em&gt; — infinitely. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uils72"&gt;Even though both Abel and Anthony had embarked on some ambitious creative projects before — notably, &lt;a href="http://jeremyabel.com/portfolio/google-maps-pinball/"&gt;a Google Maps pinball machine&lt;/a&gt; for Google — the visuals of &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; were a different beast. They realized that game engines aren’t really designed with hyper-stylized visuals in mind. “There’s a reason why games don’t really look like this,” Anthony says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhlkjQ"&gt;Some of that difficulty admittedly came from the pair’s inexperience and the abstract direction they decided to take the game. One early level called “Seeding,” set in the first microseconds of the Big Bang, had to be reworked multiple times from Anthony’s initial idea of a level made from “vibrating lines and strings.” Creating a level of wobbling lines that could not only run, but players would actually want to explore, was a hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SY8VceCaXJ4YopfbD_XkTrQUWQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416893/Screen_Shot_2021_04_02_at_1.00.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Feral Cat Den&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Planting seeds in the first microseconds of the Big Bang.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IhClae"&gt;According to Abel, the biggest technical considerations they had to manage were performance and translating the art Anthony was creating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/31/22208190/adobe-flash-is-dead"&gt;Flash&lt;/a&gt; to the game’s engine. On some platforms like the Switch, that meant adapting and faking some visual effects. For the 2D animations themselves, Abel also had to create more bespoke solutions. “I worked with a friend of mine to develop a solution to actually export all the animations from Flash and draw them as vector art in the engine,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZwZ7C"&gt;Anthony and Abel’s multiyear journey to create &lt;em&gt;Genesis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Noir&lt;/em&gt; provided them with some valuable lessons in design and a delightful finished product.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Even if you don’t relate to the variety of sources &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; is pulling from, playing the game really captures the feeling of an interactive animated film. And the goal of expressing big, abstract concepts with a familiar genre and setting pays dividends, too. I won’t spoil where &lt;em&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/em&gt; goes in its final levels, but there’s more here than science facts and noir story beats. “I think my goal was to find some poetry between comparing two very disparate things,” Anthony says. “I’m very happy with how everyone’s perceived it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MWD9ny"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Genesis Noir&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available now on PC, Xbox Game Pass, and Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmdVZR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCGzQt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s latest Gram 17 makes a stellar case for 17-inch laptops</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;More good stuff, same light weight&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nrSiVY"&gt;I’ve read plenty about what it’s like to use, hold, and type on an LG Gram before, but that didn’t take away from the impressive first impression it made when I used the new Gram 17 for the first time — especially this larger model. The Gram 17 has a grandiose 17-inch display, yet it’s only three pounds, which is light enough for me to carry around one-handed. Its keyboard is a joy to type on with a surprising amount of tactility and travel in the keys, and the battery life outlasts a whole day of work, even much of a second one, too. It’s a quiet laptop, and even under pressure, its fans weren’t loud enough for me to hear once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRW2rK"&gt;The Gram communicates its biggest selling points — lightness and longevity — &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;effectively that it outshines some persisting minor problems. Those include a keyboard layout that can be difficult to adjust to. For instance, the num lock is too easy to press accidentally, being right next to backspace, and the only function key is located too far away from the most essential function row buttons, making it a stretch to adjust the volume one-handed. Lastly, the large trackpad isn’t always good at palm rejection. These are important things for any laptop to get right, let alone one that has a bunch of extra real estate that should be used to avoid flaws like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4suZ2k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10426094"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wsxyAh"&gt;This new model for 2021 is mostly a spec update, not a design overhaul compared to the 2020 version. But it’s a good update, at that. Inside of LG’s sole $1,799 Gram 17 configuration (it’s been available for $1,699 since late March), there’s now an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 quad-core processor that promises — and actually delivers — better performance and longer battery life than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21310392/lg-gram-17-review-display-weight-specs-price-features"&gt;the 2020 model my colleague Monica Chin reviewed&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, this model’s faster 4,266MHz LPDDR4X RAM, of which it has 16GB, likely plays a role in that speed boost. It’s not a drastically different computer to use than before, but it can hold its own more reliably this time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nIEimWOnP5ErqlcRDoTwQucHQcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411711/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG packed in a lot of keys here, but it’s not as logically laid out as it could be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1r1PpW-MKtRNmU0AkgOtCBg-80=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411719/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen’s large size and 16:10 aspect ratio give content a lot of room to breathe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4KZGFe"&gt;While running my usual collection of around 10 tabs in Microsoft Edge for work, with Slack and Spotify running in tandem, performance didn’t stutter at all. This is the bare minimum of competency tests for laptops, so for something more demanding, I exported a five-minute, 33-second test file from our &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;video team through Adobe Premiere Pro. Last year’s model took 30 minutes to do this, but this one gets it done in around 11 minutes. That doesn’t hold a candle to laptops that put more of an emphasis on power usually at the expense of heft, but it’s enough of an improvement to make the Gram 17’s price a little easier to justify. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer’s Book 13&lt;/a&gt; with the same processor fared just about a minute faster with this test, but the Gram is on par with the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21494523/asus-zenbook-14-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ZenBook 14&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="O7Bw2F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10426049"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDFcr3"&gt;The battery is also mystifyingly good — and better than before. With that same batch of apps I mentioned earlier, the Gram 17 lasted an entire workday and well into the next, around 12 or so hours later. If you’re looking for a laptop that can go a full day of work without its charger, whether you have video calls or not, this is one for your shortlist. It features the same 80Wh battery as last year’s model, which is still impressive considering the Gram 17’s lightweight profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2ZRTY"&gt;Also similar to the 2020 version is its USB-C charging. LG now includes a 65W USB-C power adapter instead of the 48W charger that shipped with the previous model. It can more quickly recharge with the included brick (which is no bigger than a compact power bank), but it still takes a few hours to refill it completely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TgmvLS"&gt;That sums up the biggest changes to this year’s Gram 17. There are a few smaller tweaks I liked, too. The arrangement of ports has been shifted around in a more logical layout. On the left side, there’s a Thunderbolt 4 port (it can be used for charging, data, or connecting to a display), one USB-C 4.0 Gen 3 port, a headphone combo jack, and an HDMI port. Over on the right is where you’ll find two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 2 ports next to a microSD card slot and a Kensington lock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NaLLSO"&gt;If you’re shopping around for 17-inch laptops, you’ll be hard-pressed to find anything lighter than the Gram. It’s 2.98 pounds, which is just a little heavier than the 13-inch MacBook Air. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt; is one of LG’s main competitors in this space, yet its baseline model weighs over a pound and a half more. If you get an XPS 17 model like the one we reviewed in July 2020, it’ll weigh almost as much as two Gram 17s at 5.53 pounds. That added weight does bring more power and a dedicated GPU in the Dell, but if you just want a big, portable screen for productivity, the Gram is more than capable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMl6yk"&gt;As my colleague Monica Chin mentioned in her review of the 2020 LG Gram 17, this laptop isn’t a looker. It still doesn’t stack up next to the high-end design of the XPS 17, which features an aluminum chassis. The Gram has a tough magnesium alloy-clad body, but it looks and feels plasticky. That said, there’s technically nothing flawed about its design, and it seems better than most black aluminum laptops I’ve tried at resisting fingerprints. Some people might actually prefer that its design doesn’t stick out much, even when its backlit keyboard is on.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 720p webcam produces a fuzzy image, but it’s serviceable quality.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vZHdHB"&gt;Something minor that I wish LG offered with this model is the option for a matte display. It’s rare for ultrabooks to have them, but I find it hard to stay focused on what’s happening on the screen when I can see a reflection of all my apartment’s happenings staring back at me. Wherever you use this laptop, glare could be a big problem, like it can be with a TV. This doesn’t take away from the Gram 17’s display being sharp and vivid. It’s a WQXGA (2560 x 1600) IPS non-touch panel from the company’s own display division, and it makes everything look excellent with 99 percent DCI-P3 color gamut coverage. If a touchscreen is important to you, LG’s Gram 2-in-1 laptops feature them. LG was one of the first Windows laptop makers to move to a 16:10 aspect ratio, and the Gram 17 has one, too. It gives you a little more vertical real estate to work with on the screen compared to 16:9 displays. It’s most beneficial for productivity (you see more info at once, so less scrolling is necessary), but you’ll have black letterboxing for most full-screen videos you watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8SE7y"&gt;The Gram is short on bloatware, which I love to see. It ships with Amazon’s Alexa built-in, though it requires activation before you can use the service. A few other preinstalled apps include McAfee LiveScan and a suite of creator tools from CyberLink. Compared to some other laptops I’ve used recently, like Acer’s Predator Triton 300 SE, the Gram doesn’t shove pop-up notifications in your face seemingly every time you use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I7aSxJQnZ95qQoKiXNhlIh2PDXA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411715/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have a 1.6mm travel and feel tactile to type on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="LG Gram 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_6RILWU4VY2U4LGX1Oazof_F5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22411708/cfaulkner_20210326_4491_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design of the Gram doesn’t stand out, but some people might like that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykJ77R"&gt;There are few 17-inch laptops to choose from and even fewer models that are as lightweight as this one. This year’s LG Gram 17 is unique in the sense that it’s more powerful than ever, but it doesn’t give up its portability. Oddly enough, the only competition it faces at the moment comes from within LG. The 16-inch Gram is lighter and less expensive, yet it features the same design, screen size, port selection, battery capacity, and specs (aside from having significantly less storage) for $1,399. You can find one that has the same 1TB storage as the Gram 17 for $1,599. If the Gram 17’s $1,799 price is too expensive, at least you have an alternative that’ll likely deliver the same great results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCYHXn"&gt;But if the price isn’t an issue and you want a surprisingly portable and powerful laptop with an oversized screen, the Gram 17 is in a class of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4plfai"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10426073"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Hummer’s new electric SUV can drive diagonally, with 300 miles of range and a $110,000 price tag</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6Njh_wOktyCwVK7JEuiufSpAnI=/99x0:1169x713/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072830/hummer_ev_reveal_suv_gal_my23_hummer_suv_VP33__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UVTAkg"&gt;Hummer has unveiled the SUV version of its electric pickup truck, which comes with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;up to 300 miles of range and will sell for a suggested retail price of up to $110,595 for its first edition. Reservations for that model are already full, according &lt;a href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev"&gt;to GM’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnjmLm"&gt;GM, which is producing the electric Hummers under its GMC brand, said the SUV will go into production starting early 2023, with less pricey variants starting at $90,000 in the spring of 2023 and a low-end $80,000 variant with a 250-mile range in the spring of 2024.  Previously, the company said that its electric pickup truck will start assembly at the end of 2021, starting with the most expensive trim level. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rJJZ7S5FtPxqFK9zifiZoLlIFEE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419232/hummer_ev_suv.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2CfLQb"&gt;Like the pickup, the SUV’s $90K-and-up trim levels come with Crab Walk, which can let the Hummer rotate all four wheels to drive diagonally at low speeds, and Extract Mode, which can use the air suspension system to lift the entire vehicle six inches off the ground to get over large obstacles. It’s also got the same 13.4-inch touchscreen center console display, and 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/woCOjPpT-MJKTaZJ6lDyNTySs-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419199/hummer_ev_suv_trim_levels.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hummer EV SUV trim levels; you can find a more detailed comparo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gmc.com/electric/hummer-ev/suvs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;at GM’s site&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4gEMMP"&gt;GM retired the Hummer brand in 2010. At the time, the boxy behemoth had become a symbol for pre-financial-crisis excess that was made famous by its inclusion in rap videos and television shows like &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Entourage&lt;/em&gt;. But once the global recession hit, and fuel prices stared to rise, Hummer sales dropped and the vehicle was discontinued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A4UEGc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10428065"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="spFypm"&gt;Last year, the company announced it was reviving the nameplate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;as an outrageous, 1,000 horsepower battery-powered pickup truck that can raise and lower its suspension six inches and even drive diagonally&lt;/a&gt;. The Hummer is a cornerstone of GM’s $27 billion push into EVs that will include the release of 30 new vehicles by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQgIkW"&gt;Both Hummers will be among the first vehicles built on GM’s new modular electric battery platform, Ultium, which the company says will deliver power ranging from 50 to 200 kWh, allowing for a driving range up to “400 miles or more.” For trucks, the Ultium platform will include 800-volt battery packs and 350 kW fast-charging capability, equivalent to a 100-mile charge in 10 minutes according to GM; for the SUV, fast charging is limited to 300 kW, and with 170 fewer horsepower at top spec, you’re also looking at 3.5 seconds to go from 0-60, rather than a flat 3.0 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkuBFk"&gt;The vehicles will also feature the second-generation version of GM’s advanced driver assist system, Super Cruise, that allows for “hands-free” highway driving.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam survey suggests Nvidia’s RTX 3070 is actually trickling into the hands of gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E1Eg_3FntlVA5Tsteg-2FEoRdjw=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072667/twarren_201025_4262_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FJD1pF"&gt;Now that the street price of an Nvidia RTX 3070 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;is over $1,200&lt;/a&gt;, it’s temping to think scalpers, bots and cryptocurrency miners got them all — but &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/?sort=pct"&gt;the latest Steam Hardware Survey&lt;/a&gt; suggests at least some of them are making their way into gaming PCs, too. &lt;a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/89161-latest-steam-survey-rtx-3070-month-top-performer.html%5C"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;TechSpot&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, the 3070 in particular appears to have become Steam’s fastest growing GPU, and the 17th-most popular graphics accelerator on Steam with a 1.29 percent share overall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDnoHZ5QcnHtNvbOjJKL3-m90MY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419138/top_20_gpus_steam_march_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top 20 GPUs on Steam, as of March 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CO7pls"&gt;The RTX 3080 also commands 0.87 percent, the RTX 3060 Ti has 0.39 percent, and the pricey RTX 3090 claims 0.34 percent of the market — for a total of 2.89 percent Ampere cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcj71q"&gt;That not bad, especially considering AMD’s rival RX 6000 series doesn’t have a single spot on the entire 95-GPU leaderboard. Apparently, more gamers are using the 2011 Nvidia GeForce GTX 550 Ti (0.16 percent) than any of AMD’s latest cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XRspTo"&gt;More than a quarter of Steam PC gamers are now using AMD CPUs instead of Intel, though, so that’s probably some consolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wGQzUL"&gt;If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;secondhand sales numbers&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, I would expect the newer RTX 3060 to contribute to Nvidia’s tally next month. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump used dark patterns to trick supporters into donating millions more than intended</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Patterns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7GMfcXrEEtMtkJOChXeaNZqKUE=/34x0:1066x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072501/ui_static.1419979789.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Patterns are user interfaces designed to trick you into doing what their creator wants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eebykq"&gt;When Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he didn’t stop asking his supporters for money. The emails kept coming in. But by the end of his four years in office, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html"&gt;a new report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, they had begun to look an awful lot like a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8kEtk"&gt;By June 2020, the Trump campaign had begun using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, computer interfaces designed to trick users, to automatically sign up campaign contributors to donate far more money than they had intended — recurring monthly donations, recurring weekly donations, even a one-time surprise “money bomb” per month — by &lt;em&gt;pre-checking&lt;/em&gt; the checkboxes for each option, burying the fine print under paragraphs of bold text, and forcing his supporters to wade through it all and opt out if they wanted to make a simple donation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G71y3D"&gt;Here’s how bad it got as of October, according to the NYT:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Tu5ll0vlLnMymfE0MU05vbUZk5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22419046/oakImage_1614036252373_jumbo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6U81eL"&gt;One Kansas City supporter who donated $500 saw his account tapped for $3,000 that month. Another realized their $990 donation had become $8,000. Banks and a major credit card company told the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that dealing with fraud claims for WinRed, the conservative fundraising site processing these payments, had started to become a significant percentage of their daily workload. A Trump spokeperson admitted at least $19.7 million worth of its transactions had been disputed. And those are just from people who bothered to dispute the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgkqDm"&gt;There’s far more in &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/03/us/politics/trump-donations.html"&gt;the full story&lt;/a&gt;, like how WinRed pocketed $5 million worth of payment processing fees from those who asked for refunds, but the good news is that maybe, just maybe, people are finally waking up to the dangers that dark patterns pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lZNFJE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feds are paying attention to dark patterns now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bFrTMK"&gt;California just passed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333506/california-bans-dark-patterns-opt-out-selling-data"&gt;a landmark privacy bill banning dark patterns&lt;/a&gt; last month. Washington state is attempting one as well. Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA), Deb Fischer (R-NE) and Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) are planning to reintroduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18302199/big-tech-dark-patterns-senate-bill-detour-act-facebook-google-amazon-twitter"&gt;the DETOUR Act&lt;/a&gt; in the next congressional session, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy"&gt;according to our sister site &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; spoke to acting FTC chair Rebecca Slaughter about her plans to address dark patterns as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3dwhwf"&gt;In the meanwhile, you’ll find dark patterns wherever you look on the web, perhaps nowhere more prominently than the privacy warnings you’ll find on every website you visit these days that warn you about the cookies they collect, in order to comply &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;with EU privacy laws&lt;/a&gt;. In far too many cases, there’s no obvious way to opt out of that data collection — instead, there’s a nice bright button that you can press to just give up your data and move on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6VjEq"&gt;UX designer and consultant Harry Brignull coined the phrase “dark patterns” in 2010. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;Here’s the guest post he wrote for us in 2013.&lt;/a&gt; And if you want to laugh and cry at the same time, I highly recommend playing &lt;a href="https://userinyerface.com/game.html"&gt;the free, short online game &lt;em&gt;User Inyerface&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a master class in horrific UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber will pay a blind woman $1.1 million after drivers stranded her 14 times</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nxYPkK95p7j9esBYRRx8Q0aHkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69072148/akrales_181010_3013_0148.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rRKvDR"&gt;Uber was sued in 2014 for discriminating against blind people and their guide dogs, and agreed to change that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/30/11543922/uber-blind-customers-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;as part of a $2.6 million settlement&lt;/a&gt; two years later. But apparently, that didn’t entirely happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC7oPa"&gt;Uber will now pay an additional $1.1 million to a blind woman who says said she missed work, missed her birthday celebration, missed Christmas Eve church services, and was left out in the dark, in the rain, and other such humiliations because Uber drivers refused to carry her and her dog on 14 different occasions — a number of which happened &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Uber &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/ubers-settlement-with-blind-users-finalized/"&gt;finalized its 2016 settlement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjyLSi"&gt;“Uber allowed drivers who discriminated against disabled riders to continue driving without discipline,” an arbitrator concluded this week (via &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-drivers-refused-rides-to-this-blind-woman-16068416.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vqZI7y"&gt;This line from the arbitrator’s report is also worth considering: “When Uber did conduct an investigation, its investigators were trained, in some instances, to coach drivers to find non-discriminatory reasons for ride denials, sometimes even to ‘advocate’ to keep drivers on the platform despite discrimination complaints.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZlfOY"&gt;Lisa Irving, the woman, isn’t suddenly a millionaire, by the way. The arbitrator awarded her $324,000 in damages, with the rest ($805,313) going to legal costs, including attorney fees. &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Uber-drivers-refused-rides-to-this-blind-woman-16068416.php"&gt;She spoke to the &lt;em&gt;Chronicle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about her dog and her memories, including one where a driver &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; pick her up, then got vocally angry about having a dog in the car and threatened to leave them on the side of the road. She says she was rejected at least 60 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEY3gQ"&gt;Uber now has &lt;a href="https://help.uber.com/riders/article/i-want-to-report-a-service-animal-issue-?nodeId=5f3eac46-e977-44a0-873e-f1881d48f4cb"&gt;a dedicated support form&lt;/a&gt; for issues with service animals. “Was a service animal denied?” is the very first question. Here’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Flegal%2Fen%2Fdocument%2F%3Fname%3Dservice-animal-policy%26country%3Dunited-states%26lang%3Den&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F3%2F22365859%2Fuber-blind-woman-win-arbitration-lisa-irving-guide-dog" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber’s service animal policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A cable company that prided itself on no data caps says you’re getting data caps because pizza</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQNuCJTfep6nKNxtZxdU5q_ERSE=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071819/L1030389.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8AeC1"&gt;Internet data caps are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; like pizza — where taking a slice could mean fewer slices for everyone else. I don’t think &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers have trouble understanding this concept? It’s been well-established that ISPs have no trouble delivering unlimited data, even during — say — a global pandemic when vast throngs of the population have suddenly found themselves working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="galMAG"&gt;This, however, did&lt;em&gt; not &lt;/em&gt;stop WideOpenWest (aka WOW!) from using pizza to justify brand-new, possibly-never-before-seen data caps for its cable internet subscribers, starting June 1st, 2021, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/04/internet-data-is-like-pizza-cable-company-claims-as-it-imposes-data-cap/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecFjFy"&gt;Here’s a portion of the email subscribers are receiving:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NPOtLT"&gt;What’s a monthly data usage plan? Let us illustrate …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvMkd5"&gt;Imagine that the WOW! network is a pizza. Piping hot. Toppings galore. Every WOW! customer gets their own slice of pizza, but the size of their slice is dependent on their Internet service plan. While customers who subscribe to 1 Gig get the largest slices, those with Internet 500 get a slightly smaller piece, and so on. But, it’s all the same delicious, high-speed pizza that you know and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JBg2"&gt;Now, say you’re not full after your slice and you grab another. That extra slice is like a data overage. Don’t worry—we got extra pizza... umm, data... just in case. If you exceed your data allowance, we’ll automatically apply increments of 50GB for $10 to your account for the remainder of the current calendar month. Total overage charges will not exceed $50 per billing statement no matter how much data you use. Even better—the first time you experience a data overage, we’ll &lt;strong&gt;proactively waive fees&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="y6o4J4"&gt;To explain how nonsensical that is, here’s a paragraph from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a story I wrote late last year&lt;/a&gt; which I think you might enjoy reading as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AXhsvX"&gt;Forget for a moment that Comcast itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/2015/11/7/9687976/comcast-data-caps-are-not-about-fixing-network-congestion"&gt;was caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; explaining that data caps have nothing to do with network congestion. Forget that the CEOs of several smaller ISPs &lt;a href="https://money.com/internet-data-caps-bogus-ploys/"&gt;have admitted that internet capacity is anything but scarce&lt;/a&gt;. Forget that Comcast &lt;em&gt;disabled its own congestion management system&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/06/comcast-says-it-doesnt-throttle-heaviest-internet-users-anymore/"&gt;because it found it was unnecessary&lt;/a&gt;. Forget even that Comcast is a wildly profitable company whose cable division spends &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/news-releases/news-release-details/comcast-reports-4th-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;only a tenth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of its yearly revenues on keeping that network strong. The proof that data caps are a swindle is something you probably witnessed yourself earlier this year: Comcast, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179330/comcast-t-mobile-coronavirus-data-caps-hotspots-fcc"&gt;suspended their data caps&lt;/a&gt; when the pandemic hit, and the internet kept on working without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="87o5kX"&gt;The kicker here is that WOW knows full well its network is nothing like pizza — because for years, including during the pandemic, the company proudly boasted that it &lt;em&gt;didn’t &lt;/em&gt;have a data cap. It was &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;reason to pick WOW over Comcast, one subscriber told &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L4dYv4"&gt;Some evidence:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ybb6e4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“No data caps” means unlimited access to your world. As a WOW! Internet customer, you are not limited by data caps. In times like these, it’s important that you have this benefit so you never have to worry about data usage - and it’s already included with WOW! Internet. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WOWWay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WOWWay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JkdMapzGAr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JkdMapzGAr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WOW!

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6C8xoi"&gt;To which I say: wow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71ru0Z"&gt;What would cause WOW to abandon its values for profit? I can’t say for sure, but I’d hazard a guess it might have been emboldened by Comcast’s recent decision to make data caps the norm across the United States starting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;&lt;s&gt;March&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;&lt;s&gt;July&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291469/comcast-delays-northeast-data-cap-rollout-2022"&gt;sometime next year&lt;/a&gt;. Because that’s the state of internet “competition” in the United States: so few real choices that when one ISP turns up the profits, it’s probably safe for neighboring ISPs to do same. If you’re locked into just one or two bad choices where you live, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;I’d recommend telling the FCC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ultimate Lego Star Wars game has been delayed again, indefinitely, and that’s OK</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5HQHX7AnJOU1UBCWUR8fIuyrse4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69071596/Lego_Star_Wars.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bj897V"&gt;If you’ve been eagerly waiting for &lt;a href="https://www.starwars.com/games-apps/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to fulfill the incredible promise of its stirring trailer from last August (see above), I have some bittersweet news: the game’s been delayed again. Developer TT Games &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTGames/status/1377984167233744899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1377984167233744899%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eurogamer.net%2Farticles%2F2021-04-03-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-delayed-again"&gt;tweeted on Friday &lt;/a&gt;that “we won’t be able to make our intended Spring release date,” &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-08-28-slipped-to-2021-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-has"&gt;which itself was a delay&lt;/a&gt; from the game’s original 2020 launch window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sVPjxi"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thanks to all our fans for your continued patience. &lt;a href="https://t.co/tCDV9Ikftd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tCDV9Ikftd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— TT Games (@TTGames) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TTGames/status/1377984167233744899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vcolcH"&gt;Bittersweet, because the delay does come with the promise that it’ll be the company’s “biggest and best-ever LEGO game,” which is exactly what that trailer looked like last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1QDX1"&gt;It’s been sixteen years since the first &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars, &lt;/em&gt;and I can certainly wait a bit longer if there’s a chance of achieving that goal. We’ve seen far too many games shoved out before they were ready, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;I can think of at least one notable reason&lt;/a&gt; any developer might need a bit more time now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSLwEk"&gt;It may mean &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538464/ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-games-list-new-release-holiday-2020-2021"&gt;one fewer game for new PS5 and Xbox Series X / S buyers&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of their new consoles in the short term, though. (It’s coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One and PC as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62XQID"&gt;There’s no new release date for &lt;em&gt;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga &lt;/em&gt;yet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtSOu5"&gt;Since 1996, &lt;a href="http://spacejam.com"&gt;spacejam.com&lt;/a&gt; has been an internet time capsule &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/20/4245466/how-space-jam-proves-the-internet-is-a-time-capsule"&gt;like few others still in existence&lt;/a&gt; — a largely pristine sample of the early World Wide Web and all the most advanced multimedia offerings available at the time, such as animated GIFs and Windows 95 screensavers. But 25 years later, it’s finally been supplanted; the new sequel &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy, &lt;/em&gt;starring LeBron James, has taken over the URL to showcase the new movie’s very first trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Coh2aJ"&gt;Here’s what spacejam.com looks like today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j6i-awVduqBS3IyD9gQLyPUM-r0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22418492/chrome_j0GOqtMX2b.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CAFEXX"&gt;But before you go boycotting the sequel, you should probably know that the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website isn’t dead yet. In fact, it’s just one click away at &lt;a href="https://www.spacejam.com/1996"&gt;spacejam.com/1996&lt;/a&gt;, and the new website lets you that original Space Jam logo (in the upper-right-hand corner) to go back in time again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OftbiL"&gt;Here’s that new trailer for the LeBron James version — featuring both a cartoon LeBron James, and upscaled CGI versions of the Looney Toons crew as well. Looks like they’ll be breaking into the real world once again! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R9CcaH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/olXYZOsXw_o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HmNH5y"&gt;Will LeBron go Googling for the original &lt;em&gt;Space Jam&lt;/em&gt; website in the film (or, perhaps, will Daffy or Bugs remark that it’s still there?) I think it’s a safe bet. It’ll arrive on July 16th in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;and HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
