    <title>Google says bug with Teams and Android can cause 911 calls to fail</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wufCfX"&gt;Last week, a Reddit user reported that they &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/"&gt;weren’t able to call 911 using their Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt; and later said they were working with Google support to figure out the issue. Yesterday, Google &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/r4xz1f/pixel_prevented_me_from_calling_911/hnrvsr1/"&gt;announced what was causing the issue&lt;/a&gt; in a reply to the post: an “unintended interaction between the Microsoft Teams app and the underlying Android operating system” (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/12/08/android-emergency-calling-bug/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Auq1G4"&gt;In its comment, Google says that the bug happens when someone is using Android 10 or later and has Teams installed but isn’t logged into the app. The company says that Microsoft will be releasing an update to Teams “soon” to prevent the issue and that there’s an update to Android coming January 4th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vur50g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you’re running Android 10 or above and aren’t logged into Teams, uninstall it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fhvf9I"&gt;Needless to say, you should uninstall Teams until the update is available if you’re not planning on logging into the app. If you have logged into it at one point but don’t use it frequently, you should also go ahead and double-check that you’re still logged in as well. Even though the bug was reported on the Pixel subreddit, Google recommends that you should keep an eye out for the Teams update if you have “any Android device” running Android 10 or up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRVGVP"&gt;As many commenters pointed out, it’s a bit concerning that any app can make it so you can’t contact emergency services. Google does say it’s only received one report about this bug, but it’s a pretty niche set of circumstances that cause the bug (there’s really no reason to have Teams installed if you’re not logged into it). If it had been a more common interaction, it could’ve really caused problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMzSr5"&gt;Google says it’ll update its Reddit comment when the Teams update is rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Utility companies will no longer share data with ICE — but many loopholes remain </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jcMuc42XqnKrHFw6ecX__xRvhUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250777/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="87VqSj"&gt;A nationwide group of companies from the power, water, cable TV, and telecommunications sectors have agreed that they will no longer sell customer information to data brokers used by ICE and law enforcement agencies. The news has been hailed as an important step by privacy advocates, who have long criticized the practice as a privacy violation that lets law enforcement obtain personal information from third parties without appropriate review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZJwRJ"&gt;The announcement comes from a letter sent Wednesday by Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/08/utility-data-government-tracking/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0rFOr"&gt;The companies concerned belong to the National Consumer Telecom &amp;amp; Utilities Exchange (NCTUE), a credit reporting agency that lets members log the payment histories of their customers in a shared central database. This data was then shared with credit bureau Equifax, which uses such payment information records in credit score reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0kiOEO"&gt;However, the same data was then resold by Equifax to &lt;a href="https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/clear-investigation-software"&gt;CLEAR&lt;/a&gt; — an extensive database of personal information that was used by ICE investigators, as &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/26/ice-private-utility-data/"&gt;reported by the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZXIvw"&gt;According to the letter sent by Sen. Wyden, the NCTUE directed Equifax to stop selling data to CLEAR as of October 2021. However, any customer data in the database before this point will remain accessible and includes some information — such as dates of birth and Social Security numbers — that will not change over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Mw28R"&gt;Wyden’s letter asks the CFPB to prevent credit agencies from selling personal data to law enforcement agencies via data brokers — a practice that the senator has campaigned against for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gc39wI"&gt;“Every branch of government has ignored the corrosive effect of data brokers for decades,” said Sen. Wyden in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Investigations by journalists, researchers and my office have finally shined a light on just how widespread the sale of Americans private data is. I’ve told anyone who will listen that Congress’s top tech priority should be passing strong legislation to protect Americans’ privacy and security. I hope Democrats don’t pass on the chance to put privacy protections into black letter law until it’s too late.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0USFlj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rrv9Tb"&gt;The use of data obtained from third-party brokers in law enforcement has drawn strong criticism from privacy advocates, since it effectively creates a loophole that lets agencies skirt processes of judicial review, such as the need to obtain a warrant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVPMLL"&gt;“Part of why utility records are so insidious is that you can opt out of a lot of digital services, but it’s hard to opt out of having electricity or running water,” said Albert Fox Cahn, executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP). “To make those lifeline utilities yet another tracking tool for ICE put undocumented families in an intolerable position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igqzzZ"&gt;“No matter where this information is coming from, the police shouldn’t be able to buy their way around the constitution,” Cahn added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vU3OXj"&gt;The CLEAR database, which is operated by media company Thomson Reuters, is currently subject to a &lt;a href="https://www.classlawgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/Thomson-Reuters-CLEAR-class-action-lawsuit.pdf"&gt;class action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; filed in California by STOP, Gibbs Law Group, Justice Catalyst Law, and Gupta Wessler PLLC. The lawsuit contends that the sale of information in the database violates the privacy of California residents. A motion to dismiss the lawsuit from Thomson Reuters was &lt;a href="https://www.courthousenews.com/judge-advances-privacy-claims-over-reuters-database/"&gt;rejected by a judge in April&lt;/a&gt;. The case is currently at the discovery phase. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube announces new year-end live event, Escape2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ooGePdsoPo3VwWxLUToyJLwfQBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250714/acastro_180321_1777_youtube_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQqmJa"&gt;YouTube will host a 24-hour interactive live event featuring musicians and creators to look back on the platform’s biggest trends and videos of 2021, the company announced today. The event, called Escape2021, will have three chapters, the first of which begins on December 16th at midnight ET. The goal of Escape2021: liberate &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJRHqCRvD0c"&gt;Lofi Girl&lt;/a&gt; from the confines of her bedroom and studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oSqOA"&gt;Escape2021 replaces YouTube Rewind, a high-production recap video YouTube published at the end of each year that had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129044/youtube-rewind-shane-dawson-logan-paul-jake-pewdiepie-vlog-squad-david-dobrik-boxing-ksi"&gt;derided by creators&lt;/a&gt; for sanitizing the platform to appeal to advertisers. The company officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714550/youtube-rewind-canceled-controversy-creators-annual-recap"&gt;pulled the plug&lt;/a&gt; on Rewind in October, saying it would “refocus our energies” to create different kinds of productions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyDbmD"&gt;The event seems to be an attempt by YouTube to offer more immersive online experiences, like when fans watched &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/bts-army-butter-melting-video-9564987/"&gt;butter melt&lt;/a&gt; ahead of a new BTS song. YouTube says there will be trivia questions, trend-based challenges, and “real-time live experiences,” all leading up to musical performances. One example of a challenge, echoing the BTS livestream, will require viewers to identify what butter sculptures the band has melted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASw5Bl"&gt;YouTube says the event will include performances and appearances from BTS, Doja Cat, and Mark Rober, among others. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter could bring universal casting that actually works</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hSjLQu7b-61QZ8vRbvaiJ56pc5g=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70249408/verge_IMG_8670_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;This Amazon-led casting standard for TVs could challenge Apple AirPlay and Google Cast &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eU6aaf"&gt;The new smart home standard Matter is making a lot of grand promises, chief among them are fixing the interoperability mess the smart home is currently in and making Apple, Samsung, Google, and Amazon talk to each other. Big jobs. But it’s also tackling one of the other pain points in the connected home: TV control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bm1PBy"&gt;One part of the new connectivity protocol is a specification for televisions and streaming video players. This means that Matter could become yet another way to control content in our homes. But, with its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter’s TV spec has the potential to replace proprietary casting systems, like Apple’s AirPlay or Google’s Cast, and finally free our TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m2niZc"&gt;Matter TV, as we’ll call it for wont of an official name, will allow control of a television’s core functions — volume up / down, changing the channel, controlling inputs and outputs, and switching between HDMI ports. “But importantly, you can also do casting,” Chris DeCenzo, Principal Software Development Engineer at Amazon Lab126, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oENWS1"&gt;“This is an area with at least five proprietary protocols today,” he says. “The result is a complete opportunity loss for everyone.” Not to mention major headaches for users as they grapple with which voice assistant can get this content and which remote will control that streaming stick. Amazon is leading the effort to define the specification for Matter — unsurprising, as it is currently the only large player without a proprietary way to cast content from a smartphone to a TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sv-CBjF74efHYHqQaY3CTpNuA3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13262367/jbareham_180726_2773_0087.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Controlling our smart TVs can feel anything but smart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1AsPEc"&gt;“Control of media is one of the most popular use cases for Alexa,” says DeCenzo, who told me Amazon is working with the different industry leaders in the fields of smart TVs, streaming video players, and content providers to help them adopt Matter. The goal is so that “customers can have a consistent way to use voice control and to launch their favorite content on those screens,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0NyUx"&gt;While the Matter TV specification doesn’t explicitly call out voice control, the idea here is standardization. One protocol for all device communication, everything will talk to everything else using the same language, no &lt;em&gt;matter&lt;/em&gt; who made it. Ultimately, this means you will be able to use your control interface of choice (a voice assistant, remote control, or smartphone / tablet app) with all your streaming content devices and apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7HxJWF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With its promise of platform agnosticism, Matter could finally free our TVs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rguZA0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;When Matter arrives in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, the Matter TV specification will use app-to-app communication, at least until the TVs and streaming video players become Matter enabled. The spec supports casting from a Matter client (e.g., a remote, a smart speaker, or a phone app) to an app running on a Matter-enabled TV or video player device, explains DeCenzo. It also supports URL-based casting, which means a Matter client can cast to a TV even when there’s no app for that client, if the TV supports Dynamic Adaptive Streaming (DASH, an international standard for streaming) or HLS DRM streams (HLS is a video streaming protocol developed by Apple and widely supported across Android devices and browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tus8PG"&gt;The capability could go beyond just entertainment and be used to enable smart home notifications, says Chris LaPré of the &lt;a href="https://csa-iot.org/"&gt;Connectivity Standards Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the organization that oversees the new standard. For example, it could cast a message from your connected doorbell to your smart TV, notifying you that someone is at the door. It could potentially show you the video feed, too, something of a workaround for including video feeds in Matter, since cameras are not part of the first device rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ietivWcwo5KkGDZsTA4bL1fY9k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23074285/f7484de0_fd1a_11eb_8eb4_4d8ac557fa35.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CSA / Matter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matter-enabled devices will have the Matter logo on them to indicate they’re compatible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="to2vl9"&gt;Intriguingly, LaPré posited that the specification could allow for the use of context when delivering these messages, such as notifying you from the smart speaker in the room you are in that your laundry is done. “It can be about casting anything, smart home notifications, local video — all it needs is a URL to pull content from,” says LaPré. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hntmBy"&gt;The technology here is not system-level specific, as with Apple’s AirPlay. It appears to be more akin to Google’s Cast, where apps will need to build support for it, at least initially. But like AirPlay, and as with all Matter communications, it’s entirely local. Communication from device to device uses Matter as the channel. At launch, Matter will use ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread as its communication protocols. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s30Vfu"&gt;The requirement for the app makers — such as Hulu and Netflix, who aren’t currently members of the CSA — to build Matter support could make this something of a non-starter initially. Beyond Amazon and its Prime Video and Google with YouTube, few of the major streaming content providers are part of the CSA, and the app developer will initially need to add Matter support to both the app in the phone or casting device (for example, a smart speaker, laptop, or smartphone) and the app in the receiving device (TV, streaming stick, smart display). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCw2XM"&gt;“You can have communication directly from the Prime Video app on my phone to the Prime Video app that’s on the TV,” explains DeCenzo. Going forward, according to LaPré, the streaming video players and TVs will have Matter built into the devices themselves, and at this point the apps in the receiving device won’t need to be Matter-enabled. It seems likely Amazon will enable Matter on its Fire TV devices, and the company has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;committed to upgrading all its smart speakers to support Matter&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung, TCL, Panasonic, and LG are all involved with Matter, as are Apple and Google. However, according to the list of companies on the &lt;a href="https://buildwithmatter.com/"&gt;Matter website&lt;/a&gt;, Vizio, Sony, Toshiba, and Roku are a few notable hardware players that are not yet signed up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JleYxe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is a consistent way to use voice control to launch content on any screen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BcAKqp"&gt;The main goal, however, is part of Matter’s overarching promise: avoiding manufacturer lock-in. People should be able to buy whichever device they choose and it should be able to talk to all the other connected devices in their home, regardless of who made it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjqOY9"&gt;For example, if both were Matter-enabled you should be able to control an LG TV from a Samsung smartphone, and that LG TV should be able to receive a message from a Miele smart washer that the laundry is done. But, and this is a big but, nothing in the overall Matter spec is a requirement. A company that is on board with Matter as a whole is under no obligation to adopt a certain device specification that they don’t need or want to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEcMbI"&gt;This means that Apple and Google do not have to adopt the Matter TV specification if they don’t want to (but if they do, they have to adopt it all, including casting). LaPré says both companies have “blessed this” as part of the spec (Matter is governed by members of the CSA who vote on the specifications). Whether they will adopt it remains to be seen. But if Amazon does, which seems like a good bet, it should mean you can use Matter to cast from your Amazon Prime app on your iPhone to your Amazon Prime app on your Apple TV or Google Chromecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1CPHb"&gt;I reached out to both Google and Apple about this specification and how it would impact their current offerings. Both companies have committed to supporting Matter in their respective smart home ecosystems and both are members of the CSA. Kevin Po of Google said in an email that “Google Assistant will support Matter (eg. on/off, play/pause, app launch etc.) at parity with our current Works With Assistant offering.” Apple did not comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="5nr5N9"&gt;Po went on to reiterate that Google Cast remains Google’s preferred method for sending media via apps and voice to Chromecasts, speakers, and displays. As, we can only assume at this stage, will Airplay be Apple’s “preferred method.” But what your preferred method will be could very soon involve a lot more choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKv5qW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated Thursday, December 9th, 1:20PM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that if a company chooses to adopt the Matter TV spec, it will need to adopt all of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="34SCdf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s big ambitions could be its Achilles’ heel in the Arm deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdXpUKg-DFNABFGRD11DkH_TFbI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250668/acastro_200804_1777_arm_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ch5WdR"&gt;Nvidia has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;trying to buy Arm for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt; for over a year now — but this week, the acquisition was hit with its biggest roadblock yet. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/d09404_part_3_complaint_public_version.pdf"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission laid out the case&lt;/a&gt; to stop the merger from going through, arguing that the deal would “stifle competing next-generation technologies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XcTeQ"&gt;It’s the most significant attempt to reign in Big Tech yet under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;Lina Khan’s term as FTC chair&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a lot at stake, both for the FTC and the electronics industry at large. Arm is a hugely important company; the company’s chip designs touch hundreds of billions of devices, including CPUs and ISPs for modern cars, embedded chipsets for wearable and medical devices, smart home gadgets like thermostats and routers, and of course, smartphone and laptop processors. The question of who controls it will have massive implications for all of them — and the FTC’s case now seems like it’ll be ​​the biggest barrier to the acquisition going through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7aHB4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The FTC is suing to block Nvidia’s $40 billion purchase of Arm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814633/nvidia-arm-purchase-semiconductor-ftc-40-billion-lawsuit-block-deal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RaL7X1"&gt;Nvidia already competes in at least some of the same fields as Arm licensees. The FTC and other regulators in the EU and UK are concerned that, because of that involvement, Nvidia could influence Arm’s future product development. It’s particularly worried that Nvidia would use its control over Arm to advance its own interests in emerging markets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/4/12/22380065/nvidia-grace-cpu-arm-data-center-ai-hpc"&gt;data centers&lt;/a&gt; and autonomous vehicles, instead of working to ensure that all the companies that use Arm designs to compete with Nvidia in those fields can continue to do so on an equal playing field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYaJga"&gt;Crucially, Arm doesn’t actually make its own chips: rather, it sells both licenses for companies to design their own chips that use Arm’s architecture (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;Apple’s M-series chips&lt;/a&gt; for Macs), in addition to selling entire CPU and GPU designs (like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1 CPU&lt;/a&gt; and Mali GPUs found in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google Tensor&lt;/a&gt; and Samsung Exynos 2100). But Arm’s architectures — which offer better power efficiency and customization options for device manufacturers — have steadily become a critical part of the computing landscape. It’s Arm’s technology, not the traditional x86 designs used by Intel and AMD, that has fueled the massive growth of smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices over the past two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oz4Tfl"&gt;The FTC makes its case by looking at three specific areas where Nvidia already licenses Arm’s technology: Nvidia’s advanced driver assistance chips and two types of data center chips. One of those data center chips is particularly important: the &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/10/29/what-is-a-smartnic/"&gt;DPU-based (data processing unit) SmartNIC&lt;/a&gt;, a core component of data center networking infrastructure, which provides both processing (thanks to Arm cores) and network interfacing for secure cloud infrastructure. Nvidia thinks they’re going to be a big deal, setting up that DPUs are set to be the “third pillar” of computing infrastructure, alongside traditional CPUs and GPUs. And virtually everyone that makes DPU SmartNICs — even Intel, the biggest x86 chip company around — uses Arm technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZDVcpU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even Intel, the biggest x86 chip company around — uses Arm technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgj0Hl"&gt;It’s a similar case for automotive vehicle assistance. Arm’s technology is used in virtually all the chips for enabling Level 2 and Level 3 assistive features in cars (which covers basic automated tasks like acceleration or lane changing while still having a human operator on standby). With the exception of Intel-owned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822279/intel-mobileye-ipo-2022-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi"&gt;Mobileye&lt;/a&gt;, every major chip in this field uses Arm — including Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOLAsZ"&gt;There are a couple of things to note here. The FTC is being very strategic in its examples, choosing areas that have a clear impact on the broader tech industry. But these three licensing deals also represent a very small part of Arm’s business. &lt;a href="https://group.softbank/system/files/pdf/ir/financials/annual_reports/annual-report_fy2020_01_en.pdf"&gt;As a SoftBank presentation&lt;/a&gt; from 2020 shows, its bread and butter is focused in mobile phones (where it dominates more than 90 percent of the market) and IoT application processors. On the automotive side, Arm claims to have 75 percent market share but doesn’t distinguish how much of that is for infotainment systems versus the kinds of driver assistance applications that the FTC is concerned about. And its presence in data centers is virtually nonexistent: Arm’s technology has just a 5 percent market share there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGJZvI"&gt;The FTC is making a broad case here — that a combined Nvidia / Arm would be willing to make moves that would hurt its competitors that rely on Arm’s architecture or designs, because the profits it could generate from better succeeding in these markets would outweigh the losses from licensees. But it’s relying on very specific parts of the business, which seems to open the door for some kind of compromise that would spin off the conflicting parts of the business while allowing the bulk of the acquisition to go through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j9mx7S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FTC has a long road ahead of it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v4D7Ku"&gt;In practice, that kind of compromise has been hard to achieve. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-the-ftc-rejected-nvidias-antitrust-settlement-for-75-billion-arm-deal"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia offered to spin out an independent licensing company for licensing out designs in an attempt to mollify regulators, but the plan failed due to concerns that Nvidia would still control Arm’s development of new products. So while Nvidia could try to divest itself of, say, Arm’s data center technology, thanks to the common architecture shared by Arm’s products, it would still be in charge of what kinds of features Arm would focus on to include in those chip designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JyKJfe"&gt;The FTC also highlights the fact that Nvidia would gain access to Arm’s customer list and be privy to sensitive information that companies share with Arm. “Nvidia’s ownership of Arm would fundamentally upend Arm’s status as a neutral partner and, at the same time, enable Nvidia to obtain access to its rivals’ competitively sensitive information.” The regulatory group also notes that Arm licensees that compete with Nvidia might be less willing to work with the company to help further improve Arm, in addition to skewing future development of Arm’s products in directions that benefit Nvidia specifically, rather than the broader Arm ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oCpUTz"&gt;Of all the FTC’s arguments, Nvidia seems most prepared for this one: back when the deal was first announced, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.” The company has since reiterated that the merger would “boost competition, [and] create more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoayVN"&gt;This puts the FTC in a delicate position as it heads to court. But the specific examples that regulators are using to prove it are very specific and less integral to Arm’s overall business strategy than, say, concerns about competition for its major CPU and GPU products. After decades of relatively lax oversight, it’s hard to say how any antitrust case will fare in court — so even the slightest weakness in the case could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eneLPE"&gt;On the other hand, the FTC also doesn’t necessarily have to win to block the deal. It just has to hold out long enough that Nvidia decides that the deal isn’t worth the trouble, especially since Nvidia’s deal with current Arm owner SoftBank only gives the US chip company until the end of 2022 to clear regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Gj5gF"&gt;Behind all of it is a very nervous electronics industry. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns"&gt;Google, Microsoft, Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;, and Tesla have all objected to the deal, and the concerns that Nvidia ownership could influence Arm’s development and stifle innovation are very real. The only question now is whether the FTC can make the case work in court.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA launches new X-ray mission to study black holes and exploding stars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo showing the imaging x-ray polarimetry explorer that launched in space early Thursday morning" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p0fLWv5AG8lwXMv0CNSyQz-QlB8=/313x0:3688x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250650/ixpe_003.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer  | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sRG9a5"&gt;On Thursday morning, NASA’s Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-launches-new-mission-to-explore-universe-s-most-dramatic-objects"&gt;successfully launched&lt;/a&gt; into space on top of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The two-year mission, a joint effort with the Italian Space Agency, is NASA’s first mission dedicated to studying and measuring X-ray polarization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0iAHm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ixpe/overview.html"&gt;pioneering mission&lt;/a&gt; will allow NASA to look into the origins of X-ray light, a form of high energy light produced during some of the most extreme celestial events like supernova explosions and violent collisions. The mission builds on the work done by the &lt;a href="https://chandra.harvard.edu/"&gt;Chandra X-ray Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s flagship X-ray astronomy mission, which launched in 1999 and has imaged the remnants of exploded stars, discovered black holes, and more.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The IXPE will provide more insight into the astrophysical phenomena Chandra has studied in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQulvr"&gt;The IXPE will begin operations in January, NASA reports. During its first year, IXPE will study about 40 celestial objects with detailed follow-up observations in its second year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ci6PiA"&gt;The IXPE mission consists of three identical telescopes containing mirrors that will collect X-rays emanating from celestial objects, like supermassive black holes, and focus them onto detectors that can measure their polarization. Polarized light is light whose vibrations are all aligned in a single direction, unlike the visible light from a lightbulb, which scatters in every direction. By studying its properties, astronomers can learn more about what sort of environment it came from and passed through on its journey throughout the cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gWO5S"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/ixpe/overview.html"&gt;NASA&lt;/a&gt;, the mission will provide long-awaited answers to questions like how black holes spin, whether the black hole at the center of our galaxy was actively feeding on surrounding material in the past, and why pulsars emit so much X-ray light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4X6ZoM"&gt;The IXPE observatory separated from the rocket about 33 minutes into flight before unfurling its solar arrays and entering an orbit around Earth’s equator. Forty minutes after the launch, mission operators received the first set of telemetry data from the spacecraft, NASA wrote in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuG9p0"&gt;Though an overshadowed one, the IXPE launch is a major victory for NASA as the agency preps for the &lt;a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/content/about/launch.html"&gt;December 22nd launch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663027/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date"&gt;James Webb Telescope&lt;/a&gt;, NASA’s next major eyes in the sky. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chevy Silverado EV pickup truck will go into production early 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9BNHr7HpgMHKmdeZmue3ANP3_-0=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250648/Chevrolet_Silverado_E_Teaser.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fAoYEy"&gt;The Chevy Silverado EV will go into production in early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/cars-concepts/chevrolet-silverado-ev-output-slated-begin-2023"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The electric truck, which will make its public debut in a few weeks at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January in Las Vegas, will go on sale in late 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V078cJ"&gt;The Silverado EV will be the second electric truck for General Motors, succeeding the GMC Hummer EV, which is expected to reach a handful of its first customers before the end of 2021. But when it comes out, the electric Silverado will be one of the flagship vehicles in the company’s much larger $35 billion push into electric vehicles, as well as the first electric truck for the automaker’s Chevy brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SDmrpY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Silverado’s production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1RY9vK"&gt;But when it hits dealerships in late 2023, it will find a number of electric trucks already on the market, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;Rivian R1T&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;. The Silverado’s production will lag behind the F-150 Lightning, which is expected to go into production in spring 2022. (Ford recently shut down reservations for the F-150 Lightning after receiving nearly 200,000 orders.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Bn78m"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built on GM’s Ultium battery pack and electric drivetrain that is also being used to power the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;Hummer truck and SUV&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357717/cadillac-lyriq-gm-ev-suv-touchscreen-size-specs-release-date"&gt;Cadillac Lyriq&lt;/a&gt;, and other upcoming EVs. GM claims the Silverado will get more than 400 miles of range on a full charge. And it will be sold in both consumer and fleet versions, much like the Ford F-150 Lightning. GM has also revealed that the truck will come with all-wheel steering, as well as a “fixed-glass roof.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjjrIQ"&gt;The Silverado EV will be built at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519358/gm-factory-zero-detroit-hamtramck-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;Factory Zero&lt;/a&gt;, GM’s EV plant in Detroit, alongside the Hummer EV pickup and SUV and the Cruise Origin, the automaker’s purpose-built autonomous shuttle. GM CEO Mary Barra will reveal more details about the Silverado EV &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712710/general-motors-investor-day-chevy-silverado-ev-2022-consumer-electronics-show"&gt;during her keynote speech at CES&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="bHGR3M"&gt;With recent flash sales, console drops, and daily deals that have even matched some of Black Friday’s best, you can feel that holiday shopping is soon reaching its final form. We are approaching the time where you want to give the calendar the occasional check and ensure that anything you’re ordering as a gift will arrive in time. Today, we have a smattering of excellent deals from many areas of the tech landscape, some of which can make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759813/holiday-gift-guide-best-tech-gadget-unique-ideas"&gt;an excellent gift&lt;/a&gt; for a loved one or just save a load of money for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kFM5SF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for creators","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746670/holiday-gift-ideas-2021-creators-content-artists-tech-gadgets-creative"},{"title":"The Verge’s favorite holiday gifts under $50","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22748775/holiday-gift-guide-under-50-cheap-tech-gadgets-best-ideas"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="f1ZXk2"&gt;Kicking it off, we have Amazon’s deal of the day, which, unsurprisingly, is featuring one of its own lines of products. Eero is a popular option for simplified mesh Wi-Fi that can cover your entire home, and for today only, you can get a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WMLPSRL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-pack of the base-model Eeros for just $159 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; — a discount of $40. While these are not the fancier and more expensive Wi-Fi 6 or Pro versions, that is an impeccable price for a fast and convenient home mesh Wi-Fi solution. If you have a very large home or particularly impervious walls to work around, you can even get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PBWBTH3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 off a four-pack&lt;/a&gt;, which brings that price down to just $199. There is fierce competition in the home Wi-Fi space from the likes of Google’s Nest, but nothing can touch a price like this right now. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20912347/eero-mesh-router-wifi-system-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UzDO4L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10911115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rGykwG"&gt;For our next deal, you might wonder, “Who doesn’t already own &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;? It’s one of the best games on the Nintendo Switch.” Well, first, you’re right — it is one of the best games for the Switch. And for any Switch owners out there that don’t already own it, it’s worth considering at any price. But thankfully, today, you can get this all-time great for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgaEyIDYzLV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.99 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It has dipped a little bit lower before in price before, but you can’t pass this up before the holidays if you’re in need of a gift for someone who just got a new Switch or Switch OLED Model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="vJWDoy"&gt;The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 came out recently and brought many of the updates and changes we’d been asking for, but it’s also a fairly expensive machine once you properly outfit it. The Surface Pro 7 Plus, on the other hand, is an excellent last-generation option if you’re looking for a portable productivity machine on a budget. This special price at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Pro-7-2-In-1-12-3-Touch-Screen-Intel-Core-i3-8GB-RAM-128GB-SSD-Windows-11-Home-Platinum-with-Black-Type-Cover%2F351505806&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals120921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart of just $599&lt;/a&gt; — a savings of $401 — is a Black Friday price that has made a welcome comeback. It features an Intel Core i3 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD. Since this is a Surface Pro 7 Plus, that SSD is removable, so you can always upgrade the storage later. Add in the included type cover, and you have a fantastic value for a Surface Pro computer. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309005/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="70myKe"&gt;Now from a quality deal on a laptop to a deal on a quality laptop charger, the Ravpower 65W GaN dual USB-C charger is on a hefty sale. This charger is small and portable, but it can charge a 15-inch MacBook or even charge a MacBook Air and a phone at the same time. It also features power delivery 3.0 so that charging happens as quick as a compatible device can receive those electrons. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2Fproducts%2Frp-pc145-65w-gan-tech-2-port-usb-c-fast-charger%3Fvariant%3D33028738515019&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825839%2Feero-mesh-wifi-router-nintendo-switch-zelda-microsoft-surface-pro-ravpower-sigma-sonos-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ravpower is selling it directly with a $22 discount&lt;/a&gt; — just $18 when you use promo code &lt;strong&gt;DNS145&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PKMfxs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Who wins when Amazon pulls brands from its store?

&lt;p id="MBcsty"&gt;And now for something completely different. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1516303-REG%2Fsigma_24_70mm_f_2_8_dg_dn.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F12%2F9%2F22825839%2Feero-mesh-wifi-router-nintendo-switch-zelda-microsoft-surface-pro-ravpower-sigma-sonos-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has $200 off&lt;/a&gt; the excellent Sigma 24-70mm f/2.8 DG DN Art lens in both L-Mount and E-Mount for today only, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sigma-24-70mm-F2-8-Mount-578965/dp/B081L5HJBP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is matching it. That brings the price of this lens down to $899, its lowest price ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HauaFk"&gt;If you’re a photography or video enthusiast using either of those full-frame systems, there are few mid-range zoom lenses out there that best this Sigma lens — and none of them come close to this price. I tested the Sigma 24-70mm personally earlier this year, and while it may have some shortcomings in the build quality department, it is an exceptional lens that can be a staple zoom for an enthusiast or even a pro.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Meta opens up access to its VR social platform Horizon Worlds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6MPBigaPnW1dzCbmcXhtNZuW_08=/61x0:720x439/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250534/CreateAWorldOfYourOwn_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zl4s5j"&gt;More than two years and a company rebrand later, Meta is finally opening up access to its VR social platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21405249/facebook-vr-space-horizon-access-public-beta"&gt;Horizon Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. Starting Thursday, people in the US and Canada who are 18 and up will be able to access the free Quest app without an invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAWgZa"&gt;Horizon Worlds is Meta’s first attempt at releasing something that resembles CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse. It’s an expansive, multiplayer platform that meshes &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;and the OASIS VR world from &lt;em&gt;Ready Player One&lt;/em&gt;. Originally just called Horizon, it requires a Facebook account and lets you hang out with up to 20 people at a time in a virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NdSR0x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Now we can open up and say we have interesting things that people can do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g8x3aA"&gt;First announced in September 2019 as a private beta, Horizon Worlds has evolved from primarily being a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;-like environment for building games to more of a social platform. Its thousands of beta testers have held regular comedy shows, movie nights, and meditation sessions. They’ve also built elaborate objects like a replica of the Ecto-1 from &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters.&lt;/em&gt; “Now we can open up and say we have interesting things that people can do,” Vivek Sharma, Meta’s VP of Horizon, tells me&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bdJoBb"&gt;During a demo of Horizon Worlds, I was greeted by a few Meta employees at the Plaza, a central gathering place used to enter custom worlds and games built by users. We first visited a creator lounge area where you try custom items being built, like a bow and arrow or paper plane launcher, and enter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714876/facebook-horizon-worlds-creators-fund-social-vr-platform-metaverse"&gt;building competitions to win cash prizes&lt;/a&gt;. Then we hopped to another world and divided up into teams to play a battle royale shooting game. After that, I was given a demo of Horizon’s building tools that let you create a world and items from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLCmoD"&gt;A key part of Horizon Worlds is the ability to write basic code that sets rules for how objects work, such as a gun shooting when you press the trigger or a ball bouncing when it touches a surface. The code, which Meta calls script blocks, acts similarly to layers in Photoshop by letting you chain together rules to create complex interactions, such as a leaderboard that automatically updates after a game is finished. “Attaching behaviors to objects is actually one of the biggest innovations that I’m proud of for the team,” says Sharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2AgZyP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10910683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nRYVM"&gt;He says that, so far, Meta employees have been making the script blocks at the request of beta testers and that the company eventually plans to release a free library of them. An asset library of objects is also coming. Right now, the coding for script blocks is done entirely in VR, but eventually, Meta plans to let them be built from a desktop computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FHEA7"&gt;Safety is a big concern for a VR environment like Horizon Worlds, where you can easily interact with someone you don’t know. Earlier this month, a beta tester posted in the official Horizon group on Facebook about how her avatar was groped by a stranger. “Sexual harassment is no joke on the regular internet, but being in VR adds another layer that makes the event more intense,” she wrote. “Not only was I groped last night, but there were other people there who supported this behavior which made me feel isolated in the Plaza.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qSf2R"&gt;Sharma calls the incident “absolutely unfortunate” and says that after Meta reviewed the incident, the company determined that the beta tester didn’t utilize the safety features built into Horizon Worlds, including the ability to block someone from interacting with you.  (When you’re in Horizon, a rolling buffer of what you see is saved locally on your Oculus headset and then sent to Meta for human review if an incident is reported.) “That’s good feedback still for us because I want to make [the blocking feature] trivially easy and findable,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wWiDaB"&gt;Another unique aspect of Horizon Worlds is the human guides that exist to greet new users as they teleport from the Plaza to different worlds. These guides are power users that Meta employees train to know best practices for navigating Horizon and following its behavior rules. Sharma calls it “one of those areas where we’re doing unscalable things to keep the environment to be a place that’s healthy for communities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fnwexr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Creation is kind of the product”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btfkuK"&gt;For now, there’s no way to make money in Horizon Worlds, either as a creator, guide, or player. The plan is to eventually tie it into Horizon Venues, a standalone experience for throwing large events in VR, and Horizon Workrooms, its VR work collaboration software. Until monetization is added, Meta hopes that the world-building aspect of Worlds will entice people. “The act of creating itself is part of the appeal of this thing,” says Sharma. “Creation is kind of the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1S6FoC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YubksD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nqhGF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard employees create strike fund while taking steps toward unionization</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cOCZ9eegj-a5rPExu-6M0aBdDuo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70250279/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JA9wq8"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/abk-strike-fund"&gt;GoFundMe&lt;/a&gt; has been created to support employees participating in the latest work stoppage at Activision Blizzard. This latest walkout comes after the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;a round of layoffs&lt;/a&gt; in the QA department of one of its subsidiaries, Raven Software, right before the holiday season. Though initially contained to the Wisconsin-based studio, the walkout spread to QA departments in Texas and Minnesota with many other employees not in QA departments joining in solidarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zIVfm"&gt;“Funds raised from this donation effort will contribute to offsetting wages lost from the work stoppage,” says the GoFundMe organized by Jessica Gonzalez, a Blizzard employee known for her activism and outspoken criticism of her employer, “as well as to assist in the potential relocation of Raven Software workers who were forced to move without financial assistance at the insistence of Activision Blizzard.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po3zqN"&gt;After news of the Raven Software layoffs broke, Treyarch, another Activision Blizzard studio known for developing several games in the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; franchise, converted all of its temporary staff &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1467936015071559683"&gt;to full-time employees&lt;/a&gt;. The workers involved in the Raven Software walkout are hoping for the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjEVKy"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/09/activision-union-strike-fund/"&gt;a report by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, unionization efforts are ramping up behind these walkouts with workers being asked to sign union authorization cards. Activision Blizzard employee advocacy group &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK"&gt;A Better ABK&lt;/a&gt; has worked with the CWA — a digital media and tech organizer — since news of rampant sexual harassment, discrimination, and abuse at the company broke this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COYuLj"&gt;The GoFundMe is asking for $1 million in funds and has raised almost $40,000 since its creation early this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
